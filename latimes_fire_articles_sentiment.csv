La Habra earthquake jolted social media,https://www.latimes.com/local/la-me-earthquake-social-media-20140401-story.html,2014-04-01,"The magnitude 5.1 La Habra earthquake that shook Southern California isn’t going into the seismic history books for its modest size and small damage totals.
But it was an event on social media, which transmitted stories and images of the quake and its many aftershocks with a speed and breadth that left seismologists and emergency personnel taking notice.
The first signs of damage came not from authorities but from residents posting photos on Facebook of broken dishes and fallen cabinets. The public learned that Disneyland rides were closed from scores of photos tweeted by park visitors. In 15 words and a photo on Twitter, Brea police announced that the quake caused a significant rockslide that flipped a car, resulting in the only injuries from the quake.
By Saturday, U.S. Geological Survey seismologist Lucy Jones had become a trending topic on Twitter and finally created an account. (After some playful debate, she used @DrLucyJones as her account name rather than her nickname, the Earthquake Lady). In her first tweet, she assured those on social media that the large aftershocks still rattling across Orange and Los Angeles counties were normal.
The real-time reporting of a quake provides many opportunities but also some pitfalls. Officials can use the stream of data to determine where damage has occurred and allocate resources. The challenge is sorting between the valuable facts and the misinformation and speculation.
“This is sort of the evolution where 30 years ago, we’d have an earthquake and we’d all listen to KFWB, and people called in to talk about what they felt,” Jones said, “and there’d be no information for another hour until we found out the magnitude and more information on the actual earthquake.”
With social media, it’s the same principle, but the timing has accelerated, Jones said.
“People need to talk to other people when they’re scared. And if we don’t communicate quickly, it doesn’t stop people from talking, it just means they don’t have factual information to share,” she said.
Indeed, as aftershocks continued through the weekend, some people said they went to Twitter to see if what they were feeling was a quake or nothing but a truck rolling by.
The USGS was a pioneer in digital crowdsourcing by creating a system for people to report whenever they felt a quake. More than 16,000 reports were sent to the Did You Feel It? system after Friday’s earthquake. Based on the surveys, the USGS produces maps showing where the quakes were felt the most.
But in an era of second screens and the mobile Web, some experts say seismologists need a larger presence in social media.
“Places like Caltech and the USGS need to get on Twitter,” USC social media professor Karen North said, “so that when the torrent of tweets go out talking about this earthquake’s implications for future earthquakes, they can go into that communication channel and correct false information and lead people to facts.”
Scott Horvath, Web and social media chief for the USGS, agreed that there is an expectation for instant feedback on what happened.
“We try to send out as much as we can, the basic information that we know that everyone is going to need,” he said. “It’s not efficient to wait for someone to respond hours after an earthquake happens ... and in between that time, if you don’t hear what’s going on, people can start coming up with their own stories.”
When a earthquake occurs, the USGS Twitter account helps direct people to the agency’s Did You Feel It? site.
An estimated 17 million people felt the magnitude 5.1 quake, said USGS seismologist David Wald, and the USGS received valuable information from 16,000 reports by individuals who used Did You Feel It?
“About 1 in 1,000 are actually reporting.... That’s a pretty good [data] sample. If you’re polling for political responses, that would be a huge sample,” said Wald, who co-created and operates the Did You Feel It? system.
Before the system was created in 1999 as part of an undergraduate project at Caltech, the USGS sent postal questionnaires to ZIP Codes in an area that experienced an earthquake. People filled them out and it would take months to compile the information that now can be done automatically through a computer.
Wald said that unlike the torrents of information posted on Twitter and Facebook after an earthquake, the questions people respond to for Did You Feel It? are well-tuned inquiries that seismologists have asked for decades — streamlining the information that comes in and giving scientists usable, sortable data that helps determine such things as intensity and how far the shaking traveled.
The real-time reporting aspect of social media, however, can offer snapshots of an earthquake’s effect that first responders say they cannot ignore.
“I was at home when this earthquake hit and the first thing I did was turn over my iPad and go to Facebook,” Brea Police Capt. Gregg Hayden said. “People were already talking about it.’
Within a few minutes, dispatches were pouring in from across Southern California. Near the epicenter, people tweeted photos of damaged homes and broken water mains. Others wrote about the surreal experience of rolling through a quake while watching the new movie “Noah.”
Hayden said the struggle is to use the information that is essential to emergency personnel while ignoring the rest.
After the La Habra earthquake, more than a few people referred to the shaker as “huge,” when in fact the quake’s size falls under the category of moderate.
“Generally, the human tendency we see on Twitter and social media is to amplify and spread rumors without any filter,” said Jeffrey I. Cole, director and chief executive of USC’s Center for the Digital Future. “You just get to see everyone’s version of the truth.”
What Twitter is very good at is showing the scope of one event, like an earthquake, Cole said.
“That part is reliable,” he said. “But to really understand it, that’s where a Lucy Jones plays an important role.”
But there are drawbacks to a society that is so wired. Friday’s quake was big enough to be felt across the region, but small enough not to interrupt the digital infrastructure.
Experts have long warned that a massive quake could cut off Internet lines and cause major power outages. Twitter, Facebook and other social media may be inaccessible to hard-hit communities for days.
And that would leave people with their old-fashioned means of getting information, like sitting by their portable radios.

Temperatures near 100 expected Thursday; fire warnings extended,https://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-ln-temperatures-near-100-expected-20140430-story.html,2014-05-01,"The National Weather Service extended its red flag fire warnings through Thursday morning and predicted that temperatures could near 100 degrees in downtown Los Angeles and other areas as high pressure continues to grip the region.
The Santa Ana winds that buffeted the region and fanned a1,000 acre wildfire burning out of controlin the San Bernardino National Forest had subsided Wednesday night, but were expected to intensify early Thursday, the Weather Service said.
Gusts from 60 mph to 70 mph were expected in mountain areas of Ventura and Los Angeles counties. Record highs for Wednesday were set from the Central Coast to Southern California, including an 89-degree reading at Los Angeles International Airport. That broke a record of 86 degrees set in 1996.
The high winds knocked out power lines that affected thousands of people in San Bernardino, Riverside and Los Angeles counties, utility officials said.
The heavy winds whipped the Etiwanda fire in the San Bernardino National Forest near Rancho Cucamonga. More than 700 firefighters were battling the blaze Wednesday night.
The cause was under investigation.

Classes canceled as Etiwanda fire rages near Rancho Cucamonga,https://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-ln-classes-canceled-etiwanda-fire-20140430-story.html,2014-05-01,"Classes at four high schools were canceled for Thursday because of poor air quality caused by a wildfire raging out of control in the San Bernardino National Forest near Rancho Cucamonga.
The Etiwanda fire was fanned by powerful Santa Ana winds and had charred at least 1,000 acres of parched chaparral-and-brush-covered hillsides after breaking out Wednesday morning in the Day Canyon area, fire officials said.
The winds had calmed Wednesday night, but hot spots could be seen flaring up, according to television news footage.
Earlier in the day, winds were 60 mph to 80 mph with one gust up to 101 mph, the U.S. Forest Service said.
Classes at Etiwanda, Alta Loma Rancho and Los Osos high schools were canceled for Thursday, officials with the Chaffey Joint Union High School District said.
More than 700 firefighters were battling the blaze on the ground. Water-dropping helicopters and fixed-wing tankers were assigned to the incident but were unable to fly because of the high winds, fire officials said.
Earlier in the day, roughly 1,650 homes were evacuated as deputies went door to door to warn residents, and firefighters scrambled to knock down flames and chase spot fires that were caused by the strong Santa Ana winds.
Mandatory evacuations were lifted Wednesday evening for the hundreds of residents who were forced to flee flames and smoke. Fire officials said voluntary evacuations were still in place for homes north of Hillside Road between Haven and Milliken avenues.
As huge clouds of smoke billowed Wednesday afternoon, Barbora Konecna watched as a half-dozen firefighters worked around her Banyan Street home, clearing brush and spraying water on its roof. All of the sprinklers in the yard were on, dousing the vegetation and eucalyptus trees that surrounded the two-story house.
The 40-year-old Konecna saw some smoke when she left her house about 8 a.m. to take her children to school, but said she didn’t think much of it. By the time she returned home to grab her kids’ forgotten snacks, the smoke was thicker and the winds were blowing it directly toward her house.
Konecna packed up her family’s documents and important belongings, and called a friend to figure out how to turn on the safety sprinklers that came with her house. The firefighters arrived soon after, parking two rigs on her property.
“Any time they tell me it’s time to go, I can get out of here. I don’t want to be in anyone’s way,” she said. “With the wind going the way it is, you just don’t know.”
The blaze exploded in size over the morning, from 20 acres when it was first reported shortly after 8 a.m. to more than 800 acres by midday as winds whipped along steep terrain.
The South Coast Air Quality Management District, meanwhile, issued a smoke advisory for portions of western San Bernardino and Riverside counties.

Earlier in the day, roughly 1,650 homes were evacuated as deputies went door to door to warn residents and firefighters scrambled to knock down flames and chase spot fires that were caused by the strong Santa Ana winds.
Some gusts hit 80 mph as the Etiwanda fire charred at least 1,000 acres in the San Bernardino National Forest, officials said.
The high winds forced officials to ground water-dropping helicopters and fixed-wing tankers, complicating the task of fighting the fire as it zigzagged along the parched brush-and-chaparral covered hillsides.
More than 580 firefighters were battling the blaze on the ground. They included strike teams of fire engines assigned to protect homes, bulldozer teams to create larger fire breaks and hand crews to cut containment lines along the flanks of the rapidly moving fire.

"Wildfire threatens Rancho Cucamonga homes as residents watch, flee",https://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-ln-wildfire-threatens-rancho-cucamonga-homes-20140430-story.html,2014-04-30,"As the wind-driven wildfire in the San Bernardino National Forest spread Wednesday to the edge of Rancho Cucamonga, many residents fled while others watched as firefighters worked to protect their homes.
Barbora Konecna, 40, watched as a half-dozen firefighters worked around her Banyan Street home, clearing brush and spraying water on its roof. All of the sprinklers in the yard were on, dousing the vegetation and eucalyptus trees that surrounded the two-story house.
Konecna saw some smoke when she left her house about 8 a.m. to take her children to school, but said she didn’t think much of it. By the time she returned home to grab her kids’ forgotten snacks, the smoke was thicker and the winds were blowing smoke directly toward her house.
Konecna packed up her family’s documents and important belongings, and called a friend to figure out how to turn on the safety sprinklers that came with her house. The firefighters arrived soon after, parking two rigs on her property.
“Any time they tell me it’s time to go, I can get out of here. I don’t want to be in anyone’s way,” she said. “With the wind going the way it is, you just don’t know.”
The Etiwanda fire exploded in size over the morning, from 20 acres when it was first reported shortly after 8 a.m. to more than 800 acres by midday, fueled in large part by hot, dry conditions and powerful Santa Ana winds. Some gusts hit 80 mph, preventing air crews from making water drops all morning, U.S. Forest Service officials said.
Roughly 1,650 homes had been evacuated at the base of the burn area by 2 p.m.
Konecna was teary-eyed as she watched, wondering aloud whether her home would survive.
“I thought, ‘Am I coming back here tomorrow?’ ” she said. “It’s emotional, but as long as everybody’s safe, we’re OK.”
Rancho Cucamonga Fire Capts. Mike McCliman and Ty Harris were two of the firefighters at Konecna’s house. They surveyed the thick, black smoke billowing across a nearby field, a hot spot spewing reddish flames less than 200 yards away.
“It’s a real messy fire,” Harris said.
The main concern, Harris said, were the “very erratic” winds. He recalled the 2003 Grand Prix fire, which burned in the same area.
“We stood right here on Banyan and watched the fire do the same thing,” he said.
An estimated 550 personnel and 30 engines were assigned to fight the blaze with aircraft available, according to the Forest Service.
The South Coast Air Quality Management District, meanwhile, issued a smoke advisory for portions of western San Bernardino and Riverside counties, as well as eastern Los Angeles County as air quality reached unhealthful levels due to the fire.
The Etiwanda fire was first spotted in the Day Canyon area north of the 210 Freeway, according to the Forest Service.
The mandatory evacuation area included homes north of Wilson Avenue, between Etiwanda Avenue and Day Canyon Wash, directly below the wildfire. The zone was also expanded on the eastern front to include homes on Banyan Street.
A temporary shelter was set up for evacuees at Central Park, at the northwest corner of Milliken Avenue and Base Line Road. Animals can also be taken to the county animal shelter at 19777 Shelter Way in Devore, which can be reached at (909) 887-8055.

Gusty winds prevent air attack on growing Etiwanda wildfire,https://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-ln-gusty-winds-etiwanda-fire-20140430-story.html,2014-04-30,"A fast-moving wildfire in Day Canyon is 800 acres and growing in the Etiwanda Reserve north of Rancho Cucamonga.
Strong, gusty winds that are preventing firefighters from using aircraft to attack the Etiwanda wildfire in San Bernardino County are expected to blow through Thursday afternoon, the National Weather Service says.
Red flag warnings and wind advisories were scheduled to expire around 4 p.m. Thursday, said NWS specialist Stuart Seto. Blustery conditions — although not as strong — will persist through Friday afternoon, when a cooling trend is expected to begin, he said.
The winds have made it difficult for firefighters to attack the Etiwanda fire in the San Bernardino National Forest. It has burned 800 acres since igniting Wednesday morning and forced the evacuation of more than 1,000 homes and some schools in Rancho Cucamonga.
PHOTOS: Etiwanda fire
Cal Fire spokeswoman Liz Brown said winds in the mountains were gusting Wednesday at 80 mph, preventing the use of aircraft to make water drops.
Forecasters say winds in the foothills and valleys were blowing from 20 to 40 mph with gusts up to 60 mph. In the mountains winds were peaking at up to 90 mph.
The South Coast Air Quality Management District issued a smoke advisory for portions of western San Bernardino and Riverside counties and eastern Los Angeles County.
Weather officials said winds would decrease late Wednesday afternoon, picking up again at night.

Wildfire above Rancho Cucamonga grows to 800 acres; residents flee,https://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-ln-etiwanda-fire-mandatory-evacuations-20140430-story.html,2014-04-30,"Abetted by hotter, drier conditions and pushed by strong winds, the Etiwanda wildfire has burned over 1,000 acres near Rancho Cucamonga.
A fast-moving wildfire above Rancho Cucamonga exploded in size to 800 acres Wednesday as strong winds drove flames relentlessly and forced authorities to expand mandatory evacuation areas.
About 1,100 homes had been evacuated by midday, and at least one was saved from advancing flames, said Liz Brown, a spokeswoman for Cal Fire.
While an exact size of the burn area was not immediately available, officials said the fire had grown to more than 200 acres roughly two hours after it was first reported about 8 a.m. as being a 20-acre brush fire.
[Updated 1:11 p.m. PDT:San Bernardino forest officials have confirmed the size of the blaze is now 800 acres.]
Driven by powerful Santa Ana winds,the Etiwanda fire was burningin the Day Canyon area north of the 210 Freeway, according to the U.S. Forest Service.
The mandatory evacuation area included homes north of Wilson Avenue, between Etiwanda Avenue and Day Creek Wash, directly below the wildfire. The zone was also expanded on the eastern front to include homes on Banyan Street.
Angelique Lazier, 43, yelled over her fence as she and her neighbors prepared to leave their Carriage Place homes. “We think it burned up some equipment over there,” she said, pointing to a fresh plume of black smoke near a rock quarry.
Lazier’s husband, race car driver Jaques Lazier, watered down the vegetation at the back of their property. The couple said that was the area that burned during the last fire, the Grand Prix, in 2003. They were evacuated during that blaze, but later allowed to return to their home. But the flames spread unexpectedly, and the Laziers woke up to firefighters banging on their door in the middle of the night, telling them to leave.
This time the couple was ready. Both of their cars were packed.
“If it shifts back on us, we’re out of here,” Angelique Lazier said. “We’re gone.”
A temporary shelter was set up for evacuees at Central Park, at the northwest corner of Milliken Avenue and Base Line Road. Animals can also be taken to the county animal shelter at 19777 Shelter Way in Devore, which can be reached at (909) 887-8055.
As heavy smoke billowed through Rancho Cucamonga and flames reached the canyons above Day Creek Intermediate School at about 9:30 a.m., officials canceled classes at multiple campuses, including Day Creek, Caryn Elementary, Los Osos High School and Chaffey College.
The Etiwanda School District voluntarily moved students from Colony Elementary to Terra Vista Elementary, according to the San Bernardino County Sheriff’s Department.
Powerful winds with gusts of up to 80 mph had prevented air crews from making water drops all morning as flames whipped through canyons and along ridges.
The gusty winds combined with temperatures nearing 100 degrees prompted red flag warnings across much of the region Wednesday.
“It’s going to be a challenge, but we anticipated these fire conditions because of the fire warning,” Brown told KTLA-TV earlier in the day.
An estimated 550 personnel and 30 engines were assigned to fight the blaze with aircraft “available,” according to the Forest Service.
The South Coast Air Quality Management District, meanwhile, issued a smoke advisory for portions of western San Bernardino and Riverside counties, as well as eastern Los Angeles County as air quality reached unhealthy levels due to the fire.

"Body of Guatemalan boy, 11, found in south Texas desert scrub",https://www.latimes.com/nation/nationnow/la-na-nn-boy-body-found-border-020140630-story.html,2014-06-30,"Reporting from McAllen, Texas  —The body of an 11-year-old Guatemalan boy with a rosary around his neck was found in the south Texas desert scrub earlier this month, officials said Monday, the same day Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson toured a Border Patrol station and warned parents against illegally sending their children on the long, dangerous trip north.
“The journey is not safe,” Johnson said at the Border Patrol’s station in McAllen, Texas, about 20 miles from where the boy’s body was found June 15. Johnson added that children who crossed the border recently would not qualify for the Deferred Act for Childhood Arrivals, which shields some immigrants who came as undocumented children from prosecution and deportation.
The Hidalgo County sheriff’s office said the boy’s body was found in brush near the border town of La Joya, Texas. Authorities worked with the Guatemalan consulate and concluded the child was from Chiantla, Huehuetenango in Guatemala.
An autopsy on the decomposed remains did not reveal any trauma to explain how the boy died. But a phone number was found inscribed in the brown belt the boy had been wearing. Authorities said it connected them with a person identifying himself as the brother of an 11-year-old who was last seen crossing into the United States with his uncle. That boy was last seen 25 days before the younster’s body was found.
The uncle had been detained by the Border Patrol and didn’t see his nephew again, family members told authorities. The boy, investigators said, was named Gilberto Francisco Ramos Juarez.
Also in mid-June, the body of a 16-year-old Central American boy who died from exposure was found on ranch land 70 miles north of the border in Brooks County, Texas.
In a brief news conference on Monday, Johnson said he was confident a solution to the issue of unaccompanied minors crossing the border illegally would be found.
Johnson spoke at about the same time President Obama announced in Washington that he planned to use his executive authority to “fix as much of our immigration system as I can on my own, without Congress” because House Republicans haven not taken action to overhaul immigration laws.
Obama said the current crisis of tens of thousands of children arriving at the border from Central America is not a valid reason for Congress to hold off on passing comprehensive immigration legislation, as many Republican members of Congress have said.
Obama also repeated that minors who have arrived in recent months will be sent back to their countries of origin, a message that the administration has tried to send Central Americans.
Earlier in the day, the White House began pressing Congress to come up with more than $2 billion in new money to manage the flood of unaccompanied children arriving mostly in Texas.
Johnson referred to that supplemental funding. When a reporter asked how Congress would fund this when it was in recess, the secretary replied: “I believe there’s bipartisan support for this.”
He praised the efforts of the Border Patrol and other departments, saying they have done a “terrific job under trying circumstances.” He said the Department of Homeland Security and Department of Justice were moving resources from the interior to the border, including Border Patrol agents from other parts of the country.

NASA makes second attempt to launch CO2-measuring satellite,https://www.latimes.com/science/sciencenow/la-sci-sn-oco-launch-20140626-story.html,2014-06-30,"Five years after a launch malfunction destroyed its twin, NASA’s Orbiting Carbon Observatory-2 is slated to blast off from the California coast Tuesday, becoming the nation’s first satellite to exclusively monitor the greenhouse gas.
Themissionof the $465-million spacecraft is to measure and map carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere and provide scientists with a better understanding of how the Earth’s oceans, soils and forests absorb CO2, and whether that ability is changing.
“We really don’t have a lot of data right now to understand the uptake of carbon by these terrestrial ecosystems,” said OCO-2 science team member Paul Wennberg, a professor of atmospheric chemistry at the California Institute of Technology.
The satellite’s nickname, OCO, describes the composition of a carbon dioxode molecule -- two oxygen atoms flanking a single carbon atom in linear fashion.
The satellite’s launch is scheduled for 2:56 a.m. Tuesday at Vandenberg Air Force Base, near Buellton.
An earlier version of the satellite was lost on Feb. 24, 2009, when it failed to separate from the launch vehicle (an Orbital Taurus XL rocket) and burned up on reentry. The cost of that failed mission was $209 million, according to a mishapinvestigation.
OCO-2 is a near duplicate copy of the first satellite, but will be lifted into orbit on an entirely different platform -- a ULA (United Launch Alliance)Delta II 7320-10Crocket.
Carbon dioxide is a greenhouse gas that occurs both from natural processes, such as forest fires, and from human industrial activities, such as the burning of fossil fuels.
Like water vapor, C02 traps heat energy that would otherwise rise from the planet’s surface and escape into space, and researchers say CO2 concentrations today are the highest they’ve been in the last million years.
While many scientists say elevated CO2 concentrations are increasing the Earth’s average surface temperature, researchers have also observed that the planet itself has removed roughly half the man-made CO2 from the atmosphere.
“We don’t understand entirely what is the trend in the ability to take up CO2,” Wennberg said. “For example, do we expect that as the Arctic warms that the boreal forest, the high-latitude forest, will become a larger source or sink of carbon dioxide? These are the types of questions we are going to be addressing.”
The satellite will measure atmospheric CO2 with spectrometers, devices that divide light into its component wavelengths, or colors, the way a prism does.
As sunlight travels down through Earth’s atmosphere, bounces off its surface and then travels back up through the atmosphere toward space, CO2 molecules will absorb some of this light at specific wavelengths.
With the spectrometers, scientists will recognize CO2 molecules as a specific pattern of dark areas. The more intense these dark areas are, the more CO2 molecules there are.
“It measures the average amount of CO2 above a place on Earth, which is different from almost all other measurements of CO2, which are measurements in a small volume of air,” Wennberg said.

Crews try to keep fire in Sierra National Forest from crossing river,https://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-ln-california-firefighters-battle-wildfires-20140731-story.html,2014-07-31,"Firefighters have slowly begun to make progress against a growing 7,000-acre wildfire burning in the Sierra National Forest, officials reported Thursday.
The French fire, which started along the Rock Creek and Fish Creek campgrounds, is now 10% contained after burning largely out of control since it started Monday. Fire crews were working to maintain a fire line to keep flames from crossing the San Joaquin River, according to the U.S. Forest Service.
As firefighters made progress overnight, they continued to focus on building a defense around homes in Hogue Ranch and Kinsmans Flat.
On Thursday fire crews planned a backburning operation to strengthen their bulldozer and fire lines.
Poor air quality, meanwhile, remained a major concern as other wildfires continued to burn in the area.
Little progress was made overnight fighting the El Portal fire, which is burning near Old Portal and Foresta, National Park Service officials said Thursday.
The fire, which is 34% contained, started Saturday and has remained at 3,900 acres.
More than 1,000 fire personnel have been assigned to the blaze, which officials say has cost $4.4 million to fight.
The Dark Hole fire, four miles north of Yosemite Village, has scorched 724 acres and is just 5% contained, officials reported.
Lightning from thunderstorms in Northern California on Wednesday also ignited a series of fires in Siskiyou County.
Lightning also ignited 11 small fires in the Plumas National Forest area, but firefighters were able to quickly put most of them out.

Five killed in single-engine plane crash in Colorado,https://www.latimes.com/nation/nationnow/la-na-nn-five-dead-in-single-engine-crash-in-colorado-20140831-story.html,2014-09-01,"Five people were killed in a single-engine plane crash near Denver on Sunday, according to the National Transportation Safety Board.
The Piper PA-46 was making its final approach into Erie Municipal Airport when it crashed in a field north of the main runaway just before noon, said Peter Knudson, an NTSB spokesman.
The names of those killed in the crash have not been released, Knudson said.
Those on board were flying to Erie, Colo., from Centennial Airport, which is located in the suburbs south of Denver.
Knudson said NTSB investigators were at the scene and working with local officials to determine the cause of the crash. Only after the investigation is complete will the wreckage be moved, Knudson said.

Slaying probe uncovers reports of terrifying nighttime street pursuits,https://www.latimes.com/local/crime/la-me-0831-serial-killer-suspect-20140831-story.html,2014-08-31,"The young women were driving to a late-night party in Sylmar when one noticed a large sport utility vehicle on their tail.
They tried to lose the SUV, but it kept following. Terrified, the women drove to a San Fernando Valley police station to report the incident. The SUV drove away.
Detectives now believe the women were indeed being stalked — and, in fact, that the Aug. 10 incident marked the beginning of a 14-day stretch in which Los Angeles-area motorists were followed and sometimes shot at by a man police have labeled a serial killer. The string ended Aug. 24 in the San Fernando Valley when a shotgun-wielding man in an SUV killed three people and wounded four others.
Alex Hernandez, 34, has so far been charged with fatally shooting one person and trying to kill two others in the days before the Valley attacks. Detectives have identified him as the suspect in at least five other shootings, including the three Aug. 24.
As the police probe of Hernandez continues, investigators are reviewing accounts of people who say they were followed in recent weeks by a driver in a gold- or tan-colored SUV. In two cases, investigators suspect the killer was hunting potential victims.
In Sylmar, the mother of one of the women who was followed told The Times that her 22-year-old daughter felt sick over the news of the killings and the thought that her life may have been in danger.
“She’s shocked. We’re all shocked,” the woman, who declined to give her name, said. “My daughter said she felt like he wanted to harm them.”
The accounts of being chased echo those of motorists who were shot at, police said.
Nearly two weeks after the two women were pursued, Sylmar resident Adrian Gonzalez and his friend were driving to a late-night eatery near his home. Gonzalez told The Times that he noticed a large sport utility vehicle with its headlights turned off following close behind their car in the early-morning darkness.
The SUV began to shadow their every move, he said, then pulled up on their passenger side — its headlights suddenly on. The driver screamed at Gonzalez to lower the window, and at one point, asked: “Do you know what time it is, homie?”
The SUV driver had his right hand on the steering wheel and his left arm down, said Gonzalez, 24.
“I thought, ‘This guy is going to pull a gun.’ That’s when my friend floored it and we took off,” he said. “We started driving as fast as we could.”
After about 20 minutes, they were able to shake the SUV, Gonzalez said.
At the time, he hadn’t considered calling the cops. “We just followed our instincts: Let’s try to lose this guy,” he said.
Later that morning, Gonzalez walked outside and made a startling discovery. Across the street, Hernandez — his neighbor — was pulling into his driveway in his tan SUV. The vehicle looked like the SUV that had been following him and his friend that morning, and Hernandez’s attire matched that of the SUV’s driver, Gonzalez said.
“He was wearing the same hat and the same shirt,” Gonzalez said, adding that he also wore glasses.
Gonzalez said Hernandez had lived in the neighborhood just over a year and sometimes behaved oddly. He would often sit in his SUV, sometimes well into the early-morning hours, he said.
Gonzalez said he and his brother, Albert, 26, confronted Hernandez, who acknowledged that he had followed Gonzalez and his friend.
“He said he wanted to know where we were going and what we were up to,” Gonzalez said. “We told him that was no way of approaching people and that the reason we fled was because we thought the driver was going to kill us.”
Hernandez told them he wouldn’t do anything to harm them because they were his neighbors, the brothers said.
“He said, ‘Nah, man, I don’t play around and do that,’” Hernandez said, according to Albert Gonzalez. “If I’m going to pull it, you’re not even going to see it.”
On the morning of Aug. 24, Gonzalez said, he awoke to news of the three fatal shootings.
In a one-hour span, a gunman in an SUV had killed a 23-year-old woman going to church with her teenage siblings and her parents, a 29-year-old man apparently collecting recyclables and a 59-year-old woman also heading to church.
Gonzalez called police to report what had happened to him. By then, a police helicopter was hovering over their street. Then he spotted Hernandez, standing on top of his SUV — his arms spread wide, looking into the sky.
Hours later, SWAT officers descended on Hernandez’s house and arrested him.
Capt. William Hayes, the head of the LAPD’s Robbery-Homicide Division, said that following someone on a roadway isn’t a crime but that detectives are interested in using such reports to help develop a timeline for the killer’s actions.
Shootings from one car to another are not unheard of in Southern California’s vast and sometimes rage-fueled network of streets and freeways, and authorities did not connect the far-flung shootings until last week’s violence. Investigators are reviewing other unsolved shootings, including one in March.
Detectives said Hernandez is a suspect in an Aug. 14 shooting in Rosamond, north of Palmdale, in which the driver of a gold SUV rolled down his window and fired at least four shotgun blasts at a vehicle alongside him on the 14 Freeway. A passenger in the targeted car was severely wounded, authorities said.
Detectives said they also have connected Hernandez to the Aug. 20 shooting of a woman who was seriously wounded as she exited the 5 Freeway in Atwater Village.
Hernandez has been charged with the slaying of a 48-year-old man in Pacoima on Aug. 21 and the attempted murder of a couple who were unhurt when their car was blasted with a shotgun a day later in West Hollywood. The couple told sheriff’s investigators they saw a tan or gold SUV following them with its lights off at night before the vehicle eventually pulled alongside and the driver opened fire.
Hernandez has yet to enter a plea. He has also been charged with fatally shooting two dogs in a separate incident Aug. 23.

Lawmakers send Gov. Jerry Brown bill for more university funding,https://www.latimes.com/local/political/la-me-pc-california-university-funding-20140829-story.html,2014-08-30,"Reporting from Sacramento —When California lawmakers settled on a new state budget in June, they included triggers that would send more money to public universities if property tax revenue outpaced expectations.
The expectations weren’t met, but lawmakers are moving forward with additional funding anyway.
On Friday night, the Legislature approved $50 million each for the University of California and Cal State University systems. The money is intended for projects like overdue maintenance work.
State taxes have generated nearly $500 million more than expected -- a combination of money left over from the last fiscal year and strong receipts in July -- and supporters say there’s enough cash available to send more to universities.
But Gov. Jerry Brown’s administration opposes the bill, said H.D. Palmer, spokesman for the Department of Finance.
He said it’s too risky to dish out more money to universities when tax revenue could fluctuate over the next year. In addition, fighting wildfires during California’s drought could become increasingly expensive -- the state has already spent $159 million of its $204-million allocation.
“So in eight weeks, we’ve already burned through more than three-fourths of the amount that’s been budgeted for the entire year,” Palmer said. “And fire season is far from over.”
Assembly Speaker Toni Atkins (D-Sacramento), a primary proponent of the new funding, said she’d work to overcome Brown’s objections.
“I’ll do whatever lobbying I have to do to get it done,” she said.

Op-Ed: Congress should fund fires for what they are -- disasters,https://www.latimes.com/opinion/op-ed/la-oe-bosworth-fire-budget-20141001-story.html,2014-10-01,"Californians are all too familiar with the devastation forest fires bring. The state has already had more than 1,000 wildfires this year, and the worst of the fire season is just beginning. More than 350,000 acres of national forest have burned in Northern California so far in 2014. And each year recently, we’ve seen more and more acreage burn, and more homes and lives, as well as natural resources, put in jeopardy.
Not surprisingly, as wildfires have become more frequent and severe, the cost of battling them has also increased. In 1985, wildfire suppression cost the U.S. Forest Service about $240 million. In 2012, that number was $1.7 billion.
A lot of factors have contributed to the increase in fires — and the consequent increase in spending to suppress them — including a warming climate, drought and expanded development near fire-prone areas. But another reason for the growing number of fires has to do with the federal government’s refusal to adapt to the growing threat.
A massive forest fire is a natural disaster in the same way a hurricane or tornado is. But while the government seems to understand that you can’t budget for a hurricane, paying for the disaster out of a special emergency account funded specifically for that purpose, it still treats the cost of dealing with catastrophic fires as it does any other expenditure. An annual amount is budgeted to fight them, with little more than an estimate of what the fire season will actually bring.
This archaic method of funding fire suppression is wreaking havoc with Forest Service budgets, and it is also making it likely we’ll see more and costlier fires.
In recent years, we’ve seen the United States Forest Service have to transform itself into the “United States Fire Service.” Today, fire suppression accounts for more than half of the agency’s budget. And even then, Congress isn’t appropriating enough money to cover the true cost of battling fires, forcing the Forest Service to borrow from other, non-fire accounts.
This year, Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack announced that the Forest Service had run out of money for fire suppression at the end of August, meaning “fire borrowing” had to begin. For the rest of the year, other Forest Service projects will have to be halted or severely curtailed, as money appropriated to fund them is diverted to pay for fire suppression. This is no way to run an agency.
Moreover, the borrowing may be ensuring that fires become more dangerous and more costly. As the Forest Service siphons money from other accounts to pay for battling fires, it has to cut back on programs expressly aimed at reducing fire risk. Millions have been diverted from hazardous fuels reduction, forest health management and vegetation management, all of which is likely to mean bigger fires in the future.
Thankfully, a sensible solution to this problem exists in the Wildfire Disaster Funding Act. This proposed legislation would finally treat America’s most catastrophic wildfires in the way it treats other natural disasters, meaning that funds required to fight severe fires would be drawn from a federal emergency account rather than borrowed from other Forest Service programs. But Congress failed to take action on the bipartisan bill before it left for summer recess. For the sake of California’s future, it is time for Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Bakersfield) to put the Wildfire Disaster Funding Act on the House calendar.
The Wildfire Disaster Funding Act would allow hundreds of millions of dollars now diverted to fight fires to be restored to programs Congress intended to fund, including ones designed for wildfire prevention and forest health. That would in all likelihood result in fewer wildfires, healthier forests and better wildlife habitat. And, in the long term, it could save billions of federal dollars that are now, quite literally, going up in smoke.
Dale N. Bosworth served as chief of the United States Forest Service from 2001 to 2007. Jack Ward Thomas was chief from 1993 to 1996. Michael Dombeck was chief from 1997 to 2001.

"California burns through $209-million wildfire budget, taps $70 million more",https://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-ln-california-exhausts-budget-wildfires-20140930-story.html,2014-09-30,"California has burned through its wildfire-fighting budget -- $209 million -- just as it faces what is historically the worst of the fire season. And the state already has tapped into its reserves, pulling out $70 million more to combat drought-fueled blazes.
Although California routinely blows through its budget for fighting wildfires, this year the state set aside more money than usual. Now, less than three months after Gov. Jerry Brown signed the budget, his administrationis tapping into reservesintended as a cushion for unexpected costs like natural disasters.
Some of the costs of fighting state wildfires will be reimbursed by the federal government. But those funds are running low. Wildfires cost the U.S. about $125 billion annually. Earlier this month, state officials requested that Congress set up anemergency reserve, like California’s, to help pay for extreme fires.
The state has long been king when it comes to spending on wildfires. By one estimate, $4 billion was spent combating wildfires in California from 2003-12,topping all other states.
And the costs for fighting wildfires hasn’t abated in 2014, with blazes cropping up across the state’s forests, turned tinder dry amid prolonged drought conditions.
Federal forest land has alsotaken a huge hit, especially in Northern California, where a series of fires has scorched roughly 275,000 acres combined. The Happy Camp Complex alone -- which at 132,733 acres is California’s largest -- has cost the federal government $87.3 million to fight, or nearly half of the entire state budget for fighting wildfires.
State officials have called this wildfire season “unprecedented,” with parched landscapes primed to supercharge the rapid growth of relatively small fires.
The California Department of Fire and Forestry has responded to 4,974 fires from Jan. 1 to Sept. 20, which is 1,203 more than average, according to state statistics, which apply to non-U.S. Forest land.
Southern California, meanwhile, is only now entering the traditional start of its fall wildfire season, which is notorious for strong Santa Ana winds that have fanned destructive fires in the past.
“It’s already been a very active and very busy fire season,” Cal Fire spokesman Daniel Berlant told the Associated Press. “The Santa Ana and fall season just elevates that risk even more.”

"Light but steady rain falls in Southland, and a bigger storm is coming",https://www.latimes.com/local/california/la-me-rain-forecast-20141201-story.html,2014-12-01,"Mostly light but steady showers fell across a large swath of Southern California on Sunday, with the heaviest rain falling in mountain and coastal areas, causing mud and rock slides that forced the closure of a section of Pacific Coast Highway.
The stretch of PCH between Yerba Buena and Las Posas roads in southern Ventura County was shut down about 2:30 p.m., stranding some motorists and causing holiday weekend traffic tie-ups along the roadway, officials said. No injuries were reported, and officials said the highway might not reopen until Tuesday.
The Santa Monica Mountains area around the highway closure recorded the heaviest rain for the day, slightly over an inch, according to the National Weather Service. Most other areas in the region received half an inch of rain, while downtown Los Angeles recorded a mere 0.02 inches, leaving it with 0.50 for the rainfall season that began in July. In a normal year, the total would be 1.99 inches.
Periodic bursts of heavy rain in some areas, particularly in the San Fernando Valley, were unexpected.
“Especially in L.A. County, they were looking for lighter amounts, but there was just enough instability in the system to be surprised,” said Stuart Seto, a weather specialist with the National Weather Service. “That’s causing some problems and some ponding in the streets.”
The rain came on the same day that a Pacific storm walloped Northern California, where a number of flights had to be delayed or canceled at San Francisco International Airport because of low clouds and windy conditions, while heavy snowfall blanketed the Lake Tahoe area.
That storm is expected to hit the Southland with full force Tuesday, when as much as five inches of rain in the mountain areas and 1 to 2 inches in downtown Los Angeles are predicted. Scattered showers and cooler temperatures are expected to continue through Thursday. Residents in burn areas in Glendora and Azusa have been warned about possible flooding and mudslides.
“This is going to be a big event for us,” Seto said, comparing the upcoming rains to the drenching that Angelenos got on Halloween. Those rains measured about an inch, Seto said.
The storm is not expected to put much of a dent in California’s persistent drought, however.
“The drought that we’ve had has been in effect for three years,” said David Sweet, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service. “We don’t expect any one storm is going to be capable of making a change.”
Still, recent rain and cold weather have eased the wildfire dangers enough that state officials will officially declare the end of the fire season Monday for three Northern California counties.
Napa, Sonoma and Lake counties have a reduced risk of suffering a fast-moving wildfire and will exit the fire season. The fire season ended in Mendocino, Humboldt, Del Norte, Lassen and Modoc countieslast week, CalFire spokesman Daniel Berlant said.
“Because of the rain, fires are unlikely to become gigantic, huge wildfires,” Berlant said.
The designation changes little for CalFire or residents as a whole, Berlant said. Instead, the change influences mandatory precautions that agencies, such as a utility company, have to take when working in or around vegetation, Berlant said.
Though the weather has provided some relief for Northern California, the southern half of the state hasn’t been as fortunate.
“The fire season in Southern California never ended,” Berlant said. “Unless we get a substantial amount of rain in December, it’s unlikely that Southern California will transition out of fire season this year.”
So far in 2014, CalFire crews have fought more than 5,500 wildfires, about 1,000 more than normal.

"Amid a titillating scandal, Arroyo Grande gets a new mayor",https://www.latimes.com/local/california/la-me-arroyo-grande-20141201-story.html,2014-12-01,"Reporting from Arroyo Grande, Calif. —This town southeast of Pismo Beach has long been known for its wine-tasting rooms and quaint downtown. Being riven by political scandal is something new.
In last month’s election, a little known write-in candidate unseated Arroyo Grande’s longtime mayor amid a titillating scandal that pitted the city manager against an angry police union. In a short but powerful crusade, Jim Hill, a nuclear power plant engineer who campaigned just one day a week, defeated Mayor Tony Ferrara, who had held the seat since 2002.
Allegations of inappropriate trysts, cover-ups and favoritism at City Hall turned neighbor against neighbor, ushering in a new mayor whose first order of business will be helping the community of 17,000 heal.
“This is like a mini-Civil War, with brother fighting against brother,” said real estate broker Mike Byrd, a Hill campaign leader. “I have friends who are not speaking to me.”
Hill, 62, moved to Arroyo Grande from Oceano only three years ago and entered the race for mayor just six weeks before the Nov. 4 election. In a final ballot count completed Nov. 17, he won by 95 votes and is set to be sworn in Monday.
Discontented Arroyo Grande residents approached Hill, who had been elected twice to the Oceano Community Services District board, about challenging Ferrara after the local police union’s vote of no-confidence in the mayor and after City Council meetings became so contentious that law enforcement officers had to stand guard.
Political tensions here had been brewing over the usual small-town gripes: accusations of preferential business treatment and squabbles involving police contract negotiations. It all came to a head July 3.
City Manager Steve Adams and Community Development Director Teresa McClish had drinks together at a restaurant across the street from City Hall. They went to another restaurant and had more wine, Adams said later. McClish’s husband called the police when she didn’t arrive home by 11 p.m. and asked them to check for her car at City Hall.
At City Hall, officers found Adams, his hair disheveled and his shirt partly untucked. In their reports, the police said that he seemed angry when they asked about McClish. But when officers went into Adams’ office, they found McClish, partly dressed, “holding some sort of clothing to her chest,” according to a police report.
Mayor Ferrara, who defended Adams, later said the encounter was innocent and that the two had returned to City Hall to drink tea and sober up.
Adams and McClish did not return phone calls from The Times, but the city manager said in a statement published in a local newspaper that “nobody was at any time unclothed or partially unclothed.”
The city attorney’s office investigated the incident — city policy prohibits romantic relationships between supervisors and their subordinates — and Ferrara and the City Council reprimanded Adams for his “inappropriate” behavior. They warned Adams that he would be fired if he did it again. No action was taken against McClish.
The scandal played out as Arroyo Grande’s police union negotiated a new contract. Officers and some residents complained that Ferrara and the council had not taken stronger action against Adams. In September, the Arroyo Grande Police Officers Assn. took a vote of no-confidence against the mayor and city manager.
The union, which represents the department’s 28 officers, also questioned the objectivity of the city attorney’s investigation.
At one point, the City Council meetings became so contentious — with some calling for Adams to resign or be fired and others voicing their support for the council — deputies from the San Luis Obispo County Sheriff’s Department were called in to keep order.
Eventually, the council agreed to hire an outside firm to investigate.
That’s when Hill, an engineer at the Diablo Canyon nuclear power plant, entered the fray.
Hill said he decided to run because the officers were so incensed, they had put their livelihoods on the line.
“If the city employees were brave enough to risk their jobs by speaking out, then I could at least try to see if I could get elected,” said Hill, 62, who is married with three grown children.
But the campaign coincided with a major event at Diablo Canyon that required Hill to work 12-hour days six days a week, allowing him just one day each week to campaign.
Ferrara, 69, said the July 3 incident was “blown way out of proportion” and that he and Adams were casualties of divisive labor negotiations.
“My best assessment is this was a very well-orchestrated attack campaign and came from several sources with a mix of agendas,” said Ferrara, who served on the City Council for four years before becoming mayor. “Labor issues were alive and well here.”
In the end, an independent investigation conducted by Ventura-based Sintra Group could not find “substantive evidence” of a romantic relationship between Adams and McClish.
“However, their actions in going to City Hall later in the evening hours after consuming alcohol exhibited poor judgment,” the report stated.
On Nov. 19, the council accepted Adams’ resignation. A councilman also revealed that Adams had been reprimanded before the July 3 incident for a previous encounter with McClish.
Ferrara resigned last week, saying he didn’t want to be part of Hill’s swearing-in ceremony.
Hill, who won with 3,090 votes to Ferrara’s 2,995, said he knows his first task will be to reunify the town: “A number of people voted in good faith for the incumbent and others were deeply dissatisfied with several things. My job will be to bring everybody back together and move forward.”

Ferguson police to seek more black recruits; no severance for Darren Wilson,https://www.latimes.com/nation/nationnow/la-na-nn-ferguson-darren-wilson-20141130-story.html,2014-12-01,"Ferguson, Mo., will establish a civilian review board to monitor police conduct and will recruit more African American officers, the mayor announced Sunday.
But Mayor James Knowles III said there would be no imminent changes in the leadership of the police department in the wake of unrest after a grand jury declined to indict a white police officer who killed an unarmed black man.
Knowles spoke at a news conference a day after Darren Wilson, the officer who fatally shot Michael Brown on Aug. 9, resigned from the police force. Wilson did not receive severance pay, Knowles said.
Also Sunday, the White House announced that President Obama would hold several Ferguson-related events Monday. Obama will meet with his Cabinet to discuss federal programs and funding that provide equipment to state and local law enforcement agencies. Then he will meet with civil rights leaders and later with law enforcement officials and community and faith leaders “to discuss how communities and law enforcement can work together to build trust,” the White House said.
In Ferguson, the mayor said that adding a civilian review board and recruiting more African Americans would help improve the predominantly white police department’s relationship with Ferguson’s predominantly African American residents.
“We are committed to rebuilding our city,” Knowles said. “And a part of that is having officers invested in the community.”
In addition, Knowles said, the city will unveil a program in public schools that will aim to forge a bond between police officers and young people.
“We are here for you and will not leave you,” Knowles told residents.
For much of the last week, sometimes-violent protests have roiled the St. Louis suburb of about 21,000 after the grand jury’s decision.
When Wilson resigned Saturday, he said in a letter that he was told his “continued employment may put the residents and police officers of the city of Ferguson at risk.”
“It is my hope that my resignation will allow the community to heal,” Wilson wrote. “I would like to thank all of my supporters and fellow officers throughout this process.”
Wilson’s lawyer, Neil Bruntrager, said the officer had resigned after learning of threats of violence against other officers and the department.
Knowles said Sunday he was unaware of any specific threats to Wilson and did not give him a deadline for a resignation.
Ferguson Police Chief Tom Jackson said Sunday he would not resign, despite widespread criticism from protesters and calls for him to step down.
“My focus has been on safety and security of citizens,” Jackson said. “I report to the leadership of Ferguson. I’m concerned about the city. I will not resign.”
Jackson said he spoke with Wilson last week and was unaware of any specific threats to him. But Jackson added, “It’s been a threatening environment all along. Everybody knows that.”
Separately, Benjamin Crump, a lawyer representing Brown’s family, said Sunday that Wilson’s resignation was no surprise.
“The family will pursue all the legal avenues,” Crump told CBS’ “Face the Nation.” Crump said a wrongful-death lawsuit could be filed in the near future.
In addition, Crump said the Brown family would champion state and federal reforms that would require “every police officer” in “every American city” to don body cameras.
At the Ferguson news conference, Knowles said the city would do everything in its power to help the businesses that burned in the riots rebuild as soon as possible. As of now, he said, there is no cost estimate for the damaged property.
Missouri Gov. Jay Nixon has called a special legislative session so lawmakers can allocate state funds for the rebuilding efforts.
The U.S. Department of Justice is conducting a civil investigation into the Ferguson Police Department to see whether it has a pattern of using excessive force or racial profiling. The Justice Department is also conducting a criminal investigation of Wilson, but experts say a federal indictment is unlikely because the government would have to prove that Wilson purposely violated Brown’s civil rights.

Maryland governor to commute state’s last death sentences,https://www.latimes.com/nation/nationnow/la-na-nn-maryland-death-penalty-20141231-story.html,2014-12-31,"Maryland Gov. Martin O’Malley announced Wednesday he will commute the sentences of the four men who are currently on the state’s death row.
The move by O’Malley comes two years after state lawmakers passed legislation abolishing Maryland’s death penalty. However, that measure did not directly affect the inmates who were already on death row. There were five prisoners awaiting execution when the legislation took effect; one has died of natural causes.
“Recent appeals and the latest opinion on this matter by Maryland’s Attorney General have called into question the legality of carrying out earlier death sentences -- sentences imposed prior to abolition,” O’Malley said in a statement. “In fact, the Attorney General has opined that the carrying out of prior sentences is now illegal in the absence of an existing statute.”
O’Malley said he had spoken to the family members of the victims of the convicted murderers and that he felt his decision to commute the sentences to life in prison without parole was the right one.
“In my judgment, leaving these death sentences in place does not serve the public good of the people of Maryland -- present or future,” O’Malley said. “Gubernatorial inaction -- at this point in the legal process -- would, in my judgment, needlessly and callously subject survivors, and the people of Maryland, to the ordeal of an endless appeals process, with unpredictable twists and turns, and without any hope of finality or closure.”
Eighteen states do not have the death penalty, and since 2007, six -- Connecticut, Illinois, Maryland, New Jersey, New York and New Mexico -- have abolished it, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures.
O’Malley, who exits office next month after his second term, is exploring a potential run for the Democratic presidential nomination in 2016.

"Police officer deaths rise in 2014, with firearms the leading cause",https://www.latimes.com/nation/nationnow/la-na-nn-police-officer-deaths-nationwide-20141230-story.html,2014-12-31,"Nationwide, 126 law enforcement officers died in the line of duty in 2014, including 50 officers killed by firearms, according to an annual report released Tuesday.
The 2014 figures represent a jump from last year’s historically low tallies, when 102 officers died, including 32 by firearms, but remain below the previous decade’s average, according to the report from the National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial Fund.
On average, 166 officers died in the line of duty, including 57 killed by firearms, in the first decade of the millennium, said Craig W. Floyd, the fund’s chairman.
After firearm deaths, the second-leading cause of death in 2014 was traffic-related incidents, the report said, taking the lives of 49 officers.
California, the nation’s most populous state, led the country in officer fatalities with 14, according to the report. Texas saw 11 officers die in the line of duty, and New York had nine, which includes two officers assassinated as they sat in their squad car this month.
Floyd said he was alarmed by the 15 officer deaths that came as a result of ambushed attacks with a firearm, which matches 2012 as the most ambush attacks in a single year since 1995.
Floyd was particularly worried that more shooters could be inspired by high-profile killings including those motivated by anti-government or anti-police sentiment. He noted the ambush killing of two Las Vegas officers at a pizza shop in June; the September shooting of two Pennsylvania state troopers, one of whom died; and the slayinng of the two New York police officers Dec. 20.
“We are worried that the types of criminals the officers are having to confront are more brazen and cold-blooded than ever before,” he said.
Though police shootings jumped this year, they have been on the decline for decades, according to the report and law enforcement experts. The average number of officers shot and killed has decreased from 127 per year in the 1970s, to 87 in the 1980s, 68 in the 1990s, and 57 in the 2000s, according to the report.
The drop in deaths coincides with an increasing number of officers wearing soft-body armor, departments establishing specialized SWAT teams, and faster medical response times, said William Terrill, a criminal justice professor at Michigan State University.
Those advances have led to a small number of police deaths relative to the number of sworn officers in the country, which Terrill estimates at 800,000.
Terrill said he feared the uptick of shootings and ambushes in 2014 could further ingrain an “us versus them” mentality among some police officers. “Police officers will be more apt to be more suspicious of citizens and that may cause them to be more aggressive,” he said.
Terrill said that as officer deaths have been on the decline, shootings by police officers have been on the rise, according to data voluntarily submitted by local police agencies to the Federal Bureau of Investigation’s Uniform Crime Reporting Program.
There were 461 justifiable homicides by law enforcement officers in 2013, according to the data, up from the mid to high 300s during the 2000s. But the data are incomplete because departments volunteer the information, Terrill said, and the actual number of police shootings is likely much higher.
The report comes in a year where tensions have continued to grow in major cities between police and residents.
This month, New York police officers Rafael Ramos and Wenjian Liu were killed in an ambush by a man who threatened to avenge the killings of unarmed black men Michael Brown in Missouri and Eric Garner in New York. The gunman then killed himself, police said.

GOP lawmaker calls speaking to white supremacist group a mistake,https://www.latimes.com/nation/nationnow/la-pn-louisiana-rep-scalise-20141230-story.html,2014-12-31,"In an effort to quell growing criticism, a leading House Republican said Tuesday that he regretted speaking to a white supremacist group more than a decade ago.
“It was a mistake I regret, and I emphatically oppose the divisive racial and religious views groups like these hold,” Rep. Steve Scalise of Louisiana said in a statement.
Scalise, the House majority whip, issued the statement after reports surfaced over the weekend that he spoke at a 2002 convention of the European American Unity and Rights Organization when he was a Louisiana state lawmaker.
The organization, founded by former Ku Klux Klan leader David Duke, is viewed as a hate group by civil rights organizations such as the National Assn. for the Advancement of Colored People and the Southern Poverty Law Center. Duke founded EURO two years before Scalise addressed the group’s convention.
“As a Catholic, these groups hold views that are vehemently opposed to my own personal faith, and I reject that kind of hateful bigotry,” Scalise said.
House Speaker John A. Boehner (R-Ohio) said he stood behind Scalise, calling him a “man of high integrity” who made an error in judgment and acknowledged it. Scalise “has my full confidence” in his leadership position as majority whip, Boehner said.
Scalise also received votes of confidence from the No. 2 Republican in the House, Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy of Bakersfield; Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal; and Rep. Cedric L. Richmond, who will be Louisiana’s only Democrat in the new Congress. Richmond, who is black, told NOLA.com: “I don’t think Steve Scalise has a racist bone in his body.”
A spokesman for House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-San Francisco) used the news about Scalise’s speech to castigate Republicans, who control the House, for not passing a comprehensive immigration bill this year and for their decision not to restore portions of the Voting Rights Act that were struck down by the Supreme Court.
Pelosi spokesman Drew Hammill said Scalise’s “involvement with a group classified by the Anti-Defamation League as anti-Semitic and the Southern Poverty Law Center as a hate group is deeply troubling for a top Republican leader in the House.”
Mark Potok, editor of the Southern Poverty Law Center’s quarterly journal, wrote, “Scalise, a politician who already had national aspirations at the time of the 2002 EURO conference, certainly should have known what his dalliance with open white supremacists might cost him.”

"Giant tunnels planned for delta ‘must move forward,’ Brown says",https://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-ln-brown-delta-plan-20150430-story.html,2015-05-01,"Reporting from Oakland —As the hub of California’s sprawling water system, the Sacramento-San Joaquin delta has been the focus of the state’s water fights for decades.
Competing interests — environmental, urban and agricultural — have defeated repeated efforts to come up with a “delta fix” that would keep copious amounts of water flowing south to the sun-drenched croplands of the San Joaquin Valley and millions of homes in Southern California.
Gov. Jerry Brown’s announcement Thursday that the state is scaling back part of a long-planned project to restore more than 100,000 acres of fish and wildlife habitat and re-engineer the delta was a sign of how elusive that fix remains.
Accompanied by top federal and state environmental officials at a news conference, Brown offered remarks that amounted to funeral rites for the Bay Delta Conservation Plan.
Delta water exporters had hoped the program would yield a 50-year, federal environmental permit insulating them from continued cuts to their deliveries.
The state is still proposing to build a new diversion point on the Sacramento River in the north delta. It would feed two proposed 30-mile tunnels that would carry water to existing delta pumps and southbound aqueducts.
But in the face of continuing resistance from the federal fishery agencies that must approve the project, the state will now seek short-term permits that could grow stricter as delta conditions evolve with climate change.
State officials said they are also dropping plans to spend $8 billion in federal and state money to restore more than 100,000 acres of fish and wildlife habitat over the next five decades. Instead they are settling for a more modest — but, they said, more realistic — effort to improve 30,000 acres of habitat over the next four or five years at a cost of $300 million, funded with state bond money and other sources.
“This is an imperative. It must move forward,” Brown said of the project. “This is not just some piece of rhetoric … this is a serious effort on the part of the federal authorities, state authorities.”
Without a 50-year guarantee of water supplies, it remains to be seen if the agricultural and urban water contractors who have committed to picking up the $15-billion tab for tunnel construction will persevere.
In statements, several major agencies, including the Metropolitan Water District of Southern California, said they were reserving judgment until they could study details of the new plans, which will be formally released in June in the form of revised environmental documents.
But they acknowledged that it was time to throw in the towel on the conservation plan. “Continuing along the previous pathway toward approval of the Bay Delta Conservation Plan has resulted in repeated obstacles and was not acceptable,” said Dan Nelson, executive director of the San Luis & Delta-Mendota Water Authority, which represents some San Joaquin Valley irrigation districts. “The danger of a collapsing delta ecosystem and a faltering economy were too real to allow the previous efforts to drag on.”
Brown said the contractors “have no choice” but to stick with the project. “If they don’t do this, they are absolutely certain to suffer serious [water] losses in the future,” he argued.
The drought has heightened delta conflicts as growers have complained that endangered species protections have restricted delta pumping during the few storms that hit the state last winter. Environmentalists, meanwhile, have lamented that the drought is pushing some delta fish species ever closer to extinction.
Part of the largest estuary on the West Coast, the delta has been a bottleneck for decades in California’s complex water system, which revolves around transferring supplies from the water-rich north to the semi-arid, populated south.
The delta’s environmental troubles started in the 1800s, when Gold Rush-era settlers drained its wildlife-rich wetlands and turned them into cropland. As the state’s big government water projects came on line in the 20th century, more and more water was diverted from delta tributaries and the delta itself. Now freshwater flows through the delta to the sea are only about half what they once were.
The federal and state pumping operations in the south delta that fill the big aqueducts headed south have profoundly altered the delta’s hydrology, disturbing the salinity patterns with which native fish evolved. The pumps pull migrating salmon and the tiny delta smelt to their deaths and cause some delta water channels to flow backwards.
That has helped send fish populations plummeting and triggered increasingly strict endangered species protections that have tightened the spigot on delta pumping.
The premise of the conservation plan was that a new diversion system and extensive habitat restoration would improve delta conditions, boost the populations of imperiled fish and ease limits on exports.
But the project, in the planning stages for nearly nine years, has encountered delays and heated opposition from delta growers and some environmentalists who argue the tunnels will inevitably become a vehicle to take more water from the delta’s failing ecosystem.
“This plan has now shifted from a proposal to protect 56 species and over 100,000 acres of habitat to a straight water grab,” said Barbara Barrigan-Parrilla, executive director of Restore the Delta, a delta group and one of the project’s most vocal critics.
Federal fishery agencies have also been skeptical that the habitat work would be beneficial for fish species that are suffering from a multitude of problems, most notably the lack of adequate freshwater flows through the delta.
“This is a huge deal for the governor of California to recognize the need for adjustment” to the project, said William Stelle Jr., West Coast regional administrator for the National Marine Fisheries Service, one of the agencies that has to sign off on the tunnels.

Gov. Jerry Brown set to unveil scaled-back delta conservation plan,https://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-ln-brown-tunnels-20150429-story.html,2015-04-30,"Gov. Jerry Brown is expected to announce Thursday that the state is substantially trimming the amount of fish and wildlife habitat it plans to restore in connection with a controversial project to replumb the heart of California’s water system.
This month, state water officials said they were overhauling a proposal to construct two massive water tunnels under the Sacramento-San Joaquin River Delta and restore more than 100,000 acres of delta habitat.
Among the changes that Brown is expected to detail at an Oakland news conference is the decision to move ahead with just 30,000 acres of habitat work in the next 3.5 years.
“It represents a shift from the aspirational ... to something that is more realistic and has actual dollars behind it,” Carl Wilcox, delta policy advisor to the director of the state Department of Fish and Wildlife, said Wednesday.
The acreage of the revised project was reported earlier by the Associated Press.
Funding would come from last year’s water bond and other sources. The restoration effort would also be separated from the tunnel construction as the state changes its permitting approach for the project, known as the Bay Delta Conservation Plan.
Years in the making, the plan is designed to lessen the environmental harm of delta water exports by building a new diversion point on the Sacramento River that would feed two 30-mile tunnels connected to existing pumping facilities that send supplies south to San Joaquin Valley growers and Southland cities.
The project also called for restoring 100,000 acres or more of habitat over five decades at a cost of $8 billion in federal and state funds.
A major goal of the plan was to gain a 50-year environmental permit for delta exports that would ease the endangered species restrictions that have cut delta deliveries.
But state water resources Director Mark Cowin this month said it had become apparent that the project couldn’t meet the tough federal requirements for such long-term approvals.
So the state is shrinking the scope of the project. It will pursue shorter permits, split off the habitat work and focus on restoring 30,000 acres of wetland and tidal habitat at a much smaller cost. Some of the habitat work is required under existing permits and is overdue.
The water contractors who have committed to paying the $15-billion construction bill for the tunnels have argued that improving habitat is bound to boost populations of imperiled delta smelt and migrating salmon.
But the federal fishery agencies that have to approve the project have expressed doubts that the restoration would be that beneficial for species that are suffering from a host of problems, including a loss of half the fresh water that once flowed through the delta out to sea.
Delta farmers, who staunchly oppose the tunnels, also worry that they would lose tens of thousands of acres of cropland to the restoration program.
A shorter permit could make the project less attractive to the water contractors, who saw a 50-year permit as protection from continuing cuts in delta deliveries.
“We don’t really know what the permitting will be 10 years from now, 15 years from now,” Jeffrey Kightlinger, general manager of the Metropolitan Water District of Southern California, said this month. “That’s the challenge in making sure it’s a sound investment. Does it pencil out and still make sense?”

"Imperiled bird, the greater sage grouse, is key to land preservation plan",https://www.latimes.com/nation/la-na-nn-feds-protect-greater-sage-grouse-20150528-story.html,2015-05-30,"The greater sage grouse once numbered into the millions, but its population has shrunk to no more than hundreds of thousands as human developments have expanded across 10 western states.
Now, the fate of the imperiled bird, is at the center of a battle over to how to manage sagebrush lands that have long been the symbol of the West.
The Obama administration this week announced its latest proposals to protect the grouse by limiting some development and restricting some types of drilling for oil or gas on the lands run by the U.S. Bureau of Land Management and the U.S. Forest Service.
At the heart of the battle is a court-ordered deadline of Sept. 30 for the federal government to decide whether the sage grouse needs protection under the Endangered Species Act.
That designation could limit energy-related development even more than the administration proposals.
At stake is the Sagebrush Sea, millions of acres of grasslands across California, Colorado, Idaho, Montana, Nevada, North Dakota, Oregon, South Dakota, Utah and Wyoming.
More than two dozen varieties of the grasses grow in the region, home to more than 300 animal and bird species, including the sage grouse.
It is a region under stress.
“The West is rapidly changing — with increasingly intense wildfires, invasive species and development altering the sagebrush landscape and threatening wildlife, ranching and our outdoor heritage,” said Interior Secretary Sally Jewell. “As land managers of two-thirds of greater sage grouse habitat, we have a responsibility to take action that ensures a bright future for wildlife and a thriving Western economy.
“Together with conservation efforts from states and private landowners, we are laying an important foundation to save the disappearing sagebrush landscape of the American West,” she said as she unveiled the proposals Thursday at the Hereford Ranch east of Cheyenne, Wyo.
Jewell tried to minimize the expected complaints from environmental groups seeking tougher regulations and from energy producers seeking to ease restrictions.
The plans “have strong conservation efforts, but they also allow sustainable development and traditional uses of the land,” Jewell said. “And they respect the existing rights that exist on these lands.”
Environmental groups were cautious, with some urging more stringent protections.
“This planning process definitely has the potential of finally conserving a quintessential American species and landscape, but half-measures won’t cut it,” Jamie Rappaport Clark, president and chief executive of the Defenders of Wildlife, said in a prepared statement.
Erik Molvar, a wildlife biologist with WildEarth Guardians, said the proposals were not strong enough.
“The Interior secretary went to a part of Wyoming where the sage grouse has been extinct for decades to circle her wagons around a crippled Wyoming plan,” he said.
He argued that the federal plan would allow more energy-related development.
Energy groups also were unhappy with the federal proposals.
“Conservation of the sage grouse is a goal shared by the oil and natural gas industry, ranchers, other industries, states and communities across the West,” said Kathleen Sgamma, vice president of government and public affairs at Western Energy Alliance, a trade group that represents 450 energy-related companies. “That goal is best achieved at the state level, not with a one-size-fits-all federal approach.”
Some Republicans in Congress criticized the plans as the federal government reaching too far.
“This is just flat out wrong,” Rep. Rob Bishop of Utah, chairman of the House Natural Resources Committee, said in a statement. “If the Administration really cares about the bird they will adopt the state plans as they originally said they would. The state plans work. This proposal is only about controlling land, not saving the bird.”

"Woman gives birth, fights off bees, starts wildfire in Northern California",https://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-ln-woman-lost-forest-20150630-story.html,2015-06-30,"A woman fought off bees, started a fire and survived on apples -- all after giving birth in a lonely stretch of Northern California forest, she told a Bay Area TV station.
The woman, Amber Pangborn, 35, of Oroville, made a hasty decision to take an unfamiliar shortcut while driving to her parents’ house after going into labor Thursday.
Instead, she got lost.
“I thought we were going to die,” she told KCRA-TV. “And there was no cell service, there was no ... there was nothing.”
But Pangborn’s baby wouldn’t wait and she had no choice but to give birth alone. She named her daughter Marisa.
And then came the bees and mosquitoes.
“I tried to not get them to sting her,” Pangborn told KCRA. The bees wanted the placenta, she said with a chuckle. She was stung while defending her daughter, she said.
By Saturday, Pangborn’s desperation reached a fever pitch.
“I was just there at the end, thinking, ‘Oh my God.” I wasn’t sure if we were going to actually get out of there,” she said.
Pangborn started a fire in a desperate attempt to summon help, but the flames quickly grew out of control.
“Like, the whole side of the mountain caught on fire. I was looking at Marisa and was like, ‘I think Mommy just started a forest fire,’” she said.
But the tactic worked, and Pangborn was spotted by investigators.
“I was crying, I was so happy, I thought we were gonna die,” she said. “I’m so glad someone had finally seen us.”
Mother and baby were rescued Saturday after U.S. Forest Service officials said they received a report of low-lying smoke in the forest.
A Forest Service fire engine and helicopter were sent to the area. There they found Pangborn and her newborn inside the vehicle.
“We did recognize they both needed immediate attention,” agency spokesman Jeremy Croft said.
Firefighters quickly removed them from the path of the quarter-acre fire. The fire is under investigation, officials said in a statement.
“Our thoughts and best wishes continue to be with the mother and baby,” Forest Service supervisor Chris French said. “We are very pleased with the professionalism and cool-headed decision-making of our fire response crew.”
French said his office could not confirm Pangborn’s story because officials were not present for the birth.
Butte County Sheriff’s Office officials said they did not respond to the call.
Pangborn was treated at an Oroville hospital and has been released, a hospital official said.
The baby was taken to UC Davis Medical Center, where she is in good condition, hospital spokeswoman Phyllis Brown said.
Pangborn’s mother, Dianna Williams, told the L.A. Times that her nine-months-pregnant daughter went to a casino on Wednesday to visit a friend and get a respite from the hot temperatures. Pangborn, she said, was also hoping to induce labor.
After visiting the casino, she decided to head home, but she turned on the wrong road and ran out of gas, her mother said. She was forced to give birth to her baby in the forest.
“They would have never found her if she didn’t start the fire,” her mother said. “She was worried what the wild animals would do.”
When Pangborn didn’t return home, Williams logged onto Facebook and urged anyone with details about her whereabouts to immediately notify her.
Pangborn, who has three other daughters, is looking forward to being reunited with her new baby, Williams said. Because Pangborn had gastric bypass surgery years ago, she said the baby was premature and needs additional care. But Williams said the baby is “doing great” and is “getting better.”
Pangborn could not immediately be reached for comment. Williams said Pangborn is staying with her father and was overwhelmed by the media attention her story has received.
In May, Pangborn described the pains of pregnancy on Facebook.
“Oh man being pregnant at 35 years is a lot rougher than 25 years but get to appreciate it at different times in my life and I know I will miss it even though right now I am getting tired of being pregnant and sharing my body with another human being,” she wrote.
Even though she experienced some difficulty, she said pregnancy was a blessing.
“I wouldn’t trade it for anything in the world and I am blessed that I get this opportunity cause some women aren’t so lucky,” she wrote.

Man allegedly impersonating a firefighter is arrested near Lake fire,https://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-ln-man-impersonating-firefighter-arrested-20150630-story.html,2015-06-30,"A 44-year-old man impersonating a firefighter has been arrested after he claimed to be looking for a fire crew battling the Lake fire in the San Bernardino National Forest, authorities said Tuesday.
David Anthony Battle was arrested Saturday at the Lake fire incident command center, where firefighters gather to share information about the blaze and distribute equipment, according to the San Bernardino County Sheriff’s Department.
It is unclear whether Battle was trying to join firefighters to battle the blaze or attempting to burglarize the area, sheriff’s spokeswoman Tiffany Swantek said.
The San Bernardino resident was first spotted about 5 p.m. by deputies who were patrolling the area surrounding the fire, as well as evacuated neighborhoods.
He drove a white Crown Victoria -- a vehicle typically used by fire officials -- into the restricted area when he was stopped at a checkpoint and told deputies he was a firefighter, officials said.
Donning an authorized fire department uniform, Battle said he was trying to find his fire crew and then left the area, officials said.
About 15 minutes later, deputies found Battle and the car at the fire’s incident command post at Big Bear High School.
Battle couldn’t provide proper fire department identification, sheriff’s officials said.
After deputies checked Department of Motor Vehicles records, they determined the car was reported stolen from the city of San Bernardino two weeks ago.
Inside the vehicle, deputies found uniforms from different fire agencies, a stolen radio from the Lake fire incident and a stolen handgun.
Battle, who was on probation for grand theft auto, was immediately taken into custody on suspicion of possessing stolen property, sheriff’s officials said.
Criminal records show Battle has been convicted several times for receiving stolen property. From 1989 to 1993, he served time in correctional facilities in North Carolina for theft, burglary, receiving a stolen vehicle and forging checks.
Meanwhile, firefighters are continuing to battle the 31,359-acre wildfire, which is 60% contained. The cause of the fire remains under investigation. The price tag for fighting the Lake fire so far has reached $32.5 million.
Anyone who may have seen Battle in the area or the stolen vehicle is asked to call Det. Jim Wijnhamer at (909) 866-0100, Det. Lance Stuart at (909) 890-4840 or Cal Fire Capt. Jack Markle at (909) 881-6922.

Washington wildfire destroys dozens of homes; fireworks are banned nearby,https://www.latimes.com/nation/nationnow/la-na-nn-washington-wildfires-20150630-htmlstory.html,2015-06-30,"Fed by winds, high temperatures and industrial chemicals, the Sleepy Hollow fire in eastern Washington had burned nearly 3,000 acres and burned nearly 30 homes and several industrial buildings as of Wednesday evening.
The blaze started Sunday outside Wenatchee, about 150 miles east of Seattle, and had grown dramatically by the end of the day after embers blew on top of a recycling plant and several warehouses that contained chemicals, officials said. As of Wednesday evening, the blaze was 47% contained.
The damage to dozens of buildings has left residents heartbroken, even if their own homes had been spared.
""It's a mix of emotions -- blessed and guilty,"" said Desiree Schmidt, seated under a tent near a home that had burned to the ground. ""I can go to my refrigerator and shower. We have 28 friends and neighbors who can't.""
Kay Mckellar, a spokeswoman for the Chelan County Fire District, said investigators had yet to determine a cause. A spokesman for the Chelan County Sheriff’s Department said Wednesday morning that investigators have ruled out natural causes. There were no lightning strikes outside Wenatchee when the fire started Sunday.
”More than likely, it’s a human cause,” said Rich Magnussen of the sheriff’s office. “It’s still a very active investigation at this point.”

Forest Service fire fighters from Leavenworth watch as a house burns in northern Wenatchee, Wash., on June 28, 2015. A wildfire fueled by high temperatures and strong winds roared into a central Washington neighborhood, destroying properties and forcing residents of several hundred homes to flee, authorities said Monday.

The initial blaze, which began outside the town of Monitor, Wash., created a second and more powerful fire when embers blew onto the roof of a recycling plant in Wenatchee, Mckellar said. The fire quickly spread to a pair of nearby fruit-packing warehouses and another building that housed a large amount of paper, Mckellar said.
The fruit-packing warehouses contained drums of ammonia, according to Mckellar, who said the fire quickly gained intensity Sunday.
""It all just went boom, boom, boom,"" she said.
Mckellar said another building was part of an orchard supply business, and contained fertilizers and other agricultural chemicals. Among those chemicals was methyl bromide, KING-TV reported, a highly toxic chemical commonly used in pesticides that can cause irritation to the lungs and eyes and neurological effects.
Officials told reporters Wednesday that a cleanup effort was underway, and that crews had dumped a large amount of sand around the area to help contain the spill.
The fire has destroyed nearly 30 homes in Wenatchee, plus several industrial structures. The damage to the warehouses also caused an ammonia leak Monday, prompting city officials to issue a shelter-in-place order while the chemical spill was contained, Mckellar said.
No one had been hurt as of Tuesday morning, Mckellar said. At least 1,000 people who live near the fire had been ordered to evacuate the area. Not all of them complied, but 155 people checked into a nearby Red Cross shelter Sunday.
By Wednesday morning, all mandatory evacuations had been lifted in the area, but residents were told to remain alert.

Behind the wreckage of Cindy Dominguez's home stood a clean, white statue of St. Francis, shrouded by blackened trees. The statue was one of the only things she owned that survived the fire.
A charred swing stood where a porch used to be. The house burned down around the metal box that formed Dominguez's fireplace. It remains, scorched and lonely in the rubble.
""It's devastating and heartbreaking all at once,"" Dominguez said as she sipped a bottle of water and surveyed the damage. ""I have to find my wedding ring. I had it in a drawer. I should have had it in the fire lockbox. It was the only thing that would withstand the fire, and we took it with us. Duh.""
By Wednesday morning, firefighters had managed 47% containment of the blaze, up from 10% the day before.
Strong winds from the west and high temperatures helped drive the fire Sunday, and forecasts indicate the mercury could stay above triple digits for the rest of the week.According to the National Weather Service, temperatures around Wenatchee could reach a high of 103 degrees Thursday, and highs are expected to top 100 degrees Friday and Saturday.
Despite the troublesome weather, Wenatchee's 31,000 residents were ""no longer in imminent danger"" on Tuesday afternoon, according to Joe Anderson, a spokesman for the U.S. Forest Service. He said the fire was unlikely to advance any further.
With their eye on the hazardous fire conditions, officials have banned fireworks and open burns in Chelan and Douglas counties.
Although it’s still legal for residents to buy fireworks at local stands, Wenatchee Mayor Frank Kuntz said, authorities will be out in force during the holiday to crack down.
”We don’t want to have any careless activities causing additional fires for us,” said Chelan County Fire Chief Mike Burnett, adding that firefighters, many of them volunteers, are exhausted after working around the clock to battle the fire. “Just give us a break, please.”

Families of Yarnell Hill firefighters settle legal claims with state,https://www.latimes.com/nation/la-na-ff-yarnell-fire-settlement-20150629-story.html,2015-06-30,"Flag-topped shovels with the names of the Granite Mountain Hotshots on their blades were a grim reminder of the tragedy that occurred two years ago as residents gathered June 28 for the Remembrance Event of the 2nd anniversary of the Yarnell Hill Fire in Arizona. Nineteen firefighters died on June 30, 2013, when the men were overrun by flames in a brush-choked canyon.
Reporting from Tucson —The families of 12 men killed in one of the deadliest wildfires in the nation’s history have reached a settlement with the state of Arizona, ending a strained yearlong negotiation that divided the town of Prescott and raised questions about training and how the state fights fires.
The families of 12 of the 19 Granite Mountain Interagency Hotshot Crew members settled for $50,000 each, according to a copy of the settlement agreement. The agreement was announced Monday, one day before the second anniversary of the deaths.
A workplace lawsuit also announced Monday will ensure the families of the other seven firefighters killed on June 28, 2013, will receive $10,000 each from the Arizona State Forestry Division.
In addition to the financial settlements, the Forestry Division also agreed to make improvements in how it manages fires, including overhauling its radio communication efforts.
The Forestry Division also pledged to encourage the National Wildfire Coordination Group, a federal interagency firefighting group, to create a course that addresses “the reality of death,” and instructs firefighters to make estate planning and custody arrangements.
Roxanne Warneke visited Yarnell Hill, where her husband, Billy, and his crew were overtaken by a quick-turning brush fire. The visit was troubling, Warneke said, because her husband would not have chosen to descend into a deep, brush-filled valley unless he was ordered to.
“Descending into that canyon went against everything he was taught,” Warneke said at a televised news conference on Monday in Phoenix. “After that day, I knew I needed answers.”
A common complaint from families of the dead Hotshots was that state officials did not fully explain what caused the tragedy and whether it could have been avoided. The Forestry Division agreed that when all litigation concludes, including appeals, it will have an eight-hour meeting with the families and consultants to review information about the fire and answer questions, with lawyers present.
In 2013 a report prepared by local, state and federal investigators said that several factors contributed to the tragedy, such as wind, terrain and the firefighters’ movements. It did not pinpoint one factor as the leading cause of the deaths. It pointed out management lapses but found no evidence of recklessness or negligence.
That same year, the Arizona Division of Occupational Safety and Health leveled two citations against the Forestry Division, proposing more than $500,000 in fines for failing to provide a safe work environment by ignoring changing weather patterns and fire behavior.
The Forestry Division specified in the settlement that it was not admitting to either citation and refuted all allegations of wrongdoing.
Administrative Law Judge Michael Mosesso approved the settlement on Thursday. The settlement was another victory to the families of the firefighters killed on duty, following a decision by the city of Prescott’s retirement board last year to award enhanced benefits to the families of the 12 members of the Granite Mountain Hotshots who worked on a seasonal basis, and were initially denied the benefits accorded to full-time employees.
Arizona Atty. Gen. Mark Brnovich was adamant Monday that the state admitted no fault, but said the settlement fixed a problem without assigning blame.
“We don’t measure our success in wins and losses. We are not State Farm, we are the state of Arizona,” Brnovich said. “Some folks look for answers, some look for fights. We wanted to look for answers.”
Attorney Patrick McGroder, who represented the families in their suit against the state, called the negotiations “grueling,” and the years leading up to the settlement wore on family members of the firefighters, especially the 12 who were originally classified as seasonal workers.
Almost immediately after the fire, in August 2013, Prescott Mayor Marlin Kuykendall told the Daily Courier in a meeting meant to explain the city’s position that the families of the firefighters originally considered seasonal workers were after money.
“She’s a neat little lady ... but money took hold in this situation real fast,” Kuykendall said about Juliann Ashcraft, wife of crew member Andrew Ashcraft. “This is big bucks when it’s all over, big bucks. And money seems to be leading some of the battle over the city’s participation.”
McGroder on Monday said the settlement would help ensure fewer firefighters die in the future.
“For the families, I hope this settlement can achieve a modicum of peace,” McGroder said. “Through this settlement, the legacy of their loved ones will never be forgotten.”

300-acre wildfire in Lompoc threatens historic mission; evacuations ordered,https://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-ln-wildfire-lompoc-prompts-evacuations-20150629-story.html,2015-06-30,"About 1,200 residents were ordered to evacuate Monday as a fast-moving 300-acre fire in Lompoc moved dangerously close to homes and a Spanish mission, officials said. As of 6 p.m., the fire was 55% contained.
The wildfire started just after 1 p.m. off Burton Mesa Boulevard and was surging toward Cebada Canyon, said Capt. Dave Zaniboni of the Santa Barbara County Fire Department.
Because of dry vegetation the area was at high risk, so deputies ordered approximately 1,200 residents in Cebada Canyon, Gypsy Canyon and Tularosa Road to immediately evacuate, the Santa Barbara County Sheriff’s Office said. Residents in the Mission Hills area were told to prepare to evacuate.
Workers toldKSBY-TV that La Purisima Missionwas also ordered to evacuate.
Founded in 1787, the mission once covered 470 square miles and was home to Chumash and Spanish settlers. More than 200,000 people visit the mission every year.
A strike team was positioned at the mission ready to protect it from flames, Zaniboni said.
The California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection was responding to the blaze to provide assistance.
According to the National Weather Service, winds could reach 15 mph in Lompoc.
The winds, however, are proving to be less of factor in the fire. Dry, dense brush, including oak trees and chaparral, was fanning the fire, Zaniboni said.

How Black Lives Matter forced campaigns to toss their strategies on black voters,https://www.latimes.com/nation/la-na-campaign-black-lives-20150731-story.html,2015-07-31,"Patrisse Cullors speaks at a rally last year calling for civilian oversight of a proposed rebuilding of Men’s Central Jail in Los Angeles.
Reporting from Fort Lauderdale, Fla. —Democrats have never been more confident that their chances of hanging onto the White House hinge on black voters, who helped tip key states toward President Obama — but they have never been less confident, it seems, about how to talk to them.
The Black Lives Matter campaign is seeing to it that the rules they relied on for courting the vote no longer apply.
The potent social media-driven movement, sparked in the aftermath of Florida teen Trayvon Martin’s 2012 shooting death and reignited in the racial unrest in response to the deaths of other unarmed African Americans at the hands of police over the last year, has 2016 contenders scrambling to adjust their strategies. The protesters involved are proving masterful at refocusing the spotlight.
Candidates who might otherwise have been complacent, given their high marks on legislative report cards from the National Assn. for the Advancement of Colored People and endorsements from an older generation of black leaders, have had to more directly confront uncomfortable questions of racial inequality and the mistreatment of blacks by the criminal justice system.
“We want to ensure that these candidates will actually deal with the issues that black people face,” said Patrisse Cullors, a movement cofounder from Los Angeles. “The reality is that it’s still not legal to be black in this country.”
The group’s demands weighed heavily on discussions Friday at a major conference of the National Urban League in Fort Lauderdale, where candidates of both parties sparred over the best approach for improving the lives of African Americans. Democrat Hillary Rodham Clinton dived deep into the challenges of being black in America and the structural racism embedded in the country’s culture and economy. Jeb Bush, a Florida Republican, tried to relate his conservative growth agenda to minority empowerment.
Both heavyweights had found themselves pushed off balance by Black Lives Matter before the conference.
The movement inserted itself into the race through a few well-timed and highly publicized confrontations with candidates — several of which exposed politicians’ tone-deafness on racial issues. Often it was through a simple impromptu action, during which activists would demand that candidates repeat the words “Black lives matter.”
Many candidates flubbed it. Their frequent response that “all lives matter” was perceived by many blacks as a refusal to acknowledge the particular risks faced by those with black skin. Republicans generally pushed back, accusing the activists of stoking racial division.
Bush emphasized to the Urban League convention that his economic plan would prove beneficial to urban communities.
“Four percent growth is more enterprise in urban areas, more people moving in, a higher tax base and more revenues — in other words, a better chance to save our cities,” Bush said. “We can do this as a country. We can grow at a pace that lifts up everybody, and there is no excuse for not trying.”
Democrats, in contrast, are aggressively positioning themselves as empathetic to the outrage into which Black Lives Matter has tapped.
They are reeducating themselves on how to talk to black voters. They are sending surrogates to meet with activists, shifting their rhetoric and — in some cases — issuing apologies. They fear more stumbles could erode the bloc of black voters that was key to Obama’s victories in Florida, Virginia, Ohio and Pennsylvania.
“This is not just about statistics, as damning as they can be,” Clinton said at the Urban League event. “This is about Americans doing some soul-searching and holding ourselves to account.”
Cullors says the group wants candidates to address poverty, racial profiling by police, incarceration and homelessness.
“What we are seeing is a group of voters that are getting their political legs up under them and beginning to define what politics are going to be like for them post-Obama,” said Cornell Belcher, who was a pollster for the Obama campaign. “You will have a hard time getting to the White House as a Democrat without speaking to them and including them in your coalition.”
The activists at the forefront are sidestepping the usual brokers whom Democrats — especially white Democrats — go through to reach black voters.
“There is a sense that the traditional civil rights organizations have been far too cozy with whoever and not making clear enough demands,” said Fredrick Cornelius Harris, director of the Center on African-American Politics and Society at Columbia University. “They see these people as having failed them.”
It’s a point of concern with some of the older groups, like the Urban League, which embrace the attention Black Lives Matter has managed to direct toward racial disparity and injustice but express frustration that their own work is overlooked.
“We have been talking police accountability since before these incidents occurred,” Urban League President Marc Morial said of the events that spawned the Black Lives Matter movement.
The new generation, though, is decidedly more confrontational.
“Until we hear from candidates, beyond just saying, ‘Black lives matter’ — until we hear them really address how we are continuously cut out of the American democracy, we’re going to continue to shut debates down,” Cullors vowed. “We’re going to continue to call elected officials out. I mean, we’ve tried to set up meetings with elected officials, we’ve tried to send them emails — it does not work.”
Now some candidates are going to them. Clinton’s director for black outreach was on hand when the activists gathered at their inaugural Movement for Black Lives Convening last weekend in Cleveland. The campaign said the aide was there to listen.
The progressive grass-roots behemoth Democracy for America announced it was upending its advocacy model amid demands from the black activists that the overwhelmingly white group diversify and more aggressively confront racial injustice.
The African American activists, though, remain unimpressed. They say the candidates fall back on tired talking points without delivering a concrete agenda.
“Sometimes this country wants to keep its head in the sand and say, ‘We don’t have race issues,’” said Pastor Karen Anderson of Ward Chapel African Methodist Episcopal Church in Florissant, Mo., not far from where rioting took place in Ferguson after Michael Brown’s fatal shooting by a police officer last year. Anderson recently sat in on a round table Clinton held on racial justice.
The movement is emerging as a force in electoral politics, despite the spontaneous nature of many of its actions and its loose structure. Black activists have more strongly emphasized elections in the aftermath of events in Ferguson, where they led a push to vote out local officials, and organizers with experience mobilizing voters are building coalitions around Black Lives Matter.
The candidates are finding themselves constantly tested, even in states where there is little African American presence. Kareem Jordan, a criminal justice professor in Lowell, Mass., drove to Clinton’s town hall Tuesday in Nashua, N.H., where he was one of few blacks in an audience of 250. He questioned the candidate on mass incarceration.
Clinton, who decried racism in sentencing and emphasized the need to build trust between police and local communities, provided an answer Jordan found mostly adequate, though “a little vague.”
Jordan plans to vote for Clinton. But he says turning out the black vote the way Obama did is going to be “tough for her.” It’s hard, he said, for whites to talk about racial justice issues in a way that blacks find genuine. “There are gaffes.”

Black Lives Matter forces campaigns to toss their strategies on black voters,https://www.latimes.com/nation/ct-black-lives-matter-democrats-20150731-story.html,2015-07-31,"Patrisse Cullors speaks at a rally last year calling for civilian oversight of a proposed rebuilding of Men’s Central Jail in Los Angeles.
Reporting from Fort Lauderdale, Fla. —Democrats have never been more confident that their chances of hanging onto the White House hinge on black voters, who tipped key states toward President Obama -- but they have never been less confident, it seems, about how to talk to them.
The Black Lives Matter campaign is seeing to it that the rules they relied on for courting the vote no longer apply.
The potent social media-driven movement, sparked in the aftermath of Florida teen Trayvon Martin’s death and reignited in the racial unrest of the last year, has 2016 contenders scrambling to adjust their strategies. The protesters involved are proving masterful at refocusing the spotlight. Candidates who might have otherwise been complacent given their high marks on legislative report cards from the National Assn. for the Advancement of Colored People and endorsements from an older generation of black leaders have had to more directly confront uncomfortable questions of racial inequality and the mistreatment of blacks by the criminal justice system.
“We want to ensure that these candidates will actually deal with the issues that black people face,” said Patrisse Cullors, a co-founder of the movement who is from Los Angeles. “The reality is that it’s still not legal to be black in this country.”
The group’s demands are likely to drive discussion at a major conference of the National Urban League here Friday, where candidates of both parties will spar over the best approach for improving the lives of African Americans. Among the attendees are Democrat Hillary Rodham Clinton and Republican Jeb Bush, who both found themselves pushed off balance by Black Lives Matter in recent weeks on the campaign trail.
Black Lives Matter inserted itself into the race through a few well-timed and highly publicized confrontations with candidates -- several of which exposed politicians’ tone-deafness on racial issues. Often it was through a simple guerrilla action, during which activists demanded candidates repeat the words, “Black lives matter.”
Many flubbed it. Their frequent response that “all lives matter” was perceived by many blacks as a refusal to acknowledge the particular risks faced by those with black skin. Republicans generally pushed back, accusing the activists of stoking racial division.
Democrats, though, are aggressively positioning themselves as empathetic to the outrage that Black Lives Matter has tapped into. They are reeducating themselves on how to talk to black voters, sending surrogates to meet with the activists, shifting their rhetoric and -- in some cases -- issuing apologies.
Cullors said the group wants candidates to address poverty, racial profiling by police, incarceration and homelessness.
“What we are seeing is a group of voters that are getting their political legs up under them and beginning to define what politics are going to be like for them post-Obama,” said Cornell Belcher, who was a pollster for the Obama campaign. “You will have a hard time getting to the White House as a Democrat without speaking to them and including them in your coalition.”
The activists at the forefront are sidestepping the usual brokers whom Democrats -- especially white Democrats -- go through to reach out to black voters.
“There is a sense that the traditional civil-rights organizations have been far too cozy with whoever and not making clear enough demands,” said Fredrick Cornelius Harris, director of the Center on African-American Politics and Society at Columbia University. “They see these people as having failed them.”
It’s a point of concern with some of the older groups, like the Urban League, which embrace the attention Black Lives Matter has managed to direct toward racial disparity and injustice but express frustration that their own work in the trenches is getting overlooked.
“We have been talking police accountability since before these incidents occurred,” Urban League President Marc Morial said of the events that spawned the Black Lives Matter movement. “We say, ‘Look at the Urban League’s plan. This is part of our agenda.’”
The new generation, though, is decidedly more confrontational.
“Until we hear from candidates, beyond just saying ‘Black lives matter’ -- until we hear them really address how we are continuously cut out of the American democracy, we’re going to continue to shut debates down,” Cullors vowed. “We’re going to continue to call elected officials out. I mean, we’ve tried to set up meetings with elected officials, we’ve tried to send them emails -- it does not work.”
Now some candidates are going to them. Clinton’s director for black outreach was on hand when the activists gathered at their inaugural Movement for Black Lives Convening this month in Cleveland. The campaign said she was there to listen.
“We felt it was important to hear from those gathered in Cleveland,” said a statement from Clinton spokeswoman Karen Finney. “In order to implement real change, we need to work together in crafting policy, raising awareness and building a coalition to ensure every American knows what it means to be secure, safe and free.”
The progressive grass-roots behemoth Democracy for America announced it was upending its advocacy model amid charges from the black activists that the overwhelmingly white group was oblivious to the urgency of their cause.
The African American activists, though, remain unimpressed. They say all of the candidates continue to fall back on tired talking points, speaking in broad strokes about civil rights without delivering a concrete agenda.
“Sometimes this country wants to keep its head in the sand and say, ‘We don’t have race issues,’” said Pastor Karen Anderson of Ward Chapel African Methodist Episcopal Church in Florissant, Mo., not far from where the rioting took place in Ferguson last year. She recently sat in on a round table Clinton held on racial justice.
“Presidential candidates must hear the message, or they risk losing support and engagement from black voters,” Anderson said.
The movement threatens to be a force in electoral politics, despite the spontaneous nature of many of its actions and its loose structure. Black activists have more strongly emphasized elections in the aftermath of the Ferguson riots, where they led a push to vote out local officials, and some longtime organizers with deep experience mobilizing voters are starting to build coalitions around Black Lives Matter.
“The organizers of this movement are aware of the need to be engaged in electoral politics,” said Andra Gillespie, a professor at Emory College in Atlanta who studies political participation of African Americans. She said the organizing conference the group held in Cleveland last weekend was a signal the movement is coalescing in a way that lends itself to putting boots on the ground come election time.
The candidates are finding themselves constantly tested, even in states where there is little African American presence. Kareem Jordan, a criminal justice professor in Lowell, Mass., drove to Clinton’s town hall Tuesday in Nashua, N.H., where he was one of a handful of blacks in an audience of 250. He pushed the candidate on mass incarceration.
Clinton, who decried racism in sentencing and emphasized the need to build trust between police and local communities, provided an answer Jordan found mostly adequate, although “a little vague.”
Jordan plans to vote for Clinton. But he says turning out the black vote the way Obama did is going to be “tough for her.” It’s hard, he said, for whites to talk about racial justice issues in a way that blacks find genuine. “There are gaffes,” he said.

New wildfire off Interstate 15 jams traffic; 1 person hurt,https://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-ln-7-homes-lost-northern-california-fires-rage-on-20150731-story.html,2015-07-31,"Firefighters were battling another blaze in the Cajon Pass on Saturday, prompting the closure of several lanes of the 15 Freeway.
The Scales fire has burned 10 acres near the junction of the 15 and Highway 138 and injured at least one person, according to the National Forest Service. Several northbound lanes of the 15 were closed, and officials warned of traffic delays.
Officials said they were beginning to get a handle on the blaze, one of many burning across California. Just two weeks ago, another larger fire swept across the 15 in the pass, burning dozens of cars and forcing motorists to run for their lives.
A U.S. Forest Service firefighter died on the front lines in Modoc County as thousands fought numerous wildfires Saturday burning across Northern California.
The fire exploded amid record heat. On Saturday, some thunderstorms are forecast for the area.
David Ruhl, a South Dakota firefighter who had been working in California for several weeks, died Thursday while fighting the Frog fire, accordingto a statement on InciWeb.
Few details were immediately provided, but the statement said Ruhl’s body was found by search and rescue personnel.

“This loss of life is tragic and heartbreaking,” Forest Supervisor Amanda McAdams said in the statement. “Please keep the family and all of our Forest Service employees in your thoughts and prayers during this difficult time.”
Officials are investigating how Ruhl died.
Late Friday,Gov. Jerry Brown in a statementsaid he and his wife, Anne, “were saddened to learn of the tragic death” of Ruhl, “who left his home state to help protect one of California’s majestic forests. ... We extend our deepest condolences to his family, friends and colleagues with the U.S. Forest Service.”
The Frog fire has burned 800 acres near Adin in the northeast corner of the state.
The U.S. Forest Servicesaid it waslowering its flags to half-staff in Ruhl’s memory.
The announcement of Ruhl’s death came shortly after Brown declared a state of emergency.
“California’s severe drought and extreme weather have turned much of the state into a tinderbox,” Brown said in a statement. “Our courageous firefighters are on the front lines, and we’ll do everything we can to help them.”
The declaration will allow faster deployment of resources to the fire zones, including the National Guard, if deemed necessary.
The state of emergency came as a fast-moving fire north of Napa Valley continued to grow Friday and new evacuations were ordered for residents in a nearby rural town, authorities said.
The Rocky fire had grown to 22,000 acres Saturday and was 5% contained, according to a tweet from Daniel Berlant, a spokesman for the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection.
The Lake County Sheriff’s Department issued a mandatory evacuation order for Jerusalem Valley residents before 10 a.m., after the blaze moved north and jumped a road.
About 650 residents have fled their homes since the blaze began Wednesday afternoon.
Water-dropping aircraft and firefighters on the ground have been working around the clock to douse the flames and dig a containment line around the blaze, according to Cal Fire.
The Rocky fire began at 4:10 p.m. Wednesday near Morgan Valley and Rocky Creek roads, 62 miles north of Napa, and traveled quickly, spreading into heavy brush and woodlands, Cal Fire said.
Firefighters were still assessing the damage caused by the massive blaze, but officials said the flames have destroyed three structures and multiple outbuildings.
The blaze is one of 18 large wildfires burning in California, requiring the deployment of nearly 8,000 firefighters.
In response to the wildfires, the National Guard mobilized nine helicopters to help state firefighters. Authorities are worried that thunderstorms forecast for the weekend could trigger dry-lightning strikes and more blazes.
On Thursday, a fire swept through an Isleton mobile home park, destroying seven mobile homes and forcing residents to flee. A small vegetation fire in the Solano County delta town got out of control and reached the homes before firefighters could quell the flames.
“We don’t have a hydrant system out here, so once our apparatus runs out of water, we have to rely on water from river drafting, which takes up a little bit of effort setting that up,” Jessie Rosewall, assistant chief of the River Delta Fire Department, told KTXL-TV.

"Hail, lightning, heavy rains slam parts of Southern California",https://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-ln-hail-lightning-heavy-rains-slams-parts-of-southern-california-20150731-story.html,2015-07-31,"Hot, humid conditions are expected to remain in Southern California through the weekend, along with periodic thunderstorms in mountain and high desert areas.
On Thursday, hail, flooding and a lightning-caused fire hit parts of the region.
More than an inch of rain fell in an hour in Escondido, while a downpour in Antelope Valley sent mud flowing onto the 14 Freeway, said NWS weather specialist Stuart Seto. Just before 4 p.m. a lightning strike sparked a fire in brush near Vista del Lago Road and Interstate 5, the California Highway Patrol said.

The turbulent weather is part of a surge of monsoonal moisture that’s expected to cover Southern California through the weekend.
Debris flows are possible in the Colby fire burn area, where about 1,900 acres were scorched in the hills above Azusa and Glendora in 2014.
In Northern California, Bay Area residents will feel a big cool-down as temperatures drop by 10 to 15 degrees, according to the weather service.
The moisture and humidity will linger over the mountains and desert until Sunday -- and perhaps into next week. Highs will reach the 90s inland and the 70s along the coast Friday.
Weather officials say a powerful mass of high pressure is moving west from Texas.
Winds that typically pull in weather from the ocean are instead dragging weather from the tropics. Rising sea temperatures related to El Niño are playing a role in this week’s storm.
Rain over the last couple of weeks caused flooding in parts of Southern California and helped douse some wildfires but did nothing for reservoirs, according to meteorologist Richard Heim of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s National Climatic Data Center. Reservoir levels did not increase, and for the most part, California remained dry.

Living on tinder hooks in forest fire country,https://www.latimes.com/local/abcarian/la-me-0731-abcarian-willow-fire-20150731-column.html,2015-07-31,"reporting from NORTH FORK, Calif. —From this teensy town, which bills itself as the “exact center of California,” the Willow fire did not look especially menacing. White smoke billowed up, away from people, away from homes, into the Sierra National Forest’s clear blue sky.
Scattered homes and two campgrounds near the fire area had been evacuated over the weekend, but no one sought refuge with the Red Cross in Oakhurst until Thursday, when a mandatory evacuation was ordered for Cascadel Woods, a hamlet about a mile from the flames. The local pet shelter tended 20 displaced cats and dogs, plus one goldfish.
Vacationers a few miles away at Bass Lake paused to watch the weirdly picturesque scene. They were fascinated by the Sky Crane helicopters, which arrived at the lake every few minutes, looking like wasps as they dipped their stingers into the water to fill up. Up on the ridge lines, fixed-wing jets let out their loads of retardant, leaving brilliant orange trails that disappeared into the treetops.
In North Fork’s community center, the women’s club had just finished putting out dinner for a citizens group working on a plan to revitalize the site of the town’s old mill, which closed in 1996.
“When it’s this close, it’s scary,” said Donna Rodriguez, who has already been through two other forest fires this season. A transplant from what she described as Sonoma County’s “rat race,” she has adapted to life in forest fire country in unexpected ways.
“In the summer here,” she said, “the first thing you do in the morning is open your door and smell.”
The Willow fire, about 40 miles northeast of Fresno, is not the biggest wildfire burning in California this week. Nor is it the scariest fire of the season. That distinction, for my money, goes to the North fire, whose fast-moving flames jumped busy Interstate 15 in the Cajon Pass, torching 20 cars and semis that were trapped in traffic.
But the state’s extreme drought, which has left trees and soil devoid of moisture, means that any wildfire has the potential to grow into something frightful.
There are other exacerbating factors as well. No major fire has burned through this part of the forest in more than 100 years. And a tiny beetle has been ravaging the pine trees, taking advantage of their weakened state by infesting their bark. If you didn’t know better, the forest’s riot of green and gold might put you in mind of New England during leaf-peeping season. Except the gold trees are dead.
When they ignite, they don’t just burn; they explode.
::
Fires create their own weather systems. They also create their own communities. Less than two days after the Willow blaze started, a temporary firefighting village had sprung up on a vacant lot near North Fork’s abandoned mill site, complete with a “Main Street” running between white trailers. Across the way, someone was already selling $20 commemorative T-shirts.
Some 1,545 firefighters from more than a dozen federal, state and local agencies had gathered at the command center, some from as far away as New Mexico.
“We’re a well-oiled machine,” said Sean Collins, a Kern County firefighter who doubles as public information officer for the consortium in charge of this fire, the South Central Sierra Interagency Incident Management Team. “We know our jobs.”
All the experience in the world, though, does not change the fact that firefighters toil in extreme conditions. They work in steep, unforgiving terrain, hacking away at dead trees, grasses and chaparral to carve firebreaks into the earth. They carry packs that weigh 35 to 45 pounds. They eat 5,000-calorie meals. They work 12-hour shifts.
Later, as I turned in for the night at my comfortable hotel, I pictured the firefighters on the mountain and felt a twinge of guilt.
Twice a day, at 6 a.m. and 6 p.m., the firefighters gather in a big semicircle around a makeshift stage to receive their assignments and updates on the blaze, which has consumed more than 3,000 acres.
Meteorologist Dan Harty warned of the inversion that occurs at night, when smoke, instead of drifting up, settles on the ground. “No clouds in the sky,” said Harty, “but lots of smoke up there to worry about.”
Taro Pusina, a fire behavior analyst who works for the National Park Service in Yosemite, tells firefighters what the fire is expected to do.
Midweek, as he correctly predicted, the fire was spreading rapidly in some areas. All the fuel meant crews were having trouble taming its “hot edge.”
On Thursday, the fire was 30% contained but moving slowly toward homes, prompting the mandatory evacuation, said Cody Norris of the U.S. Forest Service.
::
Early this week, Madera County Dist. Atty. David Linn announced the fire was started Saturday by a teenage boy who had been hiking with his family in a remote area. Linn said Wednesday he expects to charge the boy, a juvenile, with a criminal misdemeanor that could result in detention and counseling.
The boy told investigators that he took a lighter and ran into the forest with a sibling. He picked up a pine branch and lighted the needles to watch them burn. The needles dropped onto the parched forest floor, igniting it.
The teen, who had attended a fire safety program at his school, tried to clear away ground cover, Linn said. When that failed, he ripped off his shirt and tried to beat the fire out. His parents tried to douse the fire with water. They called 911 as soon as they reached a road with cell service.
So far, the fire hasn’t claimed any lives or destroyed any homes. Three firefighters have suffered from dehydration, but no one has been seriously injured. And rain is on the way.

"‘I don’t know why people do evil things,’ says grandma of 4-year-old boy shot to death in Highland",https://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-ln-boy-killed-playing-outside-20150730-story.html,2015-07-31,"Daniel Munoz, 4, who was playing in front of his grandmother’s house, was shot and killed Wednesday night in the small San Bernardino County city of Highland.
The day was spent under the inland sun — running around the frontyard of his grandmother’s Highland home, splashing in the plastic wading pool. Daniel Munoz eventually went down for a nap, but when he woke, the 4-year-old rushed back outside to play once more, his arms clutching a stuffed bear he called Superman.
The blasts rang out in quick succession. Fireworks, his family thought, as they picked fruit and watered plants in the frontyard Wednesday evening.
Then the terror set in.

Daniel lay face down next to an orange tree. Blood pooled beneath his body, onto the dusty sidewalk. His 5-year-old cousin would later describe Daniel’s fetal position. “He was like this,” Julio Cesar Munoz said Thursday as he folded his hands under his head and leaned over.
Daniel was taken to a nearby hospital where he was pronounced dead.
San Bernardino County sheriff’s deputies have offered few details about the shooting and have asked for the public’s help. They released a photo of a person of interest: an unidentified young man in a white tank top at a convenience store. They also are looking for a white 1990s, four-door Toyota Camry with black bumpers.
“Children are innocent, especially at the age of 4 — it’s tragic and senseless for a child to have to suffer from an act like that,” Deputy Adam Cervantes said. “I think it gives us a sense of urgency to want to bring who’s responsible to justice.”
San Bernardino County has seen about 60 homicides so far this year, according to the coroner’s office.
Family members said they think the shooting may be related to a feud between a group that frequently gathers across the street from the home and whoever was in a car that quickly sped away after the shots were fired.
At the home on McKinley Avenue, a trail of blood led to the back of the property, marking the path Daniel’s aunt took in a panic as she held her nephew.
Daniel, who lived with his family in Rialto, had wanted to go to Knott’s Berry Farm that day with an older sibling and cousins, who were being chaperoned by his mother, Yuliana Morales, but there wasn’t enough room in the van. Morales made a promise: Next time it would be his turn.
Now his mother can’t shake the guilt. “It’s my fault for leaving him here,” Morales said.
But Daniel’s grandmother said she feels her own burden of blame.
Leaning against her front door for support, Ramona Perez struggled to speak about the loss of the boy with the brown eyes and toothy smile. She said she will never make sense of what happened — her grandson, she said, only wanted to play.
“I don’t know why people do evil things like this,” she said.
A small city of about 54,000 in the foothills of the San Bernardino Mountains, Highland sees its shareof violence, said neighbors who stopped by Thursday to offer comfort to the family.
In October, a man who held hostage a woman and two children was fatally shot by deputies. The woman, who was found with a gunshot wound, later died. Six months earlier, a Highland couple had been found slain inside their home.
In an attempt to address increasing violent crime in the region, authorities last year arrested 102 individuals in Highland during an operation called SMASH — San Bernardino Movement Against Street Hoodlums.
The purpose of the sweep — which included suspects for burglary, vehicle theft, sex registrant violations, narcotics sales and weapons charges — was to target and identify gang members within the city, according to a San Bernardino County sheriff’s statement.
In December, authorities in Highland and San Bernardino arrested 33 known members of the Crips and Bloods in their communities.
“There is a problem and the problem is not being solved,” said Edgar Smith, who lost two sons — ages 18 and 31 — to gun violence within the last year. One was killed in Highland, the other in San Bernardino.
Smith’s wife, Denise, said Daniel’s death raised the issue of every parent’s fundamental right:
“Your children should be able to come out in their yard and play freely without you being worried about them being hurt or shot.”

"Solar is in, biomass energy is out&#8212;and farmers are struggling to dispose of woody waste",https://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-biomass-closing-20160101-story.html,2016-01-01,"California’s biomass energy plants, which burn woody waste to generate electricity, are folding in rapid succession.
Reporting From Fresno —It should have been a good year for turning wood and waste into electrons.
A record-setting drought forced growers to bulldoze thousands of acres of trees, and hardly anyone in the Central Valley has permission to light bonfires anymore.
But more than trees have withered in California’s sun. The state’s biomass energy plants are folding in rapid succession, unable to compete with heavily subsidized solar farms, many of which have sprouted up amid the fields and orchards of the San Joaquin Valley.
Paul Parreira is painfully aware of the irony. The third-generation grower and almond processor is running out of dirt roads where he can spread ground-up almond shells, even as he expands a one-megawatt solar array on six acres of his family’s property in Los Banos.
The waste-to-energy facilities where Parreira used to send about 50,000 tons of shells per year are vanishing. Six have closed in just two years, the latest in Delano, which shut down Thursday, after San Diego Gas & Electric ended its power purchase agreement. Twenty-five people were laid off, and 19 will remain to complete closure of the plant, said Dennis Serpa, fuels manager of the 50-megawatt plant, owned and operated by Covanta.
The Rio Bravo biomass facility south of Fresno is taking some of the fuel that would have gone to Delano. But short of a miracle, the 25-megawatt plant run by IHI Power Services Corp. will burn its last wood chips in July, when its power purchase agreement with Pacific Gas & Electric Co. expires.
The Sacramento Municipal Utility District, meanwhile, is locked in a dispute with the 18-megawatt Buena Vista biomass facility in Ione, and has threatened to terminate its contract, according to district spokesman Christopher Capra.
The closures have forced the San Joaquin Valley Air Pollution Control District to consider allowing more agricultural waste to be burned in open piles, which produces particulate matter and ozone-forming compounds associated with cardiovascular illnesses.
Air quality already is notoriously bad throughout the district — four of the five dirtiest metropolitan areas, based on ozone and particulate measures, are in the valley, according to the American Lung Assn. Based only on measures of particulate matter, the Fresno-Madera area was the worst in the nation, followed by Bakersfield, Visalia-Porterville-Hanford, and Modesto-Merced.
A policy change on open burning would require extensive public hearings. But the district may have little choice.
“Do not underestimate the fact that state law requires that if farmers do not have an economically feasible alternative, the district is prohibited from banning the open burning of those materials,” Executive Director Seyed Sadredin cautioned the district’s governing board at its November monthly meeting. “We have 11 farmers right now that are risking the loss of hundreds of thousands of dollars if they do not find a way to dispose of that material.”
No one expects a wholesale return to bonfires wafting smoke across the Central Valley. But without the revenue from selling farm waste to the biomass plants, the costs of clearing agricultural debris are expected to skyrocket.
“It’s going to triple the cost to farmers,” said Frank Sanchez, who owns a tree-grinding service that is one of the top customers at Rio Bravo. “They’re going to be paying about $1,000 to $1,200 an acre just to do the same work that you were doing before for about $300 an acre.”
Sanchez pared his profit margin to zero in October, hoping to keep his clients until the market improves. If it doesn’t, he’ll lay off as many as 30 workers from his Wasco-based company.
Tejon Ranch, one of his clients, knocked down 160 acres of almond trees in 2015. But the debris will stay on the farm. “For 160 acres, you’re looking at 200 or so truckloads,” said Trey Irwin, vice president of agriculture for Tejon, a conservancy that has a strict no-burn policy. “It’s pretty hard to find a home for 200 truckloads.”
Some growers have begun experimenting with a more advanced farm-scale technology, but it could be a decade or more before those can be scaled up, industry experts say.
“The new technology is just not developed yet to the scale that we are,” said Rick Spurlock, general manager of the Rio Bravo Fresno plant. “We are a utility-scaled plant. We’re handling 200,000 tons of fuel. It would take 25 of those facilities to equal one of these facilities.
“But problem is, that future is 10 to 15 years away and the problem we have is today.” The experimental plants burn about 100 pounds of hulls per hour, while the largest biomass plants can handle a ton per hour.
Meanwhile, the incentives to switch to solar are strong. Parreira broke ground on his one-megawatt plant five years ago, when he could get a subsidized rate of 15 cents a kilowatt-hour.
“I’m here to tell you, there was a whole bunch of welfare that went along with that deal,” Parreira said. But, he added, “You can certainly argue that biomass had its day in the sun, 20 years ago, when it had its subsidies.”
Biomass-to-electricity plants — essentially hyper-efficient wood furnaces linked to steam turbines — owe their existence to federal alternative-energy mandates enacted on the heels of the 1970s energy crisis. In the 1980s, more than 60 biomass plants in California turned 10 million tons of woody waste into about 2% of the state’s electricity, according to the National Renewable Energy Laboratory. By the turn of the century, the industry already had contracted by more than a third, amid deregulation of California’s grid, according to the lab.
By 2011, California’s biomass industry faced a cliff. Its long-term contracts and a key subsidy paid by ratepayers were about to expire. New purchase agreements would be tied more closely to the cost of natural gas, and those prices were plummeting.
Rick Spurlock holds some of the ash residue that is repurposed as ground cover for dairy cattle facilities.
Pacific Gas & Electric Co. renegotiated purchase agreements with Rio Bravo and another facility in Mendota, along with three others in Northern California. The utility agreed to pay a higher rate in exchange for an earlier exit from contracts. San Diego Gas & Electric got the same deal from Delano.
Now down to 25 plants with a capacity of 611 megawatts, the biomass industry is taking its case to Sacramento, bolstered by Gov. Jerry Brown’s latest drought-related emergency proclamation. It touts biomass energy generation as a solution to culling dead trees that pose a wildfire threat in the Sierra Nevada. The San Joaquin Valley facilities are a short distance from the most browned swaths, advocates note. They are hoping for some direct funding or a way to pass costs to utilities, and ultimately to consumers.
Advocates for biomass say utilities and their regulators should factor other benefits of biomass into the rates — the plants prevent pollution from open burning and help municipalities comply with state rules to reduce landfilling.
“With wind and solar, you just get electrons,” said Julee Malinowski-Ball, executive director of the California Biomass Energy Alliance, an industry advocacy group. “With biomass you get all this added benefit.”
Utilities aren’t buying it.
“We have not made a conscious decision to back away from biomass contracts,” said Stephanie Donovan, spokeswoman for San Diego Gas & Electric Co. “We have had a philosophy of being technology agnostic. What we really are looking for is the least-cost, best-fit resource.”
PG&E said its renegotiations with biomass providers were not motivated by a desire to terminate contracts early. The utility “buys more bioenergy than any other energy purchaser in California, with biomass accounting for 17% of our renewable portfolio currently,” said spokesman Denny Boyles.
To protect ratepayers, biomass “must be competitive with alternative renewable resources,” Boyles said. “Our contract terms are reviewed and approved by the CPUC to ensure that they balance the interests of obtaining more biomass generation at reasonable prices and under reasonable terms.”

"AQMD plan would fight smog mainly through incentives, not rules",https://www.latimes.com/local/la-me-ln-smog-plan-20160630-snap-story.html,2016-07-01,"For decades, regulators have attacked Southern California’s notorious smog through an ever-stricter array of regulations that forced polluters to deploy cleaner technology.
Buta planreleased Thursday by the South Coast Air Quality Management District takes a more industry-friendly approach. It relies on finding billions in incentive funds to encourage people and businesses to voluntarily transition to lower-polluting cars, trucks and equipment.
The proposal outlines how regulators plan to curb the nation’s worst smog to meet a series of federal deadlines over the next 15 years by giving priority to “nonregulatory” approaches. In addition to seeking $11 to $14 billion in incentive money, the plan would take credit for “co-benefits,” the air quality improvements expected to result from climate change, transportation and energy efficiency programs being carried out by other agencies.
The plan’s reliance on voluntary measures and credits rather than traditional regulations sparked immediate criticism from environmentalists. They said the proposal lacks funding and enforcement mechanisms, and would shift financial responsibility for cleaning the air toward taxpayers and away from polluting industries.
“This is not a real plan, it’s a promise to let polluters off the hook,” said Angela Johnson Meszaros, an attorney for the environmental nonprofit Earthjustice.
The plan is the latest indication of a shift at the powerful pollution control agency, which is responsible for protecting the health of 17 million people across a vast basin that spans Los Angeles, Orange, Riverside and San Bernardino counties.
The AQMD has come under fire from environmentalists and state lawmakers since Republicans took control of its governing board and fired its longtime executive this year, with some new members pledging to make pollution regulations easier on businesses.
Regulators have made tremendous progress on reducing Southern California smog, with pollution levels dropping to about a third of what they were in the 1970s and ’80s. But the the region remains far from meeting federal health standards and progress has leveled off in recent years. AQMD officials say they have nearly exhausted their options for reducing smog-forming pollutants through traditional control measures.
“We think we’ve gone as far as we can and what’s left is going to be these innovative approaches,” said Philip Fine, a deputy executive officer with the air district. “We don’t see any other way.”
The plan’s main target is ozone, the lung-searing gas that forms when pollution from cars, trucks, factories and other combustion sources reacts in the heat and sunlight. Ozone pollution, which triggers asthma and other respiratory problems, plagues Southern California’s inland valleys and mountains, reaching the nation’s worst levels on hot summer afternoons.
To meet federal health standards, the region must cut emissions of ozone-forming nitrogen oxides to under 100 tons per day by 2031, or 55% beyond all existing regulations, from the current level of about 500 tons per day.
Central to the plan is a proposal to spend $11 billion to $14 billion on emissions-cutting incentive programs over the next 15 years, a nearly 20-fold increase from the $56 million a year in incentive funds the district receives now.
While no specific funding sources were identified, the plan says Congress could create a national fund for cleaning the regions with the most polluted air, an idea modeled on the federal Superfund program for hazardous waste sites.
Evan Gillespie, who directs the Sierra Club’s My Generation campaign, was skeptical. “The air district has no way of paying for the incentives now, nor do they even have a defensible plan to raise the money needed,” he said.
The pursuit of alternatives to traditional regulations reflects a longstanding complaint by local pollution regulators that they have little control over some of the biggest sources of pollution. While heavy-duty trucks, cars, locomotives, cargo ships and other mobile sources emit more than 80% of the region’s nitrogen oxides, they are regulated by state and federal authorities.
Among the measures proposed in the plan is an ultra-low emissions standard for heavy-duty trucks that the air district has petitioned the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency to adopt.
The plan identifies some traditional regulations to cut pollution from industrial flares, as well as from cooking burners in homes and restaurants. It also includes a proposal for additional pollution cuts to a cap-and-trade program for oil refineries and other major facilities that is likely to face opposition from the petroleum industry. But the strategies for cutting emissions from facilities in the freight sector -- including ports, warehouses and rail yards -- would be executed on a voluntary basis, AQMD officials said.
Business groups said they were reviewing the plan.
In a statement, Western States Petroleum Assn. President Catherine Reheis-Boyd said her group wants to work “toward a thoughtful, balanced approach that is in the overall best interest of the South Coast Basin.”
The public has until Aug. 19 to comment on the plan before it is revised. Officials expect the proposal to go before the air-quality board for consideration in December. The state Air Resources Board must approve the plan before sending it along to the EPA for review.

TheTrailhead firebroke out Tuesday along the middle fork of the American River near Todd Valley, about 50 miles northeast of Sacramento, according to the Department of Forestry and Fire Protection.
Amid temperatures in the 90s and low humidity, the fire grew Thursday by at least 300 acres as about 1,900 firefighters sought to control the blaze.
See the most-read stories this hour >>
There were no reports of drones interfering with firefighters. Since Tuesday, at least two people flew hobby drones near the blaze, grounding firefighting aircraft until the area was clear.
It’s against the law to pilot a drone near a wildfire because of temporary flight restrictions and Federal Aviation Administration regulations.
The fire had burned 1,564 acres and was 12% contained Thursday evening.
Flames spread amid dense vegetation and heavy timber in the remote area, forcing firefighters to initially depend on air tankers and helicopters.
The fire is threatening about2,600 homesand other structures. No homes had been damaged as of Thursday night, and no injuries had been reported, according to Cal Fire.
The fire has spread southward and was active mostly in El Dorado County and the Eldorado National Forest. There, steep and inaccessible terrain – along with upward winds in area canyons – have posed difficulties for firefighters.
Officials in El Dorado County issued evacuation orders to residents along more than 30 streets north of Georgetown. Mandatory evacuations also were issued for residents on several streets and in a mobile home park in Placer County, where the northern flank of the fire is burning. On Thursday morning, the community of Volcanoville was under a voluntary evacuation order.
The American Red Cross opened a shelter at Gold Country Fairgrounds in Auburn. El Dorado County officials also designated Golden Sierra High School in Garden Valley as an evacuation shelter.
A community meeting was scheduled to be held at 7 p.m. Thursday at Golden Sierra High School, where fire officials planned to provide additional updates to residents regarding the fire.

Woman who drove with pedestrian in windshield is charged with vehicular manslaughter while drunk,https://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-ln-oceanside-driver-corpse-mile-charges-20160629-snap-story.html,2016-06-29,"An Oceanside woman was charged Wednesday with gross vehicular manslaughter while drunk after she plowed into a pedestrian and then drove a mile with his body lodged in the passenger seat, according to prosecutors.
Along with manslaughter, Esteysi Sanchez also faces charges for hit and run resulting in death, driving under the influence and driving without a license, according to a San Diego County criminal complaint. The complaint alleges Sanchez’s blood alcohol level was .15% or higher — nearly twice the legal limit.
Sanchez, 29, is being held in lieu of $1.5 million bail. On Wednesday, she was ordered to wear an alcohol and location monitoring bracelet if she is released on bail.
The victim, Jack Ray Tenhulzen, was walking along a sidewalk before 6:30 a.m. Monday when he was struck, authorities said.
After the crash, Sanchez drove about a mile down the road, parked haphazardly in a residential neighborhood in Oceanside and walked home. Her boyfriend called police and Sanchez was arrested about an hour later, officials said.
According to police, the force of the collision caused the victim to smash through the windshield and come to a rest in the front passenger seat.
Sanchez, an Oceanside resident, does not have a driver’s license, according to DMV records. She applied for one in March 2015 but the process was not completed.
Witnesses told KNSD that the man was on the sidewalk and the car jumped the curb and hit him. They told the station that one of his legs was ripped from his body and landed on the trunk of her car.

“There’s no words to really describe it. I mean, just seeing that up close and personal, it’s kind of traumatizing in a way,” witness Edwin Esparza told KNSD.
The victim was described as a known transient in his 60s, whose listed address was a local soup kitchen, officials said.
His shoes, wallet, keys and ID — as well as parts of the shattered windshield — were found where he was hit. Paramedics pronounced him dead where the car was found.
If convicted of the charges, Sanchez faces up to 15 years and six months in prison.

Death toll rises to four in California wildfires as bodies found in rural area,https://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-ln-erskine-fire-evacuations-20160629-snap-story.html,2016-06-29,"A series of deadly brush fires that hit Southern California this month claimed two more victims, as authorities Wednesday confirmed the discovery of two bodies in a rural area scorched by the Border fire in San Diego County.
That brings the number to four people killed by the fires, which together burned more than 60,000 acres and destroyed more than 100 homes, the vast majority in communities near Lake Isabella in Kern County.
As of Wednesday, 4,000 firefighters are battling 12 large wildfires throughout California, according to California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection spokesman Daniel Berlant.
It marks a destructive start to what officials have warned could be a grim fire season as California enters a fifth year of drought and some forests are filled with dead or dying trees stricken by the bark beetle.
Residents near the U.S.-Mexico border said Wednesday that they had found two bodies believed to be those of a couple who had been missing since the 7,609-acre Border fire erupted near Potrero last week.
The San Diego County Sheriff’s Department confirmed the discovery later that afternoon, saying the remains of what appeared to be two bodies were found behind a large boulder in a ravine. The medical examiner removed the bodies and will make the final identification on the cause and manner of death, said Jan Caldwell, a sheriff’s spokeswoman.
Deputies had searched the area Monday and Tuesday but had found nothing.
“We searched the property, which is rather large and difficult terrain,” Caldwell said. “We did not have success … it’s a very difficult property to search.”
Although authorities have yet to identify the remains, Potrero resident Iris Gardner said that searchers believe they are those of Jim Keefe, known locally as “Barefoot Jim,” and his girlfriend, Kyrie. Gardner said she did not know the girlfriend’s last name. The pair had been missing for roughly a week.
The Border fire, which is now 95% contained, is just one of many large fires crews have been battling in extremely hot, dry conditions.
On Tuesday, authorities in Kern County announced the lifting of evacuation orders in the deadly Erskine fire — the worst wildfire to erupt in California so far this year. The blaze has raced across 46,000 acres andkilledByron McKaig, 81, and his 90-year-old wife, Gladys.

A neighbor who found the bodies of the couple outside the ruins of their Squirrel Mountain Valley home on Friday said it appeared that Byron had died trying to protect his wife.
“He was like on top of her, and they were together, like he was blocking her from the fire,” Bill Johnson said Tuesday. “It made me sick because immediately I saw and knew exactly what had happened – that they were alive and ran out of this burning inferno and got stuck, and that’s where they ended. I thought it was terrible for those people to go like that. Just horrible. They didn’t deserve it.”
Officials say the fire is now 60% contained and evacuees can return to South Lake, although there was no power or water. Evacuation orders in other areas were lifted earlier in the week.
Other large Southern California fires, including the Sherpa fire and San Gabriel Complex fire, are mostly contained.
The Sherpa fire burned 7,474 acres, and the San Gabriel Complex fire — which is actually two separate fires, the Reservoir fire and the Fish fire — burned 5,399 acres.
In Northern California, fire crews are working to contain the Trailhead fire, which has forced mandatory evacuations for parts of Placer and El Dorado counties.
The fire, which is 5% contained, has burned 650 acres since it began Tuesday afternoon and is threatening 2,444 structures, according to Cal Fire.

"Deadly Soberanes fire north of Big Sur grows to 40,000 acres",https://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-ln-soberanes-fire-grows-to-38000-acres-20160731-snap-story.html,2016-08-01,"The deadly wildfire raging north of Big Sur continued to grow in size on Sunday and has now burned 40,000 acres and destroyed nearly 70 structures.
About 5,300 firefighters are battling the Soberanes fire, which is now just 18% contained, according to the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection. Since it began July 22, the fire has also claimed the life of a bulldozer operator.
Pushed by strong southerly winds, the blaze has shifted away from coastal homes and is moving southeast into the heart of the Los Padres National Forest, said Maria Lara, spokeswoman for Cal Fire.
“It’s good in a way, but it means there will be more acreage burning,” Lara said. “It’s also more steep terrain to put our crews in, and sometimes we don’t have access to those areas.”
Cal Fire said that the blaze, which is larger than the area of the city of San Francisco, “remained active” on Sunday, traveling uphill and sending out embers that sparked spot fires.
Since it started at Soberanes Creek in Garrapata State Park, the fire spread and now threatens 2,000 homes and structures, according to Cal Fire. Some 57 homes and 11 outbuildings have been destroyed. Three homes and two buildings have also suffered damage.
The wildfire killed Robert Reagan III, a bulldozer operator called in Tuesday to help battle the fire. At some point, he suffered fatal injuries in a remote area on the southeast end of the fire in Garrapata State Park in Carmel, authorities said.
The fire has prompted the closure of six state parks along the Central Coast through Aug. 6, and all trails and roads in the Monterey District of Los Padres National Forest, Cal Fire said.
About 500 residents have been evacuated in Palo Colorado and the areas of Rocky Creek, Weston Ridge Road, Garrapatos Road, and Highway 1 at Old Coast Road south to Old Coast Road at Bixby Creek Road.

On Sunday morning, the Monterey County Sheriff’s Department issued evacuation warnings for parts of the communities of Tassajara and Cachagua.
Palo Colorado, Robinson Canyon Road and Weston Ridge Road at Highway 1 were closed.
Flames have also encroached on illegal marijuana growing operations and led to unexpected rescues.
On Monday, two people were tending to marijuana plants when they became trapped by flames. They were found by Monterey County sheriff’s deputies. All 900 marijuana plants were destroyed by the fire.
The cause of the fire remains under investigation.

"Heat and withered brush feed wildfires burning in Riverside, Orange counties",https://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-ln-southern-california-fires-20160831-snap-story.html,2016-09-01,"Warm temperatures, low humidity and withered brush fed a wildfire in the rugged Orange County hills that charred 155 acres Wednesday as crews hustled to stop the spread of the flames.
In neighboring Riverside County, firefighters continued to battle the Bogart fire, which grew to more than 2 square miles.
The Holy fire started in the early morning just east of Trabuco Canyon in the Cleveland National Forest, according to Orange County Fire Authority Capt. Larry Kurtz.
By late Wednesday, the blaze was 5% contained.
The flames were not threatening homes but burned in steep, dry hillsides around Holy Jim Canyon and raced up north-facing slopes coated in light grasses and shrubbery. The vegetation was “starved for moisture,” Kurtz said.
Voluntary evacuations were issued for canyon-area residents.
But once the fire reached the top of the hills — in sweltering heat that hovered in the mid-90s — the flames stalled, Kurtz said.
“The wind is not acting on the fire. It slows down the fire’s rate of spread and gives us the chance to contain it,” he added.
Four firefighters suffered non-life-threatening injuries and were airlifted to local hospitals, Kurtz said.
Hundreds of firefighters in Riverside County continued to battle theBogart fire, which broke out Tuesday afternoon near Beaumont’s Bogart Park.
Investigators with the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection have said the fire was caused by “juvenile activity.”
The blaze spread in the hills west of the Morongo Reservation and destroyed at least one building, fire officials said. Authorities said that by Wednesday evening, the fire had charred 1,470 acres and was 60% contained.
About 700 residents were initially evacuated, but authorities canceled the evacuation order by Tuesday night.
More than 400 firefighters have been assigned to combat the fire. Of those, four firefighters suffered non-life-threatening injuries and were treated at a hospital.

"In West Coast visit, President Obama goes after climate change skeptics, praises efforts to restore Lake Tahoe",https://www.latimes.com/politics/la-pol-ca-tahoe-obama-20160901-snap-story.html,2016-09-01,"Reporting from Stateline, Nevada —At a conservation summit on the southern shore of Lake Tahoe, President Obama on Wednesday pointed to the environmental degradation of the lake’s once-crystal-clear waters as proof of the damage caused by climate change and warned of the threat posed by Republican leaders who continue to deny its existence.
Obama never named Republican members in Congress or GOP presidential nominee Donald Trump, who have questioned whether climate change is real and opposed international efforts to address the issue, but the president’s pointed critique left no doubt of his targets.
“The future generations deserve clear water and clean air that will sustain their bodies and sustain their souls — jewels like Lake Tahoe,” Obama told a packed outdoor arena gathered for the 20thannual Lake Tahoe environment summit. “It sure is not going to happen if we pretend a snowball in winter means nothing is wrong. It’s not going to happen if we boast about how we’re going to scrap international treaties, or have elected officials who are alone in the world in denying climate change, or put our energy and environmental policies in the hands of big polluters.”
Obama arrived in Lake Tahoe as the guest of Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid of Nevada, who helped to kick off the summit 20 years ago when leaders in California and Nevada became alarmed that Lake Tahoe’s legendary clear water was clouding up.
Attended by California Democratic Sens. Dianne Feinstein and Barbara Boxer as well as Gov. Jerry Brown, Wednesday’s environmental summit also served as a long farewell for Reid, who is retiring after three decades in the Senate.
Obama spoke warmly of Reid’s love for his state’s natural wonders and his tenacity in Washington, crediting him for helping deliver many of his top accomplishments as president.
“Harry is tough,” Obama said. “I believe he’s going to go down as one of the best leaders the Senate has ever had.”
In Nevada, a crucial swing state in the upcoming presidential election and home to a hotly contested Senate race, the two-hour chorus of speeches was laced with the clear message that the environmental priorities championed by Democratic leaders in Washington, California and Nevada were crucial for the nation’s future.
President Clinton attended the first Lake Tahoe summit in 1997, also at the invitation of Reid, bringing national and international attention to the fate of the lake, which is a popular resort area.
Since that summit, about $2 billion has been spent to improve Lake Tahoe’s water quality and for projects to reduce runoff, restore wetlands and restrict development. Thanks to those efforts, scientists say the clarity in the lake has been steadily improving.
“One need only gaze in these emerald blue waters to see the progress we’ve made to keep Tahoe blue,” Reid said.
Feinstein and Boxer also were showered with praise Wednesday for their dedication to environmental protection and, more specifically, their work pushing through legislation in 2000 that provided $300 million in federal funds to restore the lake. Boxer also is retiring after serving for more than two decades in the Senate.
The two California senators have joined with their counterparts in Nevada in an effort to reauthorize the Lake Tahoe Restoration Act, which is still pending in Congress, and provide hundreds of millions of dollars more to protect the lake from pollutants and restore the health of the surrounding forests.
Lake Tahoe straddles the California-Nevada border, and planning and development in the region are controlled principally by a bi-state agency created decades ago by then-Govs. Ronald Reagan and Paul Laxalt.
Brown noted the irony of two Republican governors overcoming their distaste of government to create a new bureaucracy specifically to protect Lake Tahoe.
“Unlike other lakes in the world that become nothing but dumps and dead zones, this is still a pristine wonder,” Brown said. “And the human imagination is so encouraged and nourished by it that Republicans and Democrats actually worked together to do good for Tahoe.”
Combating climate change has become one of Brown’s top political crusades during his final term as California governor, and he used his appearance Wednesday to highlight California’s efforts to slash greenhouse gas emissions and invest in renewable energy.
Last week, California lawmakers approved legislation to cut greenhouse gas emissions to 40% below 1990 levels by 2030, a stiffer target than is in current law. Brown, who plans to sign the measures, gleefully proclaimed that oil companies and opponents of new environmental regulations were “vanquished.”
Still, Brown said that climate change continues to pose a significant threat in California and worldwide.
Tahoe’s surface water temperature in 2015 was the highest ever recorded. Annual snowfall levels in the nearby mountains have been on a steady decline, reducing the cool snowmelt that streams into the lake and replenishes its oxygen supply, said Geoffrey Schladow, director of the UC Davis Tahoe Environmental Research Center.
The increasing air temperatures in the Lake Tahoe region also have stressed the surrounding forests, causing an alarming increase in tree mortality that could lead to catastrophic wildfires, Schladow said. California officials say the state’s forests are pocked by more than 70 million dead trees, with the southern Sierra Mountains the hardest-hit.

“We’re in the midst of a change. I think it’s fair to say that climate change is the largest factor impacting Lake Tahoe — more than any other factor,” Schladow said. “Maybe this event will spark a resurgence and investment that we need.”
The Lake Tahoe area is home to only about 50,000 full-time residents, but those numbers swell by four times during the height of the summer and winter tourist seasons. That puts more cars on the road, increasing carbon emissions and the pollutants they leave behind.
Obama’s Tahoe appearance was the first leg on a swing through the Pacific and China to address the threats posed by climate change.
Earlier in the day, the White House announced a series of new funding and environmental programs to address the deteriorating health and water quality of Lake Tahoe and the surrounding forests.
The Department of the Interior will provide $29.5 million to reduce dead trees and other hazardous fuels in hopes of improving forest health and decreasing the threat of catastrophic wildfires and the Environmental Protection Agency will provide $230,000 in funds to manage and reduce storm water runoff in the Tahoe region.

Body of Las Vegas woman found in Death Valley National Park,https://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-ln-death-valley-heat-death-20160831-snap-story.html,2016-08-31,"In what appears to be the second heat-related fatality in Death Valley National Park this year, the body of a motorist was found Sunday five miles from a little-used road.
Linda Pi-Wei Hung, 40, of Las Vegas, was last heard from Saturday afternoon on her way from that city to Ft. Irwin, authorities said. County and federal search teams using two helicopters started scouring the desert north of Baker early Sunday afternoon.
At 2:30 p.m., they found Hung’s vehicle along Harry Wade Road, a lonely dirt road in the park’s southern end, according to the National Park Service. Rangers speculate that Hung started walking across the baking desert after her vehicle got stuck in the sand while she was attempting to turn around. The day’s high was 113 degrees.
An autopsy has not yet been performed but the San Bernardino County Coroner’s Office said it appears Hung died of heat exposure.
On June 9, when temperatures in Death Valley climbed to 118 degrees, visitors found the body of Reinhard Egger, 60, a German citizen, near his motorcycle. It was parked upright on Harry Wade Road and was still functional. The Inyo County Coroner’s Office found that Egger had died from overheating.
Earlier this month, a 56-year-old woman died of heat-related causes while hiking with her family in Joshua Tree National Park.
Every year, one or two people die of heat exposure in Death Valley, said park management assistant Abby Wines.
It was unknown if Hung had water, but Wines said people can succumb to Death Valley’s soaring temperatures even if they have enough to drink.
If stranded, she added, the best thing visitors can do is stay with their vehicle, which offers shade and can be easily spotted by search teams.

The blaze that won’t die: How Monterey County wildfire became one of costliest to fight,https://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-ln-soberanes-fire-20160926-snap-htmlstory.html,2016-09-30,"Dean Riddle of the Mill Valley, Calif., Fire Department hikes through trees blanketed with fire retardant after battling the Soberanes fire in Monterey County.

Growing up in the scenic Carmel Valley Village, Vanessa Radley has seen her share of fires spread across the picturesque mountains and ranch land east of Big Sur.
But the blaze burning through the rough terrain has left even the most resilient Monterey County residents rattled and on guard.
She and thousands of others in the coastal hillside have spent a good chunk of their summer dodging the Soberanes fire, a blaze that simply will not die. California has seen larger and more destructive fires, but the Soberanes fire has become infamous because of the myriad difficulties firefighters have faced in trying to tame the out-of-control inferno.
With hundreds of firefighters on the lines for two months now, it has become one of the most expensive wildfires in U.S. history, costing at least $229 million, officials said.
Moving through nearly impossible-to-access terrain and fed by drought-shriveled fuels that are all but desperate to burn, the Soberanes fire has swallowed up more than 126,000 acres and destroyed several dozen homes since it was sparked by an illegal campfire on July 22, officials said.
“We’ve never had that feeling of ‘we’re out of the woods,’” said Cmdr. Bob Moses, who heads the Monterey County Sheriff’s Department’s SWAT team and has been involved in fire operations.
That leaves people like Radley on edge, not sure when wind gusts might send the fire surging back in her direction. She knows other communities have been evacuated in the middle of the night, and Radley said she’s been doing laundry nearly every day to ensure her family is ready to flee.
“I make sure to have the phone by the bed at night,” she says with a nervous smile.
Radley’s home is located near what firefighters hope to be one of the last battlegrounds in a two-month struggle.
The stubbornness of the Soberanes fire is the latest sign of how years of drought have contributed to a difficult fire season. Major fires across the state — in Lake and Kern counties, along the San Diego County border with Mexico and in the Cajon Pass area near San Bernardino, have destroyed hundreds of homes and left six people dead. Fire officials said the situation could get worse as Santa Ana winds pick up in Southern California is the coming months.
From the beginning, the blaze has proved difficult to battle. When it started, firefighters had to hike nearly two miles just to access the flames lapping hungrily at brush near the Soberanes Creek Trail. As the blaze surged in size, growing between 5,000 and 6,000 acres each day during the first week, firefighters struggled to get in close enough to stop its advance.
“What ultimately creates containment lines is boots on the ground. There’s a misconception that aerial operations extinguish fires,” said Steve Kliest, a spokesman for the Soberanes fire response. “We have essentially a giant campfire that will not be penetrated completely by air resources.”
In ideal conditions, firefighters would be able to approach the blaze directly and battle the flames just feet from the body of the fire. But the steep rocky ridges of the Los Padres National Forest and Garrapato State Park, where the bulk of the fire has burned, have made direct access nearly impossible for hand crews. Aside from the difficulty of getting personnel near the body of the fire, the treacherous slopes also make it tough for firefighters to escape  if the flames advance toward them.
Containing the fire has been less about battling the blaze up close and more about trapping it, officials said. Response teams have strategically set fire to swaths of dry grass and cut down patches of trees that would allow the blaze to travel toward more populated areas. Last week, officials were hopeful that a final so-called “burnout” along the ridges over Arroyo Seco would pin the fire inside the forest, where it can be monitored until rains come and completely extinguish it later this year.
While firefighters had planned to use strategic burns to keep the fire away from Arroyo Seco, officials said a favorable weather shift last weekend allowed firefighters to get in close and establish containment lines by directly attacking the blaze. Evacuation warnings for the Arroyo Seco area were lifted on Monday, officials said.
While the fire is mostly confined to wilderness now, it was far more destructive in its early days. From July 22 to July 30, more than 50 homes were destroyed along the Palo Colorado Canyon near the Pacific Coast Highway and in the Carmel Highlands. A bulldozer operator, Robert Reagan, was killed in an accident while working on a rugged slope, fire officials said.
Some officials have described the fire as the most expensive the U.S. Forest Service has ever fought. But Jennifer Jones, a spokeswoman for the National Interagency Fire Center, said that’s likely not true because those figures don’t account for inflation. Firefighting equipment, the cost of setting up base camps for firefighters around the county and the sheer duration of the blaze have driven up costs, according to Elaine Briggs, a spokeswoman for the California Interagency Management Team that has overseen much of the blaze.
The cost of just the firefighting equipment being used is roughly $69 million, according to Briggs. Officials also have had to house firefighters in four camps — with laundry facilities, sleeping quarters, showers and other necessities — which Briggs said accounted for roughly 32% of the entire bill.
The fire has advanced toward sparsely populated areas since then, which has helped minimize threats to property and public safety, but also made the blaze even tougher to battle.
An acrid smoke odor hangs thick in the air along Chews Ridge, a mountain peak near the Tassajara Hot Springs resort that provides one of the best points to see the massive ash cloud rising from the belly of the fire. A series of surprise wind gusts caught firefighters off guard last week, launching embers toward Chews Ridge and creating a second fire that burned several hundred acres while first responders were in the midst of a shift change, said Brentwood Reid, another spokesman for the firefighting effort.
The secondary fire was sparked deep in a valley where there is little to no space for a helicopter to land, meaning firefighters had to hike down extremely steep ridges and along ground that tends to shift underfoot as they walk.
“This is just unforgiving country,” said Jake Cagle, a Kern County fire captain on hand to battle the blaze.
While the fire has caused pockets of panic whenever it approaches an area where homes may be threatened, most Monterey County residents seem confident that  fire crews have it penned inside the forest.
And tourists and locals can be seen perusing the shops and restaurants along Monte Verde Street, one of Carmel-by-the-Sea’s main thoroughfares, as if oblivious to the hint of charcoal in the air and smoke cloud hanging over heads. Signs praising the firefighters’ efforts are ubiquitous along Carmel Valley Road, while a simple message of “Thxs Heros” is painted in grafitti stylings along a mountain ridge lining the scenic Laureles Grade Pass.
Another kind of drought: Inmate fire crews dwindle as wildfire season grows ever longer »
Jenny Angier, a waitress at the Running Iron restaurant in Carmel Valley where many firefighters enjoy a meal between shifts, said she’s less concerned about the fire’s advance and more about the long-term effects of the blaze. The fire destroyed several hiking trails and closed large swaths of state park land along the coast, which blunted tourism revenues in the area and put some locals out of work. The weeks spent breathing in smoke have also tested her patience at times.
“I have asthma. I’ve been using my medication more than I ever have in my entire life,” she said.
Other residents say panic has followed the path of the fire. Ernie Long, a 58-year-old mediator from Sacramento who spends his weekends at a home in the Carmel Valley Village area, remembers the fear he felt as the fire advanced toward his one-story ranch home on Paso Hondo Road in July. Ash rained down on Long’s home while firefighters remained stationed on a nearby baseball diamond, a last line of defense between his home and tongues of hungry yellow flames.
“If the fire had come over this ridge, there would have been absolutely no way to stop it,” Long said, pointing out his living room window to a row of houses that would have served as tinder.
The fire has moved in the opposite direction in recent weeks, moving southeast toward Arroyo Seco. But the mere sight of fire can still stoke fear in the community. Last week, crews burned away grass and other fuels on a mountain ridge to stop the fire’s advance, and smoke clouds wafted into the Carmel Valley again, causing Long to wonder if he was in danger for a second time.
“When they did that burn it was like ‘Oh, lord,’” Long said. “Is it coming back?”

Man gets prison and must pay $61 million for starting huge fire in the Sequoia National Forest,https://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-ln-man-arrested-starting-cedar-fire-20160929-snap-story.html,2016-09-30,"Hours after federal prosecutors filed charges against him, a Mexican national pleaded guilty Thursday to starting a wildfire that recently burned more than 45 square miles in the Sequoia National Forest.
A federal judge sentenced Angel Gilberto Garcia-Avalos, 29, to 13 months in prison and ordered him to pay $61 million in restitution for damage caused by the Cedar fire, according to the U.S. attorney’s office.
Garcia-Avalos, a resident of Michoacan, Mexico, was driving off-road illegally Aug. 16 when his Nissan Maxima got stuck on a berm and his catalytic converter and muffler ignited dead grass.
The fire swiftly spread and burned 29,322 acres in Kern and Tulare counties, according to Acting U.S. Atty. Phillip A. Talbert. Flames destroyed six homes and triggered mandatory evacuations of several communities in both counties.
Prosecutors charged Garcia-Avalos with one count of causing a fire to burn in the forest and two counts of giving false information to a forest officer.
At his first court appearance Thursday in Bakersfield, he entered the guilty plea and was sentenced. While imposing the penalty, U.S. Magistrate Judge Jennifer L. Thurston commented that Garcia-Avalos exhibited “significant negligence” and made no effort to get help after the blaze erupted.
Prosecutors say Garcia-Avalos turned off a highway onto a rough dirt road in the forest and he got stuck as he tried to drive over the berm. When the car rolled back and hit a tree, the hot muffler and catalytic converter touched tall, dead grass and sparked the fast-moving blaze.
Ranchers spotted Garcia-Avalos carrying his 4-year-old son on his shoulders west of the Cedar Creek Campground area, where the fire had been reported, according to a U.S. District Court complaint. They suspected he started the fire and offered to help, but he said he was OK. Still, ranchers recorded the conversation with an iPhone.
Garcia-Avalos told the ranchers that his car had been stolen and that his son saw the man who took it, and that he was walking home to Delano, which is more than 42 miles away from the Cedar Creek area, according to an affidavit written by U.S. Forest Service Special Agent Brian Adams.
The ranchers were able to convince Garcia-Avalos to enter their home so that he could call someone for help. During the visit, they asked him several questions about the fire, and Garcia-Avalos denied responsibility, prosecutors say.
At the crash site, fire investigators found a burned vehicle and shoe prints belonging to a small child and an adult. The shoe prints led investigators from the car to Highway 155. Tire tracks found at the scene indicated that the driver tried several times to make it up a hill before the car hit the tree.
According to federal prosecutors, Garcia-Avalos lied to a Forest Service official about driving through the forest and having his car stolen.
Garcia-Avalos told the investigator that he and his son had gone to the mountains to “watch the view” and that he had gone to retrieve water when his son yelled out that a man with long hair was stealing the car, according to the affidavit. Garcia-Avalos agreed to have his and his son’s shoes photographed and taken for evidence.
Garcia-Avalos reported Aug. 29 to his probation office and was detained for deportation proceedings. Garcia-Avalos has previously been convicted of burglary, stealing a car and traffic violations, according to court documents. He told investigators that he entered the U.S. illegally.

What you need to know about the FBI’s new inquiry into emails that might be related to Hillary Clinton,https://www.latimes.com/nation/ct-clinton-emails-fbi-faq-20161030-story.html,2016-10-31,"FBI Director James B. Comey’s announcement Friday that his agency wasinvestigatingnewly found emails that might be related to Hillary Clinton’s use of a private server sent shock waves through the presidential campaign in its final days.
A letter from Comey announcing the new probe rekindled a politically damaging controversy that has dogged Clinton since she launched her campaign last year.
Here is some of what we know so far and what we don’t.
Not much. In a three-paragraph letter to members of Congress, Comey, who has served as FBI director since 2013, said newly discovered emails could be relevant to questions of whether Clinton and her aides mishandled classified information while she was secretary of State. He offered no details about the messages themselves and said he could not predict how long it would take for the FBI to determine whether they were relevant.
No. In July, the Justice Departmentdeclined to file chargesin the case, based on Comey’s recommendation. He concluded that although Clinton had been “extremely careless” in her use of a private email account while at the State Department, there was no “clear evidence that Secretary Clinton or her colleagues intended to violate laws governing the handling of classified information.”
The FBI came across the emails while investigating whether Anthony Weiner, a former New York congressman, violated federal law when exchanging sexually explicit texts with a teenage girl in North Carolina, a federal law enforcement official said.
His estranged wife, Huma Abedin, is one of Hillary Clinton’s top aides. The two of them shared the computer that the emails were found on, law enforcement officials said.
It’s unclear. Comey was vague, saying that the FBI “cannot yet assess whether or not this material may be significant.” However, a federal official told The Times that the emails examined so far were not to or from Clinton, and that they contained information that appeared to be more of what agents had already uncovered.
He told bureau employees in an email Friday that he felt compelled to be transparent after announcing in July and testifying on Capitol Hill that the investigation was over. “I also think it would be misleading to the American people were we not to supplement the record,” he wrote.
The campaign is urging Comey to be even more transparent. Robby Mook, Clinton’s campaign manager, said Comey “owes the public the full story, or he shouldn’t have cracked open the door in the first place.” Clinton herself has called Comey’s letter “deeply troubling.”
Democrats and Republicans alike are also asking for more information. Indiana Gov. Mike Pence, Donald Trump’s vice presidential running mate, tweeted that the FBI should “immediately release all emails pertinent to their investigation. Americans have the right to know before election day.”
Moreover,four Senate Democrats, including California Sen. Dianne Feinstein, the ranking member on the Senate Intelligence Committee, wrote that more information must be made public in regard to the new investigation.
“The letter is troubling because it is vaguely worded and leaves so many questions unanswered,” the senators wrote. The letter is also troubling because it breaks with the longstanding tradition of Department of Justice and the FBI exercising extreme caution in the days leading up to an election, so as not to unfairly influence the results.
While she was secretary of State, Clinton used a personal email address to conduct government business. The messages were stored on her family’s personal server in the basement of her home in Chappaqua, N.Y. Clinton has said she used the account because she didn’t want to carry two devices for personal and State Department communications. Other officials have said the State Department’s official email system was cumbersome and difficult to use.
Clinton has since said that using a private server was a mistake and “not the best choice.”
Clinton has said if she could do it over again, she would not have used a personal email server while at the State Department. The issue has continued to create headaches for the campaign. On Sunday, Podesta, Clinton’s campaign chairman, said she did not give it much thought back then and it’s been a hindrance.
“It’s the kind of a decision that I think needed more thought, more review, and she didn’t do it. And she regrets that,”he saidon CNN.

"Rain finally comes to fire-ravaged Tennessee — along with tornadoes, mudslides and the threat of floods",https://www.latimes.com/nation/ct-tornadoes-fires-tennessee-20161130-story.html,2016-11-30,"Smoke surrounds a home as seen from aboard a National Guard helicopter near Gatlinburg, Tenn. Thousands of people have fled deadly wildfires that have destroyed hundreds of homes and a resort in the Great Smoky Mountains.

Reporting from Atlanta —At long last, rain fell on the scorched Appalachian town of Gatlinburg, Tenn., on Wednesday after savage wildfires blazed across eastern Tennessee, killing seven people, forcing thousands to evacuate and burning hundreds of homes to the ground.
Yet even as rainstorms helped firefighters douse the smoldering mountain resort town, which attracts 11 million tourists a year, they brought new threats to the drought-afflicted Southeast: mudslides, heavy winds, lightning, flooding, even tornadoes.
On Wednesday morning, the National Weather Service issued a flood advisory for Gatlinburg and surrounding Sevier County as search-and-rescue teams went door-to-door, scouring charred hills and ridges for anyone who might have been left behind.
Across the region, Tuesday night storms wreaked havoc in rural communities, spawning devastating winds and tornadoes that killed five people, injured dozens more, and flattened homes, churches, gas stations and grocery stores.
A married couple was killed in Polk County in southern Tennessee. Three people perished when a tornado demolished a mobile home in the small town of Rosalie, in northeastern Alabama. Five miles east, a day-care center in Ider, Ala., was destroyed, leaving four children in critical condition.
“We don’t usually get tornadoes this time of year,” said Chief Deputy Rocky Harnen of Jackson County, Ala., where 50 buildings were damaged or destroyed. “But this has not been a normal weather year.”
Wildfires have been spreading for weeks in the Southeast, where a severe drought persists. As many as 20 large fires are blazing across 142,000 acres, according to Adam Rondeau, a spokesman for the U.S. Forest Service, who described the unusually parched conditions as creating the “perfect storm” for wildfires.
On Wednesday, small brush fires continued to erupt around Gatlinburg, about 40 miles southeast of Knoxville. Yet officials said heavy rain was helping firefighters extinguish some of the fires.
“We’re thankful to the big guy from above for that rain, that’s for sure,” Sevier County Mayor Larry Waters said.
Yet the rain was also posing new challenges, creating small mudslides and rockslides, Gatlinburg Fire Chief Greg Miller said.
“The rain may help to prevent some of the further brush fires,” he said. “But unless that rain penetrates deep enough into that leaf clutter, then those hot spots can still arise.”
The fires first threatened neighborhoods Monday night. High winds swept eastern Tennessee, blowing embers from a wildfire on Chimney Tops mountain into Gatlinburg, the gateway to Great Smoky Mountains National Park.
Local officials and residents in the town were taken aback by how swiftly the fires spread as winds ignited new areas and knocked power lines down onto dry autumn leaves. In a span of 15 minutes, the fire chief said, emergency workers were alerted to almost 20 burning buildings.
“You know, it happened so fast, it was staggering,” said Gatlinburg Mayor Mike Werner, who lost his two-story home as well as the condominium business he has managed for 31 years. “When you’ve got winds of up to 87 mph pushing fire, people were basically running for their lives.”
Michael Luciano, who lives in Chalet Village, west of downtown Gatlinburg, recorded on cellphone video hisharrowing journeydown a narrow mountain road in a pickup, past flaming orange trees and cabins. (Warning, video contains profanity.)
“Hit the gas,” he screamed at his brother, Anthony Fulton, as red flames engulfed both sides of the road and embers bounced off the windshield. Their frightened dog can be heard panting in the background
Smoke filled their truck as they hurtled past blazing, burned-out structures. “No warning, nothing,” Luciano said. “… Almost every cabin in Chalet Village is burning to the freakin’ ground!”
Dozens of guests and staff found themselves trapped inside the Park Vista, a modern, high-rise hotel perched on a ridge above downtown Gatlinburg. Some fled outside with their luggage, only to find the sole road to safety blocked by fallen trees and flames.
“Then the flames came up into the parking lot,” Logan Baker, a hotel guest, told WBIR-TV.
As Baker and his aunt frantically tried to help guests back inside, he said, embers started flying through the doors and into the hotel. Firefighters barricaded the hotel and urged guests to huddle in the center of the smoke-filled lobby as they worked to beat the fire back from the building.
Two days later, some Gatlinburg residents continued to search frantically for loved ones.
The last time Michael Reed, a maintenance safety trainer at the theme park Dollywood, spoke to his wife, Constance, was Monday evening. He and his son became stuck in traffic as they tried to drive home. As fires engulfed their neighborhood, Constance, who was with their two daughters, called to tell him flames were shooting across the street.
“I told them to call 911 and get out, and that was the last I heard from them,” he told the Knoxville News Sentinel on Wednesday.
Across Gatlinburg and surrounding Sevier County, more than 700 structures were damaged or destroyed – from the Sleepy Bear Motel to Cupid’s Chapel of Love, a tiny wedding venue.
State Highway 441 into Gatlinburg remained closed, and more than 14,000 residents and tourists were evacuated. At least 53 people were taken to hospitals.
“This is a once-in-a-lifetime event, I’m hoping,” Waters said, noting that severe drought and strong winds had created unique conditions. “I’ve never seen anything even close to this in this county, and I don’t expect to see it again.”
Still, much of downtown and some major tourist attractions appeared to have been spared. More than 10,000 animals at Ripley’s Aquarium of the Smokies in Gatlinburg remained safe, even though staff had been forced to evacuate Monday. In nearby Pigeon Forge, some cabins at Dollywood — co-owned by country singer Dolly Parton, who is from the area — were damaged or destroyed, but the park remained unscathed after firefighters dug a fire line.
With more than 10,000 people without power, emergency workers spent much of Wednesday clearing mudslides, debris and power lines. Even amid the rain, firefighters were called that afternoon to extinguish a new fire.
“We’re still working,” Miller said. “This is going to be a process that takes time.”

Across Gatlinburg and surrounding Sevier County, more than 700 structures were damaged or destroyed – from the Sleepy Bear Motel to Cupid’s Chapel of Love, a tiny wedding venue.
State Highway 441 into Gatlinburg remained closed, and more than 14,000 residents and tourists were evacuated. At least 53 people were taken to hospitals.
“This is a once-in-a-lifetime event, I’m hoping,” Waters said, noting that severe drought and strong winds had created unique conditions. “I’ve never seen anything even close to this in this county, and I don’t expect to see it again.”
Still, much of downtown and some major tourist attractions appeared to have been spared. More than 10,000 animals at Ripley’s Aquarium of the Smokies in Gatlinburg remained safe, even though staff had been forced to evacuate Monday. In nearby Pigeon Forge, some cabins at Dollywood — co-owned by country singer Dolly Parton, who is from the area — were damaged or destroyed, but the park remained unscathed after firefighters dug a fire line.
With more than 10,000 people without power, emergency workers spent much of Wednesday clearing mudslides, debris and power lines. Even amid the rain, firefighters were called that afternoon to extinguish a new fire.
“We’re still working,” Miller said. “This is going to be a process that takes time.”

3 dead as wildfires roar through Great Smoky Mountains,https://www.latimes.com/nation/nationnow/la-na-deep-south-severe-weather-20161129-story.html,2016-11-29,"Reporting from PIGEON FORGE, Tenn. —Wildfires fueled by high winds roared through parts of the Great Smoky Mountains, burning the doorstep of the Dollywood theme park, destroying a resort and chasing thousands of people from their homes.
National Guard troops arrived Tuesday to help overwhelmed firefighters, and Mother Nature provided a little relief as the winds calmed and rain fell in some areas. Forecasters said it would not be enough to end the relentless drought that has spread across the South and set the stage over the past few weeks for wildfires in Tennessee, Georgia and North Carolina.
The latest wildfires grew Monday night when high winds blew trees onto power lines, sparking new fires and spreading embers over long distances, officials said.
“There were times last night that we had wind gusts in excess of 87 miles an hour. That is hurricane force. That is nowhere to be when trying to fight a fire,” Gatlinburg Fire Chief Greg Miller said at a news conference Tuesday.
Hundreds of homes and other buildings, including a 16-story hotel, were damaged or destroyed by flames.
Emergency officials ordered evacuations in downtown Gatlinburg and Pigeon Forge and in other areas of Sevier County near the Great Smoky Mountains. About 14,000 residents and visitors were evacuated from Gatlinburg alone.
About 1,200 people took shelter at the Gatlinburg Community Center and the Rocky Top Sports Park and several other shelters. TV news broadcasts showed residents streaming out of town just as rain started to wet roads.
At least a dozen people were taken to hospitals, including some with burns. No deaths were reported and officials said they had not received any reports of missing people.
Sevier County Mayor Larry Waters said three people had died in the wildfires. The mayor said authorities were going door-to-door to make sure everyone was safe.
In downtown Gatlinburg, workers at Ripley’s Aquarium of the Smokies had to flee because of the wildfires and left behind more than 10,000 fish and other animals. So far, the building appeared OK.
“The aquarium, as far as we looked at this morning, was intact,” Waters said. “I understand that they had a generator so they were able to do what they needed to do to protect the animals.”
Based on preliminary surveys, the Westgate Smoky Mountain Resort & Spa in Gatlinburg “is likely entirely gone,” the Tennessee Emergency Management Agency said in a news release. The agency had previously said that the Ober Gatlinburg amusement park and ski area had reportedly been destroyed as well, but later said resort officials had checked in and said the property was fine.
Officials with Dollywood, the amusement park named after country music icon Dolly Parton, said the theme park in Pigeon Forge wasn’t damaged, but more than a dozen cabins operated by the park had been.
Dollywood suspended operations at least through Wednesday. Its DreamMore resort will be open on a limited basis as a shelter and for registered guests.
Just hours before the fires spread, the singer appeared in a video to urge people to prevent forest fires.
Parton appears with Smokey Bear in the 30-second video released Sunday by Great Smoky Mountains National Park. She tells people to avoid burning leaves and parking vehicles on dry grass, and warns that campfires can spark wildfires.
Parton is a native of Sevier County, which includes both Gatlinburg and Pigeon Forge.
Rain showers ended in the Gatlinburg area about 8 a.m. Tuesday, said National Weather Service meteorologist Sam Roberts. No more meaningful rainfall was expected until about midnight Tuesday, and would last through Wednesday.
After weeks of punishing drought, any rain should be soaked up quickly, forecasters said. Rainfall amounts have been 10 to 15 inches below normal during the past three months in many parts of the South.
“I think we racked up deficits that are going to be too much to overcome with just one storm system,” said Mark Svoboda, director of the National Drought Mitigation Center in Lincoln, Neb.
In Mississippi, trees were reported down Monday in nearly 20 counties across the state. Sustained winds of 30 to 40 mph — with gusts of more than 50 mph — were reported and more than 2 inches of rain fell in some areas.
Power outages peaked at more than 23,000 in Mississippi. Power lines downed by winds sparked grass fires in four counties, said Greg Flynn, a spokesman for the Mississippi Emergency Management Agency.

"Humans spark 84 percent of American wildfires, study finds",https://www.latimes.com/science/sd-me-human-wildfires-20170227-story.html,2017-02-27,"People have started 84 percent of U.S. wildfires and 97 percent of wildfires in coastal California and the Central Valley,according to a new studyled by scientists at the University of Colorado Boulder.
Human-started fires nationwide accounted for 44 percent of the total area of 89,339,131 acres burned over the last two decades.
These fires have vastly expanded the area burnt and the extent of the fire season, the researchers say. Intentionally set managed burns and agricultural fires were excluded from the study.
In California’s Mediterranean climate region, 89 percent of the total 5,921,861 acres burned was caused by human-started wildfires. The region extends along the California coast from the Mexican border north to San Francisco, and inland to the Central Valley.
“Human-started wildfires accounted for 84 percent of all wildfires, tripled the length of the fire season, dominated an area seven times greater than that affected by lightning fires, and were responsible for nearly half of all area burned,” stated the study. (Area measurements, given in hectares by the study, were converted to acres for this article).
One of the biggest wildfires in recent Southern California history, the 2003 Cedar Fire in San Diego County, was started by a lost hunter,who said it was meant as a signal but got out of control.
Other large fires in California have been sparked by causes includingarcing power lines,arson, lit cigarettes, fireworks or childrenplaying with fire.
Results were published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. Jennifer K. Balch led the study, with Adam L. Mahood as senior author. It can be found atj.mp/humanfires.
Using federal and state records from 1992 to 2012, the team found that people added more than 40,000 wildfires a year across the United States.
July 4 was the most common day for human-started fires, with a total of 7,762 starting that day over the study’s 21-year period. The most common day for lightning-started fires was July 22nd.
Removing the fuel
Wildfires play an important natural role in the ecosystem, said Balch, director of CU Boulder’s Earth Lab. Moreover, and suppressing them has unintended bad effects, such as making the fires that eventually occur even more devastating.
“There are good fires and there’s bad fires,” Balch said. “This study looks at the wildfires that required some sort of suppression or emergency response. But there’s a lot of room for us to start the right kinds of fires; the prescribed fires, the controlled burns that many ecosystems, particularly in the Western states, need in order to be healthy ecosystems.”
Getting public support for increasing controlled burns is “a tricky problem,” Balch said.
“People don’t like smoke, and we don’t like the risk of a fire burning in our neighborhood,” she said. “But we’re already living with that risk, because we’re putting houses and people in flammable landscapes.
“We tried the failed experiment for over 100 years of suppressing fire and trying to get fire out,” Balch said. “And we didn’t win that war.”
Humans and climate
Humans have caused increasing numbers of large wildfires occurring in the spring, the study said. In the summer, increasing numbers of wildfires were largely driven by lightning.
A warmer climate in recent decades has helped extend the potential range of the fire season in the Western states, Balch said. But humans literally set the spark.
“People are providing the ignition during this longer fire season, and also contributing to large fires,” Balch said. “It’s not either people or climate, it’s both.”
It’s unclear what the future holds with regard to climate.
Scientific studies have found that global warmingappears to have gone into hiatus. The matter is indispute. Some scientists say there isno hiatus, while others say the hiatus exists, but isa natural pause.
And this year, a former federal climate scientist alleged that some of his peersmanipulated the scientific process to exaggerate warming. They have denied the claim.
Projections indicate that global warming will resume. By the end of the century, the number of lightning strikes is expected to increase by 50 percent due to global warming, the study stated.
But even if that happens, “humans would still remain the dominant ignition source across the majority of the United States land area,” the study stated.

Southern California is blanketed by the smell of wildfires; here’s the latest,https://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-ln-california-wildfires-latest-20170629-htmlstory.html,2017-06-30,"Wildfires broke out in Southern California along the edges of the Los Angeles Basin and the Orange County coastline.
Southern California woke to the acrid smell of smoke and ash Thursday morning as additional wildfires broke out along the edges of the Los Angeles Basin and Orange County coastline.
Combined with other blazes that ignited earlier in the week, at least half a dozen wildfires have filled the air with a pungent odor long associated with fire season, when hot temperatures and strong winds turn sparks into brush fires.
The scene was particularly noticeable Thursday because an inversion layer had settled over the region, trapping the fumes.
California’s landscape is vulnerable to fast fires as the wettest winter in more than a decade helped lay down a thick carpet of grass that withers rapidly in summer heat.
The fires stretch from San Luis Obispo County in the north toCamp Pendletonin the south and Riverside County in the east. Here is the status of the most recent wildfires:
Flames that tore through the northwestern part of Camp Pendleton slowly moved into San Clemente overnight and have burned an estimated 760 acres, the Orange County Fire Authority said Thursday.
Location
San Diego/Orange counties
Acreage
760
Containment
70%
The fire was reported about 6:15 p.m. Wednesday when it was already 15 acres and growing near the San Mateo Campground and Cristianitos Road, according to Camp Pendleton officials.
Officials said the blaze, dubbed the Cristianitos fire, was heading away from the Marine base and was just east of Richard T. Steed Memorial Park, a recreation area next to a cluster of businesses and a golf course.
Crews lit backfires on three sides of the fire overnight to limit its spread, said fire Capt. Larry Kurtz. Backfires are used to burn fuel in the fire’s path.
The western face of the fire closest to homes is protected by extra firefighters, Kurtz said.
“The fire has slowed to a crawl. There is no wind, which is a huge benefit to us,” Kurtz said.
The fire is moving based on topography, making its behavior somewhat predictable. The biggest challenge has been how fast it moves.
“During the winter we had heavy rains create a very large grass crop throughout California.… It’s a less intense fire but one that moves very quickly,” Kurtz said.
The fire was 70% contained as of Thursday night.
In Calabasas, firefighters were trying to control a fire that quickly swelled to 40 to 50 acres.

Located near Malibu Canyon and Mulholland Drive, the so-called Stokes fire was reported about 3 p.m. Thursday and grew in the remote area with moderate winds.
By 4:30 p.m., more than 220 firefighters had stopped the forward progress of the flames. Late Thursday, the fire was 80% contained, according to theL.A. County Fire Department.
One firefighter suffered a heat-related injury, according to the Fire Department.
The Topanga fire was reported near Topanga Canyon Boulevard and Pacific Coast Highway.

TheLos Angeles County Fire Departmentsaid that about 25 acres had burned and that firefighters were ready to protect homes in the Malibu area if the fire grew.
As firefighters battled the blaze, motorists faced gridlocked traffic along Pacific Coast Highway and road closures.
TheCalifornia Highway Patrolsaid Topanga Canyon Boulevard was closed from Pacific Coast Highway to Grandview Drive until further notice.
A stretch of Pacific Coast Highway was closed during the afternoon and evening, but all lanes were reopened by 9 p.m., according to the CHP.
The Burbank fire broke out just before 3 p.m. Wednesday near Hamline Place, where it raced up a grassy slope and moved dangerously close to homes in the Verdugo Mountains and briefly triggered mandatory evacuations.

Authorities were concerned because houses “butt right up to the hillside,” Burbank Police Sgt. Derek Green told KNBC-TV Channel 4.
“It was a fast-moving fire,” Green said. “This is a very dry area.”
Television news footage showed thick black smoke and tennis courts burning.
About 15 fire engines responded to the three-alarm blaze, Burbank Fire Battalion Chief Ron Barone told KTLA-TV Channel 5. Five engines were dedicated just to protecting homes, he said.
The fire spread across 10 acres but did not grow overnight, Barone said. The fire was between 85% and 90% contained Thursday morning, he said.
“Our plan calls for nobody to be on the fire line by 7 tonight,” Barone said. “There’s no push left in it.”
No structures were damaged in the fire, Barone said.
Immediately after the fire began, the Burbank Police Department ordered evacuations of all homes on Viewcrest Drive and Howard Court. Irving Drive was closed east of Kenneth Road, and Joaquin Drive was closed at Haven Way.
But by 8:30 p.m., all evacuations were lifted.
About 150 firefighters were assigned to the blaze, which helped to quickly halt the fire’s growth.
“Our incident commander saw the threat and pulled the trigger,” Barone said.
Given light winds and cooling temperatures, crews in Riverside County doubled the containment of the Manzanita fire to 90% by Thursday night. The fire has burned 6,309 acres, according to the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection.

Acreage

The blaze was sparked Monday by a car crash along Highway 79 in the San Jacinto Mountains and was fueled by high temperatures, low humidity and wind gusts of up to 35 mph.
Residents in areas like Poppet Flats and Silent Valley spent more than a day under an evacuation warning in which they needed to be prepared to flee if the winds changed and the flames ran down the hills toward their homes. Those warnings were finally lifted Wednesday.
More than 700 firefighters are continuing to work to fully contain the fire and knock down any smoldering hot spots, Cal Fire said.
On Tuesday night, another blaze erupted east of San Bernardino and fewer than 30 miles north of the Manzanita fire.
Location
San Bernardino County
Acreage
670
Containment
60%
The Mart fire raced up a steep canyon in the San Bernardino Mountains around 3:15 p.m. Its flames came within feet of igniting a suburban hillside neighborhood and forced residents of roughly 200 homes to evacuate.
Firefighters managed to stop its advance with aircraft and ground crews and lifted evacuation orders a few hours later. Highway 330 was reopened Wednesday.
The fire started near a Wal-Mart at Highland Avenue and Highway 330, a popular thoroughfare that leads to Big Bear.
Reconnaissance flights caused authorities to reduce the estimated size of the blaze. The fire is 670 acres and 60% contained, the U.S. Forest Service said Thursday night.
About 125 firefighters were assigned to the blaze as of Thursday, and the cause is under investigation.
In San Luis Obispo County, the Hill fire started Monday and has burned 1,598 acres. On Thursday, it was 88% contained, Cal Fire said.
The blaze was burning along the eastern foothills of a coastal mountain range near Santa Margarita, among secluded homes and tall, dry grass.

Crews spent Wednesday shoring up defensive lines around the fire, including cutting down swaths of trees to create a fuel break for the flames. All road closures in the area have been lifted.
Four homes were destroyed in the fire. According to TMZ, “Big Bang Theory” actor Johnny Galecki’s ranch was among the properties charred by flames.
In a statement to the website, Galecki said: “My heart goes out to all in the area who are also experiencing loss from this vicious fire, the threat of which we live with constantly, which may seem crazy to some but we do so because living in our beautiful, rural area makes it worthwhile. It's never the structures that create a community — it's the people. And if the people of Santa Margarita have taught me anything it's that, once the smoke has cleared, literally and figuratively, it's a time to reach out and rebuild. We've done it before, and will need to do it together again, and it will make our community even closer and stronger. Endless thanks to Cal Fire and the Sheriff's Office. I know you guys are fighting the good fight to keep us safe. So very relieved no one has been hurt.""
The Placerita fire started Sunday afternoon when a motorist crashed into a tree, according to theLos Angeles County Fire Department.
The blaze burned 760 acres and was 95% contained by the end of Wednesday. Authorities anticipate having the blaze completely out by Thursday, officials said.
Location
Los Angeles County
Acreage

In its first hours over the weekend, the blaze had knocked out power and triggered mandatory evacuations for dozens of residents after it jumped the freeway and sent up a towering plume of gray smoke that was visible for miles.
At Golden Oak Ranch, an 890-acre filming location constructed by Disney and ABC studios, the fire burned a structure that had been used as a prop house, said L.A. County Sheriff's Department spokesman Christopher Craft.
U.S. Forest Service firefighters stopped the blaze from burning other structures in the faux business district and suburban street used for filming movies and television shows.
Cal Fireand theU.S. Forest Servicelist several other active fires burning in the state from San Diego to Modoc counties, the two largest of which were nearly contained Thursday at about 1,500 acres apiece.
About 2,300 wildfires on state and federal land have burned 26,000 acres so far in 2017, according to government statistics.

"Wildfires trigger evacuations in Lake Elsinore, injure firefighters in San Bernardino County",https://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-ln-wildfires-20170731-story.html,2017-08-01,"Two wildfires that broke out in Southern California on Monday scorched a total of about 300 acres in Lake Elsinore and Waterman Canyon, triggering evacuation orders and road closures.
The Rose fire, reported about 2:20 p.m., quickly burned about 200 acres in the foothills of Lake Elsinore, drawing a response from more than 200 firefighters and three helicopters, according to the Riverside County Fire Department.
About 8:10 p.m., Riverside County fire officials lifted all evacuation orders, which were in effect for several hours; an evacuation center was opened at Elsinore High School. Authorities warned motorists to drive through the fire area with caution.
Investigators determined the fire — which was 10% contained as of 9 p.m. — was caused “accidentally by equipment,” according to the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection. Further details were not available.

Meanwhile in San Bernardino County, the Mile fire scorched about 100 acres in Waterman Canyon and forced the closure of Highway 18 in both directions between 40th Avenue and Highway 138, according to the U.S. Forest Service. Officials did not indicate when the highway would reopen.
Nine firefighters were hospitalized with heat-related injuries.

Already suffering under a heat wave, Southern California faced intense summer storms that moved in Thursday afternoon, bringing lightning strikes that set off brush fires as well as intense downpours.
A 25-acre brush fire erupted near the 5 Freeway about 4:36 p.m. amid a lightning storm, said Fire Inspector Gustavo Medina, spokesman for the Los Angeles County Fire Department.
The blaze started as two smaller fires north of Lake Hughes Road and triggered the closure of the freeway’s northbound lanes, he said. There was no estimate for when lanes would be reopened.
About 3,400 lightning strikes have been reported since 1 p.m. in Los Angeles and Ventura counties.
“You should see it on my screen. It looks like a swarm of bees,” said Stuart Seto, a weather specialist for the National Weather Service in Oxnard.
In Santa Monica, city officials asked beachgoers to immediately evacuate all ocean areas and seek cover until the storm ended.
Triple-digit temperatures were the order of the day for many inland areas, and the weather service said numerous communities hit new high temperatures for the day, including Riverside and Ramona.
As thunderstorms moved through San Bernardino County to Los Angeles County, heavy rain pummeled parts of the Santa Clarita Valley, forecasters said.
In a tweet Thursday afternoon, the weather servicewarned residents, “Thunderstorms from Malibu to Santa Monica. People should leave the beaches and go indoors or in your cars immediately!!!”

Flash-flood warnings were issued for parts of the Inland Empire, including Riverside, Fontana and Rialto. Forecasters said lightning strikes were also likely.
Residents of Colton lost power Thursday after a lightning strike hit a power substation.
Even without the lightning, the heat continued to tax the power grid. The California Independent System Operator called for voluntary electricity conservation Friday.
In Boyle Heights, an estimated 11,000 residents were without power between Wednesday night and Thursday morning as high demand overloaded equipment to the point of failure. Power was restored by 6 a.m., officials said.
Southern California’s heat wave should peak by Friday. But in Northern California, triple-digit temperatures will be continue through the Labor Day weekend. This is sparking concerns because there are already more than a dozen wildfires burning in the Sierra Nevada, and smoke is settling onto the people in the valley below.

"Heat wave, winds and low humidity fuel wildfires across California",https://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-ln-fires-california-heatwave-20170831-story.html,2017-08-31,"As a blistering heat wave gripped California this week, firefighters statewide tackled massive wildfires that forced thousands of people to flee their homes.
Temperatures across California were expected to surpass the 100-degree mark Thursday as strong winds in the western half of the state triggered red flag warnings and posed a significant danger to firefighters.
Across the state, firefighters were battling 16 wildfires — some as small as 29 acres and as large as 68,400 acres.

In Butte County, more than 1,100 firefighters who are tackling the Ponderosa fire trudged through rugged woodlands east of Oroville in broiling temperatures, according to the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection.
“The heat does not work in our favor by any means,” said Paul Lowenthal, a Cal Fire spokesman.
Fire crews had hoped to make significant gains battling the blaze overnight, but weather conditions remained hot and dry.
The destructive wildfire, which is 10% contained, swelled to 3,500 acres overnight and continued to threaten hundreds of homes in its path. The fast-growing blaze has already destroyed 30 structures, including 10 homes near Feather Falls.
As flames inched closer to homes Wednesday, a new round of evacuation orders was given to residents living in the communities of Berry Creek, Brush Creek and Mountain House. Authorities estimated at least 1,500 residents received evacuation orders since the blaze started Tuesday afternoon, but not everyone has heeded the warnings, Lowenthal said.
Cal Fire said the blaze was started by an out-of-control campfire that was ignited outside a designated campground and allowed to escape.
John Ballenger, a 29-year-old Oroville resident, was arrested on suspicion of recklessly starting the campfire, Cal Fire said.
Elsewhere, firefighters were scrambling to get a handle on a massive wildfire in the Shasta-Trinity National Forest.
The Helena fire started just after 5 p.m. Wednesday about 59 miles northwest of Redding and scorched 5,000 acres. About 2,000 residents between the town of Helena and Oregon Mountain Summit were forced to flee as the blaze exploded amid terrain-driven winds, according to the U.S. Forest Service.

As the blaze burned along both sides of the Trinity River, firefighters also tackled flames along Highway 299, prompting authorities to close a portion of the road.
Meanwhile, the Forest Service also deployed a group of smoke jumpers, who parachuted into the burn area.
The cause of the fire was not known.
On the northern edge of California, the 64,400-acre Eclipse Complex fire was formed from at least four wildfires that were sparked by lightning on Aug. 15 in Klamath National Forest.
Burning in remote forestland, the wildfire is about 70 miles west of Yreka, Calif.

"Capitol Journal: Thanks to effective legislating, California lawmakers may soon pass affordable housing bills",https://www.latimes.com/politics/la-pol-sac-skelton-housing-deal-california-legislature-20170831-story.html,2017-08-31,"Reporting from Sacramento —Democrats are about to achieve one of their top priorities for this legislative session: passing bills to confront California’s affordable housing shortage.
It’s a two-year session and this is only the first year. So if the Legislature and Gov. Jerry Brown can pull off a housing victory in the next few days, as they expect, it’ll be relatively swift action and something to high-five about.
Already this year, the Legislature has passed Brown’s top two priorities: a fuel-tax increase to pay for major road repairs, and an extension of the state’s unique climate-fighting cap-and-trade program that requires polluters to buy permits to emit greenhouses gasses.
Those previous two measures — especially the unpopular gas tax hike — cost a steep political price for some vulnerable legislators who voted for them.
But regardless of how one might feel about any of these major bills, they show that the governor and Legislature are effectively legislating in Sacramento, unlike President Trump and Congress in Washington, D.C.
The California Legislature is no longer dysfunctional, and hasn’t been for a few years.
A big reason, although it hasn’t worked in Washington: one-party rule. California Democrats not only own the governorship (and every statewide office), they hold supermajorities in both legislative houses. That means they can pass anything, even if it requires a two-thirds vote.
And when there are Democratic opponents, Brown and legislative leaders have been able to compromise with enough Republicans to pass their bills. That’s the opposite of bitterly divided Republican Washington.
Other reasons for the increased functionality are reforms approved by voters in the last decade. Eliminating the two-thirds vote requirement for spending bills ended budget gridlocks. Institutional memories and legislating experience were improved by loosening term limits. Banning gerrymandered redistricting and creating open primaries added more election competition.
Changes to key housing bill will give local governments in California more control over the money>>
The pending housing legislation doesn’t mark a giant leap toward ending homelessness. Nor will it dramatically increase the stock of affordable houses for sale or rent near jobs in urban areas. But it does represent a modest, incremental step. Then later they can take another incremental step. And that’s about the only way to get things done in this polarized era.
“Does the current catastrophic housing shortage demand more public investment?” state Treasurer John Chiang asked rhetorically in response to the legislative deal. “Damn right it does, but politics is the art of the possible.”
Chiang, who’s running for governor, had urged a “big and bold” housing bond issue of up to $9 billion. But he calls the Democrats’ $4-billion housing bond proposal “a start” that “will still move the needle away from the current trend where more and more freeway underpasses and parks are becoming makeshift housing.”
And this week the bond plan received a very clever amendment: $1 billion targeted for the popular Cal-Vet Farm and Home Loan Program. Who can possibly be against helping a veteran buy a house?
The Cal-Vet amendment came from Assembly Speaker Anthony Rendon (D-Paramount), whose highest legislative priority is affordable housing.
California voters have approved Cal-Vet bonds 23 times over the decades. More than 423,000 veterans have obtained low-interest home loans. But there’s only $200 million left in the kitty.
The best feature about the program is that it costs taxpayers nothing. The bonds are paid off by the vets’ mortgage payments.
That’s not true for the remaining $3 billion in the bond proposal. That would be paid back with tax money.
Updates from Sacramento »
The bonds would be spent for several affordable housing programs, including construction of low-income rentals, high-density dwellings near transit and farmworker housing.
“Over the years, we’ve spent billions on housing programs — all of it for prisons and jails,” says Sen. Jim Beall (D-San Jose), the bond measure’s author. “There’s something wrong with that value system. We’re wising up.”
Before Brown would commit to signing a modest bond proposal for the 2018 ballot, he insisted on some regulatory reform that would expedite construction. That’s contained in a bill by Sen. Scott Wiener (D-San Francisco).
Wiener calls the lack of affordable housing “a contagion that is spreading like wildfire” across the state.
California lawmakers have tried for 50 years to fix the state’s housing crisis. Here’s why they’ve failed>>
Under his bill, the state would force local governments to streamline their planning and permitting for housing developments. But to appease organized labor, which sometimes clogs the development process to strong-arm concessions from builders, Wiener agreed to prevailing wage requirements. That generated opposition from builders.
The legislation “does not provide the substantive reforms we need to increase our housing supply for middle-class families,” says Rob Lapsley, president of the California Business Roundtable. “The dirty little secret is that some of the proposals make housing more expensive by supporting construction unions’ demands.”
But the Wiener bill requires only a simple majority vote for passage.
In bigger jeopardy is a funding measure by Sen. Toni Atkins (D-San Diego) that needs a two-thirds vote. It would raise $250 million a year for low-income housing by tacking a $75 fee on many real estate transactions, but not home sales.
Legislators are leery of anything that sounds like a tax increase.
But affordable housing has momentum and the governor’s blessing. Some legislation is bound to pass.
They’ve got one-party rule in Washington, too, at least on paper. But when it comes to legislating, no one is ruling.

"Growing wildfire east of Lake Oroville destroys 10 homes; 1,500 people told to flee",https://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-ln-ponderosa-fire-destroys-homes-butte-county-20170830-story.html,2017-08-30,"A fast-growing wildfire near Lake Oroville has destroyed 10 homes and triggered evacuation orders for 1,500 residents, fire officials said.
The Ponderosa fire erupted just after 1:10 p.m. Tuesday in a wooded and rugged area about two miles northwest of Forbestown, 21 miles east of Oroville, said Mary Ann Aldrich, spokeswoman for the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection in Butte County.
By Wednesday morning, the blaze, which started at 40 acres, swelled to 2,500 acres and had destroyed 30 structures, including homes near Feather Falls.
“It’s going to be a long fight because of the weather conditions,” she said.
Cal Fire said the blaze was started by a campfire that was ignited outside a designated campground and allowed to escape.
John Ballenger, a 29-year-old Oroville resident, was arrested on suspicion of recklessly starting the campfire, Cal Fire said.
“All campfires pose a risk of escaping,” county Fire Chief Darren Read said in a statement. “A campfire should never be left unattended and must be extinguished completely before everyone leaves.”
More than 900 firefighters were tackling flames burning in forest land. Dozens more firefighters statewide were heading to the remote area in Butte County to assist in the fight.
At one point Tuesday, conditions on the ground became so intense that a large pyrocumulus cloud formed and could be seen from as far away as Sacramento. So-called fire clouds develop over intense wildfires and are capable of generating lightning, wind and rain.
We can see pyrocumulus from#PonderosaFirenear Oroville from our office in Sacramento. Please follow orders from local officials!#CAwxpic.twitter.com/GmadK8mvsZ
As firefighters work to surround the blaze, they will face blistering temperatures and high humidity, mostly due to a strong high-pressure system that continues to linger over California.
Much of Northern California will be under an excessive-heat warning until Sept. 4, according to the National Weather Service in Sacramento.
Temperatures in Oroville could reach 100 degrees Wednesday, 107 on Thursday and 111 on Friday and Saturday.
Communities near Feather Falls will face broiling temperatures through the weekend. Temperatures could reach 103 on Friday and 102 on Saturday.

Trump lashes out at Puerto Ricans after mayor’s criticism of administration’s relief effort,https://www.latimes.com/nation/nationnow/la-na-puerto-rico-trump-mayor-20170930-story.html,2017-10-01,"Reporting from Washington —From the comfort of his New Jersey golf resort, President Trump lashed out Saturday at the mayor of San Juan, Puerto Rico, and the ravaged island’s residents, defending his administration’s hurricane response by suggesting that Puerto Ricans had not done enough to help themselves.
Trump’s Twitter assault, which began early Saturday and lasted until evening, was set off by criticism from Mayor Carmen Yulin Cruz, who on Friday had criticized the federal response since Hurricane Maria’s Sept. 20 landfall.
“Such poor leadership ability by the Mayor of San Juan, and others in Puerto Rico, who are not able to get their workers to help,” Trump tweeted. He added: “They want everything to be done for them when it should be a community effort. 10,000 federal workers now on island doing a fantastic job.”
The president’s comments were a breathtaking and racially inflected swipe at residents who have labored for more than a week to survive without electricity, running water, food or medical supplies. Media reports have shown residents in the city and villages sweltering in line for hours with gas cans, hoping for enough fuel to run generators. Nearly every hospital in Puerto Rico lost power in the hurricane, though many have crept toward a semblance of operation. Thousands of crates of supplies have arrived in Puerto Rico, but their distribution has been slowed by destroyed roads and trucks and a shortage of drivers to deliver the goods around the island.
Media reports also have shown Puerto Ricans working together, a visible contradiction of the president’s suggestion that they and their leaders had avoided helping themselves. Cruz has been seen frequently on television reports, including wading through hip-deep water to help people and embracing sobbing constituents as she pleaded for more help.
“I am begging, begging anyone who can hear us to save us from dying,” Cruz said Friday. “We are dying, and you are killing us with the inefficiency.”
Minutes after broadcasts showed Trump telling reporters at the White House on Friday that “we have done an incredible job,” Cruz asserted on camera that the world could see Puerto Ricans being treated “as animals that can be disposed of.”
The controversy created an awkward backdrop for Trump’s plans to visit Puerto Rico on Tuesday, and perhaps the American Virgin Islands, also hit hard by the hurricane.
As has been common in other Trump disputes, Democrats immediately condemned the president while Republican leaders — including House Speaker Paul D. Ryan and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell — remained silent. But some conservatives lamented the president’s reflexive attacks.
“The people of Puerto Rico are hungry, thirsty, homeless and fearful,” conservative writer and radio host Erick Ericksonwrote in an essay. Erickson predicted, accurately, that Trump supporters would contend that Mayor Cruz deserved Trump’s treatment because she criticized the president first.
“Yay, President Trump punched a critic — a critic who is on an island trying her best to help others where most of the people now have no homes, no power, and no running water. What a man he is!” Erickson wrote.
Later in the day, Trump appeared to go out of his way to show some sympathy for the 3.5 million citizens on the island, blaming the news media and Democrats for any suggestion that the recovery effort had been faulty.
“Despite the Fake News Media in conjunction with the Dems, an amazing job is being done in Puerto Rico. Great people!” he tweeted, adding later, “To the people of Puerto Rico: Do not believe the #FakeNews!”
Trump’s comments marked the second straight weekend he has set off a national furor with tweets and comments that targeted nonwhites for criticism. Since last weekend — including on Saturday — he has gone after African American athletes protesting police violence by declining to stand when the national anthem is played. He has demanded that the National Football League fire all such protesters.
His tweets Saturday — the only contact Trump had with the country Saturday as he stayed out of sight at his Bedminster, N.J., golf club — carried similar racial overtones. But instead of casting his opponents as unpatriotic, Trump implied they were lazy. The comments also were in keeping with racial remarks he made in his campaign and presidency — against immigrants, a judge of Mexican descent, the Muslim family of an Army captain killed in Iraq, a Latino beauty queen and others. In June he provoked international criticism when, in the immediate aftermath of a terrorist attack in London, he suggested that Mayor Sadiq Khan, a Muslim, had been politically correct rather than “smart” in countering threats.
As his critics noted, Trump has not been nearly as critical of whites, saying after the violent white supremacist march in Charlottesville, Va., that there were “very nice people” marching amid those carrying Nazi and confederate flags and assault rifles.
The tone of his reaction to Puerto Rico also has differed from his sympathetic response when Texas, Louisiana and Florida recently were struck by Hurricanes Harvey and Irma. Then the president consistently took pains to reassure affected residents, never suggesting anything but praise for their own efforts.
“Texas & Louisiana: We are w/ you today, we are w/ you tomorrow, & we will be w/ you EVERY SINGLE DAY AFTER, to restore, recover, & REBUILD!” he tweeted on Aug. 30.
The president also has suggested that Puerto Rico’s deep fiscal problems will have to be considered when deciding how much to spend rebuilding it, yet he never suggested that money is an object in aiding Texas, whose governor has said it will need up to $180 billion from American taxpayers.
“Big decisions will have to be made as to the cost of its rebuilding!” Trump tweeted about Puerto Rico on Friday.
Since Hurricane Maria struck, the Trump administration has worked mightily to avoid comparisons with the faulty federal response in 2005 to Hurricane Katrina, which devastated New Orleans and surrounding areas — and hobbled George W. Bush for the rest of his presidency. That event, too, featured the contrast between powerful video of suffering Americans and the self-congratulatory words of Bush complimenting his disaster response chief for a job well done. Trump, by his fight with suffering Puerto Ricans, may have hastened the comparison.
Derrick Johnson, interim president of the National Assn. for the Advancement of Colored People, said Trump’s rhetoric showed “a president who does not appreciate the lives of people of color.”
“This is his Katrina moment,” Johnson said. “He is lacking and has been lacking as a moral leader.”
Republican strategist Steve Schmidt said Trump displayed “a profound incapacity for empathy.”
“Millions of Americans are faced with a humanitarian crisis and he’s at his clubhouse using Twitter to attack local leadership on the island? Really? This is going to cause even more suffering,” Schmidt said. “What the American people are seeing is staggering incompetence.”
In some of his more than 20 tweets on Saturday, the president sought to suggest that any criticism of the federal response was a criticism of the first responders — much as he cast NFL players’ protests as directed against service members and veterans, not police violence. He also alleged that reporters who have been in Puerto Rico documenting the hurricane’s aftermath had diminished the role of U.S. rescuers.
“Because of #FakeNews my people are not getting the credit they deserve for doing a great job. As seen here, they are ALL doing a GREAT JOB!” he said in one tweet. It included a nearly 10-minute video of U.S. forces working on behalf of Puerto Ricans, and laudatory comments from Puerto Rico Gov. Ricardo Rossello.
“We’ve been working together; we’ve been getting results,” said Rossello, who is affiliated with Democrats. “The president and the administration have done everything that they can, that we’ve asked them to do.”

These 7 fire-retardant plants may help save your home,https://www.latimes.com/home/la-hm-firescaping-20170930-htmlstory.html,2017-09-30,"Consider all the potential solutions to help save your home during a wildfire and landscaping seems an obvious choice.
But are the drought-tolerant solutions that many of us have already implemented – turfremovalamong them – enough to fend off fire?
According to landscape designer Cassy Aoyagi, president ofFormLA Landscaping, choosing plants that are authentic to our region is one way to help slow advancing fire.
“Many native plants take longer to burn than some of the invasive weeds such as pennisetum and pampas grass,” Aoyagi says.
Non-native invasive plants such as the wild mustard that took over Los Angeles hiking trails last spring help to promote fire. “It’s like kindling,” Aoyagi adds. “What we need are authentic landscapes — landscapes that are natural to this place — that will make us more resilient [to fire, slides, floods] and give us a look that is ours alone.”
To combat invasive plants that may blow in from your neighbor’s yard, Aoyagi recommends using smart irrigation rather than overhead spraying (this leads to germination), heavy mulching and ground covers.
Aoyagi views the recent La Tuna fire, which destroyed five homes and scorched more than 7,000 acres, as an opportunity to talk about how our landscape affects natural disasters.
The key, she says, is to be authentic and to think about what comes after the wildfires.
“If a sumac burns, its roots are still intact,” explains Aoyagi. “When it rains, which we know it will soon, those living roots will retain slopes. In contrast, pennisetum has shallow roots that won’t provide much protection. Natives, like sumac, will also recover faster. Basically, natives protect us through the ups and downs of our climate. They are adapted to 100-year droughts, floods, as opposed to the plants we’ve been using.”
Here, Aoyagi describes seven of her favorite fire-resistant natives that are particularly useful in supporting L.A.’s fire resilience.
There are so many buckwheats, all with a distinctive beauty. The common ground is remarkable, pom-pomlike blooms.
Also an edible, lemonade berry makes a great hedge substitute. You can make a nice, tart tea from its berries.
Oaks are one of California’s truly iconic trees. In addition to aiding fire resilience, their expansive canopies can cool our communities. Placed correctly, they can ower air conditioning costs by about 50%.
Even when its evergreen foliage is burned away, manzanita’s resilient trunks and branches have an architectural beauty that is hard to match. As if that weren’t enough, it is edible.
Woolly blue curls is a highly fragrant, 3- to 4-foot evergreen shrub with violet flowers  in fuzzy spikes. Again, so beautiful.
Wildlife love the berries, and so do we.
Our Lord’s Candle is already beginning to sprout in the area burned in the La Tuna fire. The yucca has an almost iridescent quality when in bloom. Virtually every bit of it is edible at some point during the year. It is a great aesthetic exchange for those who like the look of pampas grass.
Here are some smart examples of putting native, fire-retardant plants to good use:
Authentic Foothill Gardens, Sierra Madre City Hall:Installed two years ago, the foliage in the fire garden adjacent to the fire station will look like it will in a residential garden, as it is on a smart irrigation system. The foliage is varied in color, lush and leafy, and performs year round.SierraMadreGardens.com.
Sunland/Tujunga Welcome Garden:A community project led by Roger Klemm removed highly invasive grasses that had been proactively planted at the intersection of the 210 and Foothill Boulevard. The garden now showcases the best of the more than 300 heat- and drought-resilient species native to the area, including those from coastal sage scrub, chaparral, and oak woodland communities.Sunland Welcome Nature Garden
Sunland/Tujunga Fire Station:This now 100% native garden is the result of an Eagle Scout Project by Travis Whitcomb. It includes a specimen oak that shades the station and more than 70 native plants ideally suited to high-heat and fire-prone areas like Sunland. It now stands in vibrant contrast to the charred hillsides consumed by the La Tuna fire.Los AngelesFire Department- Station 74 - Tujunga / Sunland
Rosemont Preserve:Mostly preserved and unaltered space, however, Arroyos and Foothills Conservancy swapped invasive plants for fire-resistant and slope-retaining natives last year in an effort to protect nearby homes from fire and slides.arroyosfoothills.org/rosemont

Wildfires threaten 100 homes on California’s Central Coast,https://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-ln-lompoc-fires-20170929-story.html,2017-09-30,"Reporting from Lompoc, Calif. —A trio of wildfires raced through the hills of California’s Central Coast on Friday, threatening at least 100 homes as flames tore through tinder-dry brush.
Half a dozen small fires that erupted along a road Friday afternoon merged into three blazes that had burned 300 acres of thick manzanita, chaparral, grass and oak, Santa Barbara County fire spokesman Mike Eliason said.
Winds pushed the flames close to Lompoc neighborhoods, and about 900 people were told to evacuate, he said.
“There’s fire right across the street from homes right now,” he said.
The evacuation area included La Purisima Mission, founded in 1787 and considered to be the most completely restored Spanish mission in California. Firefighters were guarding the historic building, Eliason said.
There was no immediate word on what caused the fires, although the California Highway Patrol indicated it was investigating whether a car dragging a chain might have sparked them.
Meanwhile, a Southern California fire that damaged four homes earlier in the week was 75% contained Friday.
The Canyon Fire that erupted Monday along the border between Corona and Anaheim turned 2,600 acres — about four square miles — of land to ash.
Firefighters managed to protect nearly 2,000 homes as the blaze shifted amid unpredictable winds southeast of Los Angeles.
No injuries were reported.
The cause of the Canyon Fire remains under investigation.

"Losses from Northern California wildfires top $3 billion; 14,000 homes destroyed or damaged",https://www.latimes.com/local/california/la-me-california-wildfire-insurance-claims-20171031-story.html,2017-10-31,"The wildfires that ravaged wine country this month caused at least $3 billion in insured losses, officials said Tuesday.
Insurance Commissioner Dave Jones announced the staggering number and warned it will likely grow as more claims are reported by insurers.
Santa Rosa alone lost 5% of its housing in California’s most destructive wildfire, and some residents have questioned whether they will be able to afford to stay in a region known for its tight housing market and high prices.
More than 40 people died in the fires, and Jones’ office said more than 14,000 homes were damaged or destroyed. Here is a breakdown:
“As shocking as $3 billion in insured losses are, the number is sure to grow, as more claims are coming,” Jones said in a statement.
An army of federal crews in white protective suits descended on Sonoma and Napa counties and beyond seeking to identify and remove the most hazardous waste left behind in the destruction: propane tanks, oil drums, toxic garage chemicals.
The toxic sweep is the first step of the massive post-fire cleanup — the largest ever undertaken in California — that is expected to take place early next year, state and federal officials said.
U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and state officials will survey all the homes, schools and buildings that were reduced to ash before any debris is removed in Napa and Sonoma counties. Then special teams will move in to remove hazardous waste and test each site for toxic substances.
That cleanup must be completed before residents or the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers may clear what remains on each of the burned-out lots.

Mendocino County teen girl dies of burns from Redwood Valley fire,https://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-ln-teen-wildfire-victim-20171030-story.html,2017-10-30,"Kressa Shepherd, the Mendocino County 17-year-old who was severely burned when she and her family fled a wildfire three weeks ago, has died in a Sacramento area hospital.
The teen was found to be brain dead after a CT scan Sunday, said Mindi Ramos, the girl’s aunt. Ramos has been chronicling the condition of Kressa and her parents, Jon and Sara Shepherd, ina blog, which also seeks donations for the family.
Kressa Shepherd is the 43rd victim of the wildfires in Northern California.
Kressa’s 14-year-old brother, Kai, burned to death as the family fled their mountainside home in Redwood Valley northeast of Ukiah as flames came racing through the woods on Oct. 9.
The family was forced to flee on foot after their cars caught fire that morning.
Kai burned to death yards from his home. Sara and Kressa collapsed to the ground and were found severely burned hours later by a neighbor. Jon also collapsed and was found closer to the main road that led to their house.
The trio’s recovery had been agonizing. Both Sara and Kressa were burned over 60% of their bodies. Jon suffered burns over 45% of his body.
Doctors removed both of Kressa’s legs below the knee. She also suffered cardiac arrest two weeks ago.
Ramos wrote that Sara was “very lucid” Thursday and that Jon’s level of lucidity is “just behind” his wife’s.
“She focuses on our faces and continues to nod yes or no and communicate with us,” Ramos wrote.
“It is reported that he was happy to see his visitors, but also that he has been combative,” Ramos wrote. “Anyone that knows Jon, knows this is good news - because that is him for sure! It is so great to see bits of their personalities coming through. Jon is not yet talking and as far as we know has not inquired about the fire or family.”
Throughout the process Ramos has held out hope.
“Kressa Jean is our warrior goddess; the strongest being I’ve ever known. She endured another life-saving surgery today that took both her legs below the knee,” she wrote on Oct. 12. “While this is another tragic turn, we are grateful her life was spared. If anyone can thrive after a tragedy like this, it’s Kressa Jean. Keep praying.”
“This will be long fight, the logistics of which change daily, sometimes hourly. We need your sustained strength, love, and support,” she wrote on Oct. 19.
Thursday she wrote that doctors took Kressa off some blood pressure medications, her paralytic medication and another pain medication to “see what level of responsiveness they can get.”
“Jon, Sara, and Kressa seem to be getting stronger daily,” she wrote then.
On Sunday, it appeared that Kressa was not in pain. When doctors completed a CT scan “it showed that her brain had been dead for some time.”
“There was nothing the doctors could do,” Ramos wrote. “She is no longer in any pain and is with Kai now. Please continue to pray for strength to get through the loss of this precious soul.”
Kressa was a junior at Ukiah High School and a talented artist,her aunt told The Times.

Husband and wife who survived Las Vegas shooting die in car crash,https://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-ln-murrieta-couple-crash-vegas-20171030-story.html,2017-10-30,"A Murrieta couple who grew closer after surviving the mass shooting in Las Vegas on Oct. 1 died weeks later in a car crash not far from their home, relatives and authorities said.
On Oct. 16, just before 11 p.m., Dennis Carver, 52, was driving northbound on Avenida de Arboles in Murietta, with his wife, Lorraine, 54, in the passenger seat. Their 2010 Mercedes went off the roadway on a curve and crashed into two brick pillars and exploded into flames, according to the California Highway Patrol.
The two were pronounced dead at the scene and ultimately identified by the Riverside County coroner.
The couple’s oldest daughter, Brooke Carver, told theLas Vegas Review-Journalthat the pair survived the massacre in Las Vegas earlier this month and seemed deeper in love in the wake of it.
“After the shooting, they heard from all of the people they cared about most. They were so happy,” said Carver, 20. “The last two weeks of their lives were really just spent living in the moment.”
Carver said her parents were among tens of thousands who attended the Route 91 Harvest music festival in Las Vegas this month and were in the crowd when a gunman opened fire from the 32ndfloor of the Mandalay Bay Resort and Casino, killing 58.
Dennis Carver leapt on top of his wife to protect her as bullets flew by. During a pause between the third and fourth bursts of gunfire, the couple got up and ran out and emerged unscathed, their daughter said.
Three days after, Dennis Carver was asking his daughter what kind of flowers she thought her mother would like — roses or something else? The occasion for the flowers, she said, was “just because.”
“He just wanted to give my mom a reason to smile after the shooting,” Brooke Carver said. “I swear they were more in love those two weeks than in the last 20 years.”
About a week after the crash, Dennis Carver’s phone arrived in a package. It had been lost during the chaos of the Las Vegas massacre and an FBI agent had finally gotten around to sending it back.
It was full of loving messages between Carver and his wife and photos of the pair together.
“We’ve found some peace in knowing that our parents just loved each other so much that they had to go at the same time,” the pair’s 16-year-old daughter, Madison, told the Review-Journal. “They couldn’t live without each other.”

San Diego utility customers won’t have to foot costs from 2007 wildfires,https://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-san-diego-wildfires-20171130-story.html,2017-11-30,"TheCalifornia Public Utilities Commissionrejected a request from San Diego Gas & Electric to pass onto ratepayers $379 million in costs related to three deadly wildfires that blazed through the area in 2007.
In making the decision, the commissioners ruled that SDG&E did not reasonably manage and operate its facilities leading up to the Witch, Guejito and Rice fires thatkilled two people, injured 40 firefightersand forced tens of thousands to seek shelter at Qualcomm Stadium. The three fires combined to destroy more than 1,300 homes.
SDG&E officials have maintained the wildfires that enveloped Southern California in October 2007 represented an unprecedented event and insist the utility responsibly managed its service territory.
Even though two commissioners expressed that their votes were “close calls,” all five members voted Thursday morning in San Francisco to reject the utility’s request.
If SDG&E’s request had been approved, it was estimated the average ratepayer would have paid $1.67 more per month over the span of six years.
The decision has been watched closely because it may set a precedent for California utilities, which could face billions of dollars in potential damages in cases of deadly wildfires.

"Weeks after the flames subsided, devastating wine country fires claim their 44th victim",https://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-ln-44th-victim-firestorm-20171130-story.html,2017-11-30,"Michel Azarian, a 41-year-old electrical engineer described as a brilliant problem solver, died Sunday of injuries suffered in October’s wine country fires, according to media reports and Azarian’s close friend.
Azarian, an immigrant from Lebanon of Armenian descent, is the 44th victim to die as a result of thewildfires that ravaged Northern California.
His close friend Khachik Papanyan said Azarian was extremely intelligent, endured Lebanon’s bloody civil war in the 1980s and managed to attend the American University of Beirut, Lebanon’s most prestigious school.
After the Tubbs fire, neighbors found him still alive but trapped in a small clearing outside his home in Santa Rosa, Papanyan said. He was treated at UC Davis Medical Center, but succumbed to severe burns that covered more than half his body.
He loved traveling, photography and hiking the many trails in Silicon Valley, Papanyan said. He also liked being around people and was a member of his local Toastmaster’s International club, which helps members sharpen their public speaking skills.
Azarian’s colleagues at Keysight Technologies and his friends were at his bedside as he fought for survival. Papanyan said one of Azarian’s friends, Vatche Souvalian, flew to Lebanon just to escort Azarian’s elderly mother to the United States.
Papanyan said he still hasn’t come to terms with the loss of his dear friend.
“I don’t think I’ve even quite ascertained what has happened,” Papanyan said. “I think it will take some time to settle that I will never see him again.”

California’s largest ever fire was a force that could not be stopped,https://www.latimes.com/local/california/la-me-epic-fires-california-20171231-story.html,2017-12-31,"Reporting from Ventura —The fire left the mountains ghostly gray, vast slopes frozen still but for dust devils wandering the ash.
Fire crews were conducting a last big operation in the high country, burning a ridge above Hartman Ranch to keep the main fire from mushrooming into a road-less wilderness where condors soar.
The Thomas fire had already torn through disparate points of Southern California — beach enclaves, orange groves, rural canyons, golf retreats and suburban cul-de-sacs. Flames ignited fan palms against the Pacific surf and cedars on high granite peaks.
Residents along the flame front had seen fires come out of the mountains many times before — at horse ranches in Ojai, at farmworker camps in Fillmore, at Tuscan estates in stands of olive trees in Montecito.
But never had they all been threatened by a single fire.
The Thomas fire became California’s largest by size since modern recordkeeping began, standing at over 281,900 acres as of Friday. It raced from the urban edge to deep into the Los Padres National Forest like no fire before it, covering huge distances unobstructed and mostly unseen. The neighborhoods and cities that sit at the foot of these steep ranges — the Santa Ynez, Topatopa, Sierra Madre — had no vantage to the immense wilderness beyond the first ridge or two, no real grasp of what was seething out of sight.
When the fire came over those ridges again and again, to eat homes across a 55-mile swath of civilization, they had to confront that buried seed of doom that Californians forever try to forget: We settled in a dangerously temperamental land.
While we have fought to subdue its mood swings with human ingenuity — canals, levies, dams, injection wells, seismic retrofits, debris basins, brush clearance, tile roofs, hotshot crews, air drops — our efforts are feeble compared to what has and will come.
At the beginning of the year, following a devastating five years of drought, California was having the wettest rainy season ever recorded. The spillways of the mighty Oroville Dam were failing, part of the Central Valley had become an inland sea, and a quarter-mile stretch of Highway 1 was about to fall into the Pacific.
“We broke the drought with a sledgehammer,” said Jeffrey Mount, a hydrologist and senior fellow at the Public Policy Institute of California.
But just enough precipitation came as snow, with the storms spaced out over the season, to avoid a major calamity. “By all objective measures, we should have had catastrophic flooding,” Mount said. “We would be talking billions of dollars of damage and how many people died.”
A long scorching summer followed. In June, Death Valley hit 127 degrees, seven degrees shy of the hottest temperature recorded on earth. The melting snowpack caused flooding in the arid valleys below.
Under a sun that didn’t relent from spring through fall, grass and brush withered.
By October, the wine country erupted in the most destructive firestorm in state history, killing 44 people and claiming over 10,000 homes. Rains stayed far to the north. A high-pressure ridge formed like the one that started the drought in 2011, making this December one of the driest on record.
And so came the Thomas fire, primed to break another record.
When a high-pressure whorl moves east across Nevada and Utah, Santa Ana winds flow from the high desert to the ocean through three main grooves: the Banning Pass from the Coachella Valley, the Cajon Pass from the Victorville area and the Santa Clara River from the Antelope Valley.
In December, that swirling high-pressure dome stalled and wobbled in place. Bill Patzert, climatologist for NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory, likened it to Hurricane Harvey parking over Houston, swamping the city with days of torrential rains.
In Ventura County, the Santa Clara River Valley became a katabatic wind tunnel for two weeks. The spinning blob of pressure, shifting back and forth, changed the direction of the air flow as it fought with the prevailing sea breeze, constantly pushing the fire into new territory.
What was previously California’s largest modern-era blaze, the Cedar fire in San Diego County in 2003, followed a more typical Santa Ana pattern, racing to the coast through canyons running roughly westward.
It was far more deadly and costly than the Thomas because the gentle tilt of San Diego County invited more development into the fire zone. The Cedar’s toll was 15 people and 2,820 structures.
The Thomas fire has claimed 1,063 structures and one firefighter’s life. The terrain it consumed is more rugged, most of it protected or prohibitively steep to build on.
The population center hit the hardest, Ventura, was on the low edge of the foothills — vulnerable, but easy to evacuate. Homes that burned were less than a mile from the relative safety of the flat Santa Clara River Valley and the coast. No one died there.
Among the streets worst hit: Via Ondulando, a typical postwar street of ranch and Spanish homes, diamond grid windows, lush front lawns, birds of paradise, baby blue plumbago, Italian cypress.
Raul Gamino, a retired car salesman, had lived on the street for 42 years and used to hike in the hills above his home with his grandchildren. But he never gave much thought to how those dry-grass hills connected to the mountains beyond, how fire from far away could whip across it in his sleep. He never imagined a fire that would cover 440 square miles, as the Thomas would. His thoughts generally followed the view, the green coastal plain to Point Mugu and the Pacific.
Over the years, Gamino, 75, had watched countless hours of news reports on flames in Montecito or Santa Barbara. Those disasters seemed distant to him, way up the coast, the way a Lawndale or Culver City resident might watch a blaze in Malibu. He could smell the smoke, ponder the ash and the strange orange light. But they lived in fire country; he did not, he thought.
On Dec. 4, when a friend told him fire was burning up the valley in Santa Paula, he said, “Ah, it never gets here. It never happened before. I’ve been in Ventura for 53 years.”
That night, embers machine-gunned southwest down a boot heel of eroded ravines known as Sulphur Mountain.
As the sky lit up orange, he and his wife Yolanda fled with just a pillow and blankets. They slept in their SUV in a Walmart parking lot.
The fire followed the hills to the heart of downtown Ventura, burning right up to the back of City Hall, before that finger was stopped by flatter terrain and firefighting.
The Gaminos drove back up their hill three days later. In spots, the gutters had become adorned by the braided sculptures of melted alloy rims, wildfire’s ubiquitous signature on the urban edge.
Of 63 homes on the street, 32 burned to the ground. The Gaminos’ yellow stucco-and-tile house survived, as if nothing had happened at all. The lawn was still green. Their king palms luffed in the breeze. Yolanda cried out of relief and sadness and pure shock. He was calm, a perpetual optimist.
Their neighbor across the street, Debbie, a retired teacher who was giving Yolanda English lessons, lost her home. Only the book exchange box on the curb survived.
She and Raul had moved in the same year. They had both lost spouses to cancer. The death of Gamino’s first wife taught him that property didn’t mean much.
“The only thing that is important is your life. We worry too much about property,” he said.
But the scope of personal loss on a street like this is as hard to fathom as is the scale of the fire itself.
On Via Ondulando, you can see hints of it.
Debbie’s book box.
The old meticulously kept Rambler with whitewall tires, scorched in a driveway.
The silence of a ruined home but for the handmade tin windmills still clanging and spinning in the wind. The melted children’s swings.
The bowls of dog and cat food left in the driveway out of desperation.
By the time the Gaminos returned, the wind had turned northwest and pushed the fire deep into the mountains, at times shifting to the north and northeast. The air parched throats and cracked lips and chapped the chaparral that already hadn’t had water for nearly 10 months.
“The constant was the dryness,” said Patzert, the climatologist.
The most worrisome finger of the conflagration crawled west along the Santa Ynez into the territory of another fearsome downslope wind, the local sundowner, which hits just after sunset as interior temperatures in the valleys drop fast. For over a week, crews bulldozed and hand-cut lines along the ridge to keep the sundowners from driving the fire straight into Montecito, to limited success.
Now the fire’s prolonged tour came to some of the wealthiest real estate in the world, dragging castle owners into the collective experience of modest suburbanites, avocado growers, beach shack dwellers, crop pickers and back-to-the-landers.
On Dec. 20, strong sundowners were predicted, this time threatening Santa Barbara.
On Via Ondulando in Ventura, the fire had passed and the Gaminos went about their routine — drove to the local L.A. Fitness for a Zumba class, raked the avocado leaves in the side yard. But their street was a ruin.
On East Camino Cielo, 3,600 feet above Santa Barbara, fire crews shored up lines on the ridge. The fire was skunking now, as they say, smoldering in the fallen leaf duff. It needed a hard wind to bring it back up to flame.
But as the sun sank over San Miguel Island, the wind rustled up only a few heavy gusts — the last gasps of the Thomas, as far as the threat to humans and property went.
Deep in the Los Padres National Forest, the fight was to protect the wilderness now. Firefighters had driven an hour up Highway 33 from Ojai, through a landscape so charred that only the raw rock along road cuts showed color, an almost incandescent yellow against the gray.
At the Hartman Ranch, they were trying to create a space void of fuel to keep the fire from running north into thick vegetation, then spreading east into the Sespe Wilderness or west into the footprint of the Zaca fire, which burned 240,000 acres in 2007. No one was quite sure if the chaparral there had grown back enough to burn again. And if it burned twice in such short succession, would it ever recover?
Such were the questions of the new fire era.
All the top five wildfires in California by size have occurred since 2003. It is a cliche by now for commanders at every big fire to say they have never seen “anything like this.”
But Kevin Chargois, an engine captain from San Bernardino National Forest overseeing the back-burn, had to deal with conditions he says he honestly never encountered during regular fire seasons. For one, at 4,500 feet in December, his hoses and valves kept freezing at night. The crews had to wait for them to thaw in the morning to use.
“Here we are, a few days before Christmas, 16 days of fire, and 15 have been red-flag warnings for Santa Anas,” he said.
As he spoke the air was getting moist, and the backfire was not taking off like they wanted it to.
They brought out a flame-throwing terra torch to blaze it up. But the weather kept getting colder and more humid — bad for their backfire effort, but good to dampen the main fire.
Their prescribed burn was petering out. An onshore wind picked up.
Suddenly, they were quickly packing up the trucks to get out while they could.
It was snowing.

"Editorial: A balancing of power between genders, an end to Trump’s Twitter feed and other wishes for 2018",https://www.latimes.com/opinion/editorials/la-ed-new-years-wishes-trump-syria-congress-20171230-story.html,2017-12-30,"Well, 2017 was quite a ride, wasn’t it?Record wildfiresin the West; aTrumpster firein the Oval Office;massive dissonanceand attacks onthe truthnearly everywhere; and, despite thecollapseof Islamic State, continuedwar in Syriahelping propel aglobal migration crisis— 65.6 million displaced people — on a scale that surpasses even that of World War II. Enormous political and cultural divisions continued to roil the United States, Congress rolled over on the president’s Cabinet appointees and the gutting of essential institutions continued. It should go without saying that, for the most part, our 2016 wishes went unfulfilled.
But hey, the Dodgers camethiscloseto winning the World Series, so we’ve got that going for us.
Hope springs eternal, as Alexander Pope wrote nearly 300 years ago. So, with optimism propelling us through the sea of cynicism, here’s is The Times’ annual list of wishes, in no particular order. Remember, these are wishes, not predictions.
— a greater effort tokeep politics out of the investigationsinto Trump, the Russians, the firing of FBI Director James B. Comey and whether the president’s actions since the election have constituted an attempt to obstruct justice.
— a continuedfocus onmen’s bad behavior toward women — from banal chauvinism to sexual assault. We’re hoping for not just a momentary ripple of revelations, but an actual correction in the imbalance of power and respect between the genders.
— a retreat of alt-rightism and white nationalism (good-bye, Stephen K. Bannon; so long, Breitbart).
— an end to the devastating war in Syria and a ratcheting back of tensions between the Sunni and Shiite regimes across the Middle East.
— a stop to thebrutal persecutionof Rohingya Muslims by the Myanmar government and a recognition of their right to live in peace.
— a path to peace for unsettled regions of Africa — from Libya to the Central African Republic to Somalia — and a way home for those displaced by conflict.
— the discontinuance of Trump’s Twitter account and cable TV feed. Surely someone in the White House can figure out how to do that.
— a reversal onBrexit. The people of Britain should come to their collective senses and find a way out of this mess.
— a negotiated solution to demands forCatalan independence.
— less whataboutism. Americans should think twice before responding to fair criticism of their movement or party or favorite politician with, “Yeah, but what about ...?”
— a national conversation about the need to retire the phrase “national conversation.”
— an important Supreme Court decision decided not only unanimously but without any concurring opinions. Come on, justices, you can do it.
— an end to the rash of new (and often unconstitutional) proposals in statehouses across the country that woulderodea woman’s constitutional right to abortion.
— a more enlightened, pragmatic approach to marijuana, which is currently classified as just as dangerous as heroin — even though it is now legal in some form in more than 40 states. Congress has made it too difficult to conduct necessary research into marijuana’s effects on users, challenging states’ abilities to craft rational regulations.
— a lot more housing in Southern California for the working poor and for middle-class families who need stable, affordable places to live.
— rejection of the Republicans’ cynical, self-serving ballot initiative to repeal the state Legislature’s 12-cent-per-gallon gas tax hike, which was passed to pay for road repairs and other critical transportation infrastructure.
— continued focus on the city of Los Angeles by Mayor Eric Garcetti, who should not let his presidential ambitions get in the way of his day job. L.A. still faces a budget deficit, a housing shortage, a homeless crisis and many other challenges that demand his full attention.
— a reduction in partisanship posing as news, and increased resources for clear-eyed and independent journalism.
— Democrats to heal the progressive-moderate schism that is threatening their chances to win seats in Congress in November. And while they’re at it, to stop with the rear-view mirror stuff about the 2016 presidential primaries.
— Republicans to realize that Trump is not one of their own and that he does not have the nation’s best interests at heart. And that he is not the straight-talking middle-class champion he pretended to be.
— a free and open internet without interference by broadband providers, and better solutions by Facebook and other social media giants to the flood of fake news and propaganda across their platforms.
— an end to Washington gamesmanship over the federal debt ceiling and government funding.
— Republicans to join Democrats in trying to make health insurance more accessible and affordable, rather than pursuing their endless attack on Obamacare.
— more Angelenos to take mass transit.
— direct, productive talks between the United States and North Korea.
— a recognition by Americans that protecting the environment and combating climate change will take more than slapping a bumper sticker on the SUV.
— California to keep the single-use plastic-bag momentum going — and to ban polystyrene take-out containers.
— another rain-filled California winter (despite the dry start) to stave off a return to drought conditions. (While we’re at it, we also wish for no major earthquakes or additional mega-wildfires.)

Scientists search for survivors after the Thomas fire scorches a condor sanctuary,https://www.latimes.com/local/california/la-me-thomas-fire-condors-20171230-story.html,2017-12-30,"Reporting from FILLMORE, Calif. —Pushed by instinct and age, a fledgling California condor had been expected to step to the edge of its cliff-side cave sometime in December and, with black-and-white wings flapping hard, make its first flight over the scrubby terrain of the Los Padres Sespe Condor Sanctuary.
But then the Thomas fire broke out.
The blaze ripped across Los Padres National Forest and into the 53,000-acre sanctuary, where 80 of the state’s 172 free-flying condors spend much of their time.
On Dec. 15, the 11th day of the fire, scientists lost contact with a radio transmitter attached to the turkey-size chick known as No. 871 as flames raced toward its closet-size cave. Days later a biologist chaperoned by a strike team from the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection picked up a faint ping with an uneven tempo coming from the vicinity of the condor’s nest, but the findings were inconclusive.
At sunrise Wednesday, a team of biologists armed with telemetry equipment fanned out across charred wilderness that had been closed for weeks northeast of the community of Fillmore on a mission to pick up signals that could, perhaps, lead them to the 4-month-old condor, or its carcass.
With a 9 1/2-foot-wingspan, the federally endangered California condor is the largest scavenging bird in the nation and a symbol of both a species on the brink of extinction and successful, yet still precarious, efforts to restore imperiled populations.
The biologists tried to remain optimistic. The young bird and its parents — No. 513 and No. 206 — were descendants of a species that has survived since the Pleistocene Age of a million years ago.
But as the Thomas fire grew to become the biggest in California history, there was reason for concern.
Before barging through dense, thorny brush with a telemetry antenna held high, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service biologist Joseph Brandt took stock of a worrisome scene on the far side of a scorched canyon overlooking Sespe Creek. Peering through binoculars, he saw splotches of red fire retardant on nearby ridgelines and a few smoldering hot spots. “The fire burned right up to the entrance of the condor cave,” he said.
It would not be the first time geographically isolated condors were wiped out in severely burned areas. Wildfires have taken the lives of seven condors that were part of the federal recovery effort since 1992, Brandt said. “Nearly all of them burned up when fire roared through their roosting areas at night.”
As he spoke, Nadya Sealfaith, a condor technician at theSanta Barbara Zoo, detected good news with a hand-held antenna.
“I’ve got a strong signal — and it’s from 871,” she said. “It’s coming from the canyon bottom north of the cave. So, she’s alive and moving.”
The question was whether she would stay that way.
Fledgling condors typically don’t get very far — and often crash land — on their first flight, Brandt said, leaving them vulnerable to predators. They also rely on their parents for a year or longer to find and bring back food.
And though adult condors are protective, they might abandon a chick if smoke and ash from a fire become too intense, scientists say.
The mission quickly took on two goals: Find the chick and, if possible, find her parents.
The team of trackers split into two groups, each tramping down no-nonsense trails in the wilderness set aside for endangered species including condors, arroyo toads, red-legged frogs and steelhead trout.
Condors have been in jeopardy since the 1950s, when development began to encroach on the species’ habitat, and the now-banned pesticide DDT made condor eggshells so thin they often could not support life.
Some of the huge birds were shot or died of lead poisoning when they fed upon the carcasses of other animals killed with lead shot and bullets.
Scientists began recovery efforts by capturing the few remaining wild condors, breeding them in captivity and releasing the birds in their historical range. Today, the population worldwide is 485.
Some of them soar over Ventura County, the Grand Canyon, the Sierra Nevada foothills and Baja California. For the first time in nearly four decades, condors are roosting about 40 miles west of Yosemite National Park.
Others are incaptive breeding programs. Condors born and bred in captivity and released into the wild must frequently be trapped, then tested and treated for lead poisoning.
If the population continues to grow at current rates, the vulture that scientists know asGymnogyps californianusmay be eligible for down-listing from endangered to threatened within a few decades, researchers say.
At 12:30 p.m. on Wednesday, the biologists’ hand-held radios crackled with evidence that was testament to what hard work, passion and the resiliency of nature can accomplish. It was the beacon of the mother and father, picked up by Sealfaith as she stood by a cliff edge.
In the distance, she saw the birds.
“They’re circling over the nest in search of their chick,” she said over the radio.
“Great news,” Brandt said. “In about five years, 871 will be teaching her own offspring to soar.”

‘We’re going to die in here!’ New York fire victim said in a last phone call to her daughter,https://www.latimes.com/nation/la-na-bronx-fire-20171229-story.html,2017-12-30,"Reporting from New York —As flames closed in, trapping Maria Batiz and her 8-month-old granddaughter in a burning apartment building, her daughter could hear the growing panic in her mother’s voice.
“We’re going to die in here!” Batiz, 58, screamed during a final phone call to her daughter, the baby’s mother.
Batiz and the baby were found dead in a bathtub where they had sought refuge as a fast-moving fire tore through their building Thursday night in the New York borough of the Bronx. “She was frantic,” said Fernando Batiz, the dead woman’s brother. “I guess the smoke overcame her.”
The fire, which killed 12 people, was started by a child playing with a stove, Fire Commissioner Daniel Nigro said Friday.
New York Mayor Bill de Blasio called the blaze, the city’s deadliest in more than 25 years, “an unspeakable tragedy.”
“In the middle of the holiday season, a time when families are together, tonight here in the Bronx there are families that have been torn apart,” he said.
The fire occurred in a five-story brick building in the Belmont neighborhood, a residential area known as Little Italy of the Bronx. The building was home to a mix of residents, including Latinos and West Africans.
Not counting the Sept. 11 attacks, It was New York’s deadliest fire since a blaze at the Happy Land Social Club, less than a mile away, killed 87 people in 1990.
Nigro said fire investigators worked through the night and determined that the blaze originated in a first-floor apartment, where a 3-year-old boy had been playing with the burners on a stove in the kitchen.
The boy’s mother was alerted to the fire by the boy’s screams, Nigro said. She grabbed him and another child, a 2-year-old, and fled the apartment, leaving the door open.
“Fire travels up,” Nigro said. “The stairway acted like a chimney. It took the fire so quickly up the stairs that people had very little time to react.”
Flames blocked some people from exiting down the stairwell of the walk-up building, while others were overcome by smoke.
Twelve people died and four others were critically injured. The victims were spread out over multiple floors, authorities said.
Some of the victims were identified by police. In addition to Batiz and her granddaughter, they include four members of the same family: Karen Stewart-Francis, 37; her daughters Kylie Francis, 2, and Charmela Francis, 7; and her niece Shantay Young, 19.
Stewart-Francis’ sister-in-law, Rosette Morgan-Stewart of Queens, said her husband identified the bodies. The Stewart family is a large, loving family from Jamaica, she said, and they were all reeling over the deaths.
“Somewhere in my head, I want to think it’s a dream, and I’m going to see them walk through the door saying, ‘We’re OK,’ ” Morgan-Stewart told The Times.
She remembered her sister-in-law as a lively woman who loved to dance. For much of her adult life, she took care of her nieces and nephews, not interested in having her own children. But then she fell in love, got married and had children.
“I really still can’t believe that they’re dead,” she said.
Neighbors described seeing thick smoke emanating from the building’s windows and people climbing down fire escapes, some wearing only T-shirts and shorts in the bone-chilling cold, with temperatures in the teens.
As many as 20 people were out on fire escapes when firefighters arrived, about three minutes after the first call came in just before 7 p.m., Nigro said. Firefighters were able to rescue at least 12 people.
Marisol Santana, 35, who lives across the street from the apartment building, said she came outside late Thursday after smelling gas and saw firefighters pull out a child, whom she estimated to be under 5, who was still on fire.
“They tried to put it out, but they couldn’t,” she said. “It’s tragic what happened to those families.”
Esther Sakyi, 49, was making a phone call in her fourth-floor bedroom about 7 p.m. when she smelled smoke.
“I rushed to open the door and the smoke just hit me and pushed me back, so I closed it and went to the fire escape,” she said. She fled into the frigid night before putting on clothes.
“I was naked,” she said. “I didn’t have time to put clothes on. I didn’t know what was going to happen.”
Milka Garcia, who lives on the fifth floor of the building, said her three children had already been evacuated when she came home.
Garcia, 40, said the children saw lots of smoke and had to get out through an emergency door.
She said her 10-year-old daughter went to school with one of the victims, who’s about 8 years old.
“This is horrible,” Garcia said. “It makes me sad because they were my neighbors, and friends of my daughter.”
New York City records show that the apartment building had open violations for faulty smoke and carbon monoxide detectors in a first-floor apartment. Nigro said he didn’t know whether alarms in the first-floor apartment where the fire started were working at the time of the incident.
He said there was nothing structurally unusual about the building that would have contributed to the fire’s spread. But he added that the fire showed how dangerous it could be to leave children unattended and urged people to follow fire safety precautions.
“You’ve seen the ads — close the door, close the door, close the door,” he said. “The results if you don’t are what happened here last night.”

"Artist John Wullbrandt lost vital paintings in the Thomas fire, but found renewal in fighting the flames",https://www.latimes.com/entertainment/arts/la-et-cm-john-wullbrandt-carpinteria-20171229-story.html,2017-12-29,"Fighting off the flames of the Thomas fire was an “unbelievable experience,” said Carpinteria artist John Wullbrandt, who along with his partner fought the flames to protect their 100-acre property.
The Thomas fire swept through Ventura and Santa Barbara counties, charring areas like this one in Upper Rincon Canyon. It is the state’s largest fire on record.
Fire-resistant cactuses and succulents helped beat back some of the flames that reached the 100-acre El Rancho Botello, the ranch just above Carpinteria that artist John Wullbrandt owns with partner Jean-Claude Rivalland.
John Wullbrandt sifts through the ashes of his painting archives. Although he and Rivalland saved the main ranch house, they lost the barn where Wullbrandt’s larger paintings were stored and two shipping containers filled with his life’s work.
Once the fire got close, Jean-Claude Rivalland, left, and John Wullbrandt had to hose down their outdoor animals, including two donkeys -- El Paso, foreground, and Paris. The animals survived.
“We were told to evacuate,” the painter John Wullbrandt says of being warned that the Thomas fire was heading for his Carpinteria ranch. “But Jean-Claude and I chose to stay with the animals and ride it out.”
Once the Thomas fire had scorched the needles off the ranch’s cactuses, the cows were able to easily enjoy the tasty treats. The idea to plant fire-resistant succulents at El Rancho Botello proved a fortunate one.
Jean-Claude Rivalland wears a mask as a precaution against the smoke and ash still swirling in the Carpinteria area. Recalling the night he and his partner sprayed down their house and animals as the Thomas fire approached, Rivalland said, “At times, I didn’t think we would survive.”
Rivalland surveys scorched hills on his way to check on El Rancho Botello’s water tanks.
Rivalland hugs one of El Rancho Botello’s three 5,000-gallon water tanks. But for the water from these tanks, he and partner John Wullbrandt would not have saved their ranch, their animals and themselves.
With Wullbrandt and Rivalland’s ranch house in the distance, charred brush stands as ghostly sculpture left behind by the fire.
A 2007 photo shows the barn where Wullbrandt’s larger paintings were kept. These paintings found homes before the Thomas fire hit, but the structure was reduced to a pile of charred metal roofing and ash.
Carpinteria painter Wullbrandt, photographed after the Thomas fire, says that with loss will come new life for the landscape. “It really will be like the Phoenix rising out of the ashes, the rebirth,” he says. “It will be so much more beautiful once it starts to rejuvenate. We’re gonna see wildflowers we haven’t seen in 100 years.”
It was close to midnight when the call came from a panicked neighbor. A roaring wildfire was racing down the mountain and the flames would be there soon. It was time to get out.
But John Wullbrandt, a prolific artist who’d been painting the landscape around La Granada Mountain since he was a teenager, refused to leave. He’d been preparing for this moment for the last 15 years.
The 100-acre former cattle ranch just above Carpinteria in Santa Barbara County has been in Wullbrandt’s family for four generations. Fire was always a threat.
He and his partner, Jean-Claude Rivalland, had encased the house in corrugated steel, installed three 5,000-gallon water tanks and laid 300 feet of fire hose. Each year, they cleared vegetation around the house and had circled the structure with fire-resistant succulents. Decades of his paintings, including the works he cherished most, were tucked away in two steel shipping containers he believed could withstand a wildfire. They were going to stay, and fight.

Shortly after midnight on Dec. 10, as the Thomas fire raced toward them, Wullbrandt took the northeast corner of the house, Rivalland the southwest. They tied their animals — two donkeys, two cows, a mule and a horse — to the side of the house and hosed them down with water. They figured their four dogs and two cats would be safe inside the house, and the tortoise could ride out the fire in the bathtub.
Finally, the towering wall of flames reached them. They affixed their mask respirators and battled the onslaught with fire hoses, buckets of water and the animals’ drinking troughs. The fire’s deafening moan was so loud it sounded like a freight train, and the smoke so thick, they couldn’t communicate or see one another. So they fought solo, each feeling he was the last man on Earth, ensconced in scalding heat, flying embers and whirling ash.
When it was over, Wullbrandt had learned what near-death looks like: it is crimson and deep orange, as if rendered in the “Naphthol Red” and “Cadmium Orange” tubes of paint that he often works with. It is brilliant and murky at once, with flickers of gold, deep-green and blue, like the rolling hills, ripe fruit and sun-dappled beach in Wullbrandt’s downtown Carpinteria murals. In the eye of the fire, not unlike when he’s painting sometimes, Wullbrandt says he felt an otherworldly calm.
“It was like being in the epicenter of a blowtorch,” Wullbrandt says. “It took all of our might. But we were well prepared, we were confident, like when I paint — I had peace of mind. It was actually quite beautiful, haunting.”
With his tanned face, bushy, Santa Claus-like beard and soft, hazel eyes, 66-year-old Wullbrandt looks like a modern-day cowboy, rugged and sensitive. He grew up in Carpinteria, where his late father, Ernest C. Wullbrandt, served multiple terms as mayor. The sleepy beach town was spared from the fire, the largest in California history, but is still dangerously smoky more than a week after the first flames. As Wullbrandt strolls down the ash-speckled sidewalks of Wullbrandt Way — named after his father — he stirs a “big man on campus” reaction. Neighbors, friends, local business owners — some wearing dust masks as they run errands — nod as they pass by, often slapping him on the shoulder or stopping for hugs.
Driving up the mountain to Wullbrandt’s ranch in his old Mitsubishi SUV, the scene along the rocky, dirt road looks like a steam punk moonscape of blackened tree skeletons coated in gray ash. Crisped shipping containers and lone propane tanks litter empty lots where houses once stood, their barbed wire fences now bent and charred. Spindly curls of smoke swirl up from the canyon below, where tree trunk stumps still smolder, their roots still sparking with fire. The air is so thick with smoke, it leaves a bitter, burnt taste with every breath. When the wind picks up, it sends enormous, billowy clouds of gray ash into the car’s path, obscuring the bumpy road ahead.
Wullbrandt left the area in 1978 for San Francisco, he explains in the car, to forge a career as an artist. He was rejected by the commercial gallery establishment there — “devastating” at the time, he says — but he made a living over more than three decades through private commissions and selling artwork to luxury hotels and resorts around the U.S. mainland and Hawaii. His pastoral scenes of local flora and fauna and illustrated cultural histories have adorned hotel suites, lobbies and golf clubhouses.
With San Francisco as his home base, Wullbrandt traveled the world for weeks at a time looking for inspiration — India, Nepal, Japan, South Africa — and making paintings. He spent time in 1994 as artist-in-residence for King George of Tonga, he says, creating interior murals for a new villa.
His many public artworks have included a site-specific mural about the history of the Van Nuys Airport, a city-commissioned architecturaltrompe l’oeilon a building in San Francisco’s Tenderloin district and multiple murals inside the Dole Food Co.’s corporate headquarters in Westlake Village.
When San Francisco became too expensive for the artist and his longtime partner, they returned to Carpinteria and in 2002 bought “El Rancho Botello,” which his great-great uncle homesteaded in 1913. It was a working cattle ranch until last year. Wullbrandt, a longtime vegetarian, suddenly had to learn how to brand and castrate cows, buck hay and herd cattle.
All the while, Wullbrandt painted, working intensely for weeks at a time in his studio formed from a stand-alone cabin encased in meta and two adjacent shipping containers situated about 600 feet from the house. Capturing the local landscape and its history is his passion. Nearly all of his neighbors own pieces of his art, he says. In 2013, the late “Fast & Furious” actor Paul Walker commissioned two pieces.
One of his works is in the collection of the Carpinteria Valley Museum of History; others are on loan to local businesses. His most recent mural, chronicling agricultural development in Carpinteria, was unveiled in the town’s center earlier this year.
Knowing that his personal collection of paintings was safe in his studio — decades of carefully rendered observations — brought him a deep sense of purpose and accomplishment.
“So many of my murals have been destroyed over the years,” he says, “I felt it was responsible to hold onto some [art] — that I was in charge of holding onto my own history.”
The inferno, which cut through Wullbrandt’s property like “fast-flowing lava,” torched 100-year-old oaks, ceanothus trees and swaths of coyote bush. It left the outer regions of the ranch burned to a crisp, the now-ashy landscape dotted with sizzled trees, charred antique farm equipment, shattered glass and fried rat and rabbit carcasses.
Wullbrandt admits that some might consider it irresponsible to stay at the ranch and fight the fire, especially considering the sheriff’s call, two days earlier, urging them to evacuate.
“But I’m passionate about where I live and I have the freedom to make that choice,” he says. “The ranch hadn’t burned in over 100 years, so we knew it was coming, it was inevitable. We prepared. We spent 15 yearsbeingresponsible.”
And the plan worked, at least in part. The house and its immediate surroundings were untouched, save for a 1-inch burn spot on the front porch step and tiny fire lashings on the porch posts. The animals were also spared.
But all his preparations for protecting the art studio were for naught. It was burned into oblivion.
Wullbrandt knew the studio and shipping containers had wood floors, but he was certain there was metal beneath them. That was not the case. The fire blew underneath and ignited everything inside, turning decades worth of paintings into ash. The oldest work that Wullbrandt lost was a series of charcoal figurative drawings from when he was in junior high school; his most treasured work lost was a still life painting of an Art Deco vase in which he felt he’d successfully experimented with the rules of composition.
Most devastating, Wullbrandt says, is his ravaged archives: 50 years worth of letters, personal photographs and slides, portfolios of drawings and sketches, treasured books, maquettes for murals, pre-internet newspaper and magazine articles about him, along with TV and radio interviews on VHS and cassette tapes and documentation from early public art projects — all turned to dust.
The corrugated steel barn, too, was destroyed; it also didn’t have a metal floor, as Wullbrandt had thought. He lost three significant large-scale paintings that were housed there, along with family heirloom furniture, century-old tools his family used to build the ranch and his sister’s collection of antique saddles.
“It was terrible,” he says of watching his art studio burn during the fire. “But I thought: ‘We’re alive.’”
This is what rejuvenation looks like: It is “Chromium Oxide Green” and “Light Blue Violet,” like the tubes of paint Wullbrandt will use in the landscape paintings he’s planning for an upcoming show. Just a week before the fire, he was voted into the Oak Group, an artists organization that raises money for environmental preservation causes. They’ll exhibit his work at the Santa Barbara Public Library’s Faulkner Gallery, as part of a group show, in the fall. He’ll also have a solo show in 2018 at Carpinteria’s Palm Loft Gallery, he says.
“The fire has given me an opportunity to show my work, it’s given me something to head towards,” Wullbrandt says.
Losing so much in the fire, he says, has been oddly liberating. For years, Wullbrandt meant to organize his archives. But that would have required classifying his history, and he isn’t one who likes to be pigeonholed, he says. He never clung to an artistic identity as a “muralist” or “landscape painter,” for example; instead, he’s toggled between genres, experimenting with figure drawing, magical realism, abstraction, landscapes and set design, among other styles. Losing everything frees him from the daunting task of sorting his sprawling life’s work and, for better or worse, from his personal narrative. It presented an opportunity to start anew.
“There’s not being burdened with all the trappings of my life,” he says. “I thought that one day I would take all of this archival stuff and turn it over to someone; and somehow that would validate my career. But I don’t have to do that now. I’m free to paint.”
Wullbrandt may be eerily at peace about the Thomas fire, but standing by the remains of his destroyed barn — now just layers of charred steel — he chokes up thinking about his ancestors.
“The fact that my family’s ranch burned on my watch,” he says, tears pooling in his now bloodshot eyes. “It’s been tough. But I know I did everything I could. My ancestors would be darn proud.”
The sorrow is compounded at the mention of his neighbors. “My heart goes out to those who have lost far more than I have,” he says.
Still, Wullbrandt remains optimistic. In town, Wullbrandt stops at a small garage that was once his grandfather’s plumbing shop and which he now uses for storage. He lifts the metal grate and there, piled up with the cardboard boxes, bikes and old furniture, was a glossy, 10-foot-wide painting of his ranch in better times, vibrant and alive. It depicts cowboys roping and herding cattle across dark green hills, the Carpinteria Valley and city of Santa Barbara stretching out to the sea in the background.
“Gone, all of this gone,” he says, sweeping his hand across the landscape depicted in the painting.
But with loss comes new life.
“It really will be like the Phoenix rising out of the ashes, the rebirth,” he says. “It will be so much more beautiful once it starts to rejuvenate. We’re gonna see wildflowers we haven’t seen in 100 years.”
Then Wullbrandt gazes up at a mountain ridge in the distance, now a thin, ash-gray paint stroke on the horizon.
“The spring — just wait. As an artist, I can’t wait to paint it.”

Nearly $12 billion in insurance claims have been filed due to California wildfires,https://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-ln-fire-insurance-claims-california-20180131-story.html,2018-01-31,"Insurers in California have received more than $11.7 billion in claims from wildfires that ripped across Northern and Southern California last year, the state insurance commissioner announced Wednesday.
“If you treat these October and December fires as a combined incident, these insured losses represent one of the most damaging natural catastrophes in California history,” said state Insurance Commissioner Dave Jones.
The series of fires that killed dozens of residents in California’s wine country in Napa, Sonoma and Mendocino counties in October and destroyed thousands of homes generated nearly $10 billion in claims alone, Jones said.
Two months later, when dry desert winds parched the Southern California landscape and drove fires in San Diego, Riverside, Los Angeles, Ventura and Santa Barbara counties, hundreds of homes were lost. The biggest of the fires, the Thomas fire, spread across more than 280,000 acres and became the largest on record in California.
The Southland fires generated more than $1.7 billion in insurance claims, Jones said.
Together the fires generated about $11.77 billion in claims.
“We no longer have a fire season in California, fires are year-round,” Jones said. “The fires were unprecedented for their severity and disastrous consequences. Whole neighborhoods were wiped out.”
The fires on both ends of the state spanned 14 counties altogether, he said. In response, Jones issued a formal notice asking insurance companies to waive requirements for policyholders that they provide a detailed inventory of their losses to pay up to 100% of the claim.
Nearly all insurance providers have agreed to Jones’ request, he said.
In Southern California, the fires in December were followed by a historic storm cell in January that triggered a deadly mudslide in Montecito on Jan. 9. It is too early to tally the claims from that disaster, Jones said.
But, he said, since it appears that the mudslide’s “proximate cause” was the Thomas fire – which most homeowners were covered for – companies should pay out claims for mudslide damage even if they didn’t have flood insurance. He issued a formal notice telling companies as much on Monday.
“California law provides that when a covered peril is in effect the proximate cause of an uncovered peril, then insurers should pay claims with the uncovered peril,” he said. “If the fire is covered by the policy and is the proximate cause of the mudslide which is not, insurers should pay claims.”
It was not immediately clear when an official connection between the Thomas fire and the Montecito mudslide would be determined, but Jones said that insurers should “take appropriate steps to assess the claims” in the meantime.

"Newsletter: Today: On Healthcare, Democrats Are Playing the Long Game",https://www.latimes.com/newsletters/la-me-todays-headlines-20180228-story.html,2018-02-28,"To deal with the shortcomings of Obamacare, Democrats see the expansion of existing public programs as a more pragmatic and politically viable way forward.
TOP STORIES
On Healthcare, Democrats Are Playing the Long Game
Democrats have spent a lot of time defending Obamacare from Republicans trying to repeal and replace it. Now, they’re looking to overhaul thehealthcare systemin a different way:by expanding government programs like Medicare and Medicaid. One leading liberal think tank even released a plan for something called“Medicare Extra” for all Americans, while still giving workers the option to stick with coverage offered through an employer. Though the various Democratic proposals would be less sweeping than the “single-payer” system Sen. Bernie Sanders has advocated, they will face opposition from those in the medical industry worried about having to accept lower prices. And of course, withPresident Trumpand congressional Republicans running the show, don’t expect to see any of them become law anytime soon. But Democrats hope that by playing the long game, they can avoid the healthcare morass the GOP fell into last year.
Kushner’s Clearance Clash
The Middle East. China. Mexico. On all of these issues and more, Trump has gone to son-in-law and senior advisorJared Kushner. Now there are questions about whether Kushner’s work will be inhibited, after his security clearance was downgraded along with that of dozens of other White House aides whose background checks had yet to be completed, according to a source.The change means Kushner no longer has access to the president’s daily briefing, which includes the most sensitive intelligence information. Still, Trump has the last word on who can be in the room with him when officials share it.

Society’s Betrayal of the Mentally Ill
By the latest count, the mentally ill make up about one-third of the homeless in Los Angeles. Supportive housing can make a big difference for them, by offering a place to live, get medication and receive counseling. But too often, they stay on the streets or wind up in jail. The latest in a series ofTimes editorialson homelessness argues thatmaking jails the centerpiece of mental health treatmentis a monumental betrayal of our claim to a humane and civilized society.
A County Leaves Pot Growers Out of Joint
The Gold Rush of the late 1840s helped putCalaveras Countyon the map. After a devastating wildfire in 2015, the “green rush” of businesses growing out of recreational marijuana legalization helped this Northern California county rebuild. But after collecting millions in registration fees and taxes from growers, the county is now moving toban all commercial cultivationafter a vote by supervisors last month. The growers who paid all that money feel betrayed and are ready to sue.
What Puts the ‘Best’ in ‘Best Picture’?
When you hear the words“best picture Oscar,”what comes to mind? In the past, more often than not, it’s been a historical drama, an ode to Hollywood or a big musical. These days, as we head toward the Academy Awards on Sunday, it’s increasingly more difficult to pinpoint. Last year’s winner, “Moonlight,” was a surprise in more ways than one. Film critic Justin Chang saysits legacy can be seen in this year’s wide-open contest. As for what will win, Chang and his colleague Kenneth Turan have madetheir predictionsin the key races, andthis graphic showshow awards season has played out so far. And who knows? They might come in handy for filling out ourplay-at-home Oscars ballot.

"Orange County had delayed response to destructive wildfire, report says",https://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-oc-wildfire-20180330-story.html,2018-03-31,"A Southern California fire agency is overhauling its procedures after a report found that missteps delayed response to a wildfire last fall that burned 15 homes.
The Orange County Fire Authority announced Friday that the agency already has taken some steps to improve its dispatch and deployment, including additional training for fire dispatchers.
Assistant Chief Dave Anderson says the authority will make other needed changes as soon as possible.
A report Thursday by an independent review panel found that the fire authority didn’t adequately respond to 911 calls reporting flames in an area of the Anaheim Hills that would grown into the Canyon No. 2 fire.
Two callers reported the flames on Oct. 9 but the report says the fire authority didn’t send out a full response for more than an hour.
The fire burned 9,200 acres of brush.

"Op-Ed: Wildfires endanger not just lives, but city budgets too",https://www.latimes.com/opinion/op-ed/la-oe-rasker-fire-rebuilding-20180330-story.html,2018-03-30,"The cost of California’s historic 2017 wildfires has not been completely tallied but likely will reach into the hundreds of billions of dollars. What we do know is this: Cities and counties, in the end, will foot at least half of the bill.
This isn’t what people generally think happens after a natural disaster like a wildfire, when we imagine the Federal Emergency Management Agency and other taxpayer-funded agencies swooping in to help. But my research organization recently analyzed multiple studies calculating the full costs of a wildfire — including the losses that add up years later. The expense of putting out the flames — mostly borne by federal and state agencies like Cal Fire — represents only the first 9% of the total cost of a fire.
Then come the near-term losses: lost property, lost homes, aid for temporary shelter, fixing roads and stabilizing hillsides. Those add up to 35% of the total, and are paid for not just by FEMA, but also nongovernmental agencies like the Red Cross and insurance companies.
The bulk of fire costs — 65% of them — stem from long-term damages: depreciated property values, reduced property taxes, lost business revenue, infrastructure repair and degraded ecosystems that need rehabilitation.
Local government bodies pay at each of these stages, but particularly over the long haul. The result is that at least half of wildfire costs accrue to cities and counties.
Some communities bring a certain amount of this trouble on themselves. Eager for new tax revenues, local governments readily approve new subdivisions with little regard to fire hazards. In addition, our wave of retiring baby boomers loves living close to nature, so more homes are being built with national forests as their backyards. From 1990 to 2010, the number of new homes in the wildland-urban interface — where homes mingle with a flammable landscape — grew by 41%.
Meantime, fires got a lot bigger and more deadly — a trajectory likely to continue because of climate change. Compared with the 1990s, wildfires today burn twice as many acres on average. Wildfire suppression costs have tripled during that time span.
Communities often relax building standards after a devastating wildfire to speed up rebuilding. This is shortsighted and dangerous.
City councils and county commissions aren’t helpless in the face of these public safety and financial risks. A more stringent approach to land use planning is critical. In Missoula, Mont., for instance, detailed wildfire risk maps are used to direct future development out of harm’s way.
When new housing is allowed near forested land, building standards need to include using wildfire-resistant materials. Even in California, which is known for having some of the most forward-thinking rules on construction, communities often relax building standards after a devastating wildfire to speed up rebuilding. This is shortsighted and dangerous.
Some argue that fire-resistant materials are too costly and drive up the cost of housing. So for another study, done in partnership with the Insurance Institute for Business and Home Safety, we modeled a typical house and compared the cost of traditional construction to that of using recommended building materials, such as double-glazed windows with tempered glass and fire-resistant decking, and techniques such as covering roof vents with special screens. These upgrades increased the overall cost of a home only 5% to 10%.
A number of communities have taken this message to heart. Flagstaff, Ariz., and Wenatchee, Wash., are two that adopted regulations requiring wildfire-resistant construction after experiencing devastating fires.
Scores of communities across California are just now starting to confront what our research found: that the cost of the 2017 fires will burden local homeowners, businesses and governments for many years to come. Decisions on how and where to rebuild lie ahead for them, and this is the moment they should implement wildfire-resistant building policies, for the protection of both lives and city coffers.

Arizona honors 19 firefighters killed by flames 5 years ago,https://www.latimes.com/nation/la-na-arizona-hotshots-20180630-story.html,2018-07-01,"Reporting from PRESCOTT, Ariz. —Nineteen firefighters who died five years ago when they were overrun by a wildfire in a brush-choked canyon in Arizona were honored Saturday at a memorial service.
The event in Prescott featured bell tolls and the reading of the names of the Granite Mountain Hotshots who died June 30, 2013, in Yarnell, about 90 miles northwest of Phoenix.
The service also included a moment of silence at the time of their deaths.
The loss of nearly the entire crew reverberated across the country, becoming the deadliest day for firefighters since the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. The Granite Mountain Hotshots were the only such elite firefighting crew tied to a municipal fire department.
Over the years, markers of the men have sprung up around the communities they fought to protect.
A life-size bronze statue of a wildland firefighter stands at the trailhead of a state park created for them. A plaque near an alligator juniper tells the story of how the crew saved the giant tree.
A new learning and tribute center in Prescott features thousands of items that people left outside the crew’s fire station after they died, including T-shirts from other U.S. fire departments.
Next year, a sculpture of a wildland firefighter with the backdrop of Granite Mountain will be added to the city’s courthouse plaza.
“While there is no man-made memorial that could fully capture the true essence and spirit of our Granite Mountain Hotshots, I am confident that this memorial will do justice to their legacy and bring healing and hope to the families and our community,” Prescott Mayor Greg Mengarelli recently told the Daily Courier.
Some of the men’s families started organizations to honor their loved ones.
“If anything beautiful has come out of this tragedy, it is that people are being educated about the wildland community, not only the hotshots but smokejumpers, pounders, incident commanders, engine jumpers — the work they do and the danger they face,” Deborah Pfingston, one of the firefighters’ mothers, recently told the Arizona Republic.
A movie released last year, “Only the Brave,” chronicled the wildfire and the men’s final moments.
Investigators never determined exactly what happened. One investigation found that fire officials communicated poorly but followed proper procedure. A second blamed state officials for putting property protection ahead of safety and said crews should have been pulled out earlier.
The Granite Mountain Hotshots were on a ridge that already had burned before they moved into a canyon where winds shifted flames in their direction in Yarnell. They deployed fire shelters in a last-ditch effort to save themselves.
They were: Andrew Ashcraft, 29; Robert Caldwell, 23; Travis Carter, 31; Dustin DeFord, 24; Christopher MacKenzie, 30; Eric Marsh, 43; Grant McKee, 21; Sean Misner, 26; Scott Norris, 28; Wade Parker, 22; John Percin Jr., 24; Anthony Rose, 23; Jesse Steed, 36; Joe Thurston, 32; Travis Turbyfill, 27; William Warneke, 25; Clayton Whitted, 28; Kevin Woyjeck, 21; and Garret Zuppiger, 27.
Crosses now mark the spots where fire officials found the bodies. Memorial plaques and interpretive signs at the state park mark the trail leading to the site, surrounded by rock walls and chain link.
Only one of the crew members survived — Brendan McDonough was serving as the lookout in a different location.

This is the new normal: There are 17 serious wildfires burning throughout California, including one of the deadliest and most destructive in the state’s history.
Firefighters this month have been laboring under triple-digit temperatures and dry conditions to gain control over fires that have burned indiscriminately through residential neighborhoods, rolling hills and steep, forested terrain. The flames are stoked by dry brush and areas of dead trees, some of which haven’t burned in decades.
As of Tuesday, more than 12,300 firefighters were on the lines battling infernos that have burned more than 280,000 acres across the state.
“It’s a horrendous battle,” said Scott McLean, a deputy chief with the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection.
Four men have diedfighting the wildfires, and each of their deaths has highlighted the difficulties of fire containment.
Two died in the Ferguson fire weeks apart, one when his bulldozer overturned and another when a falling tree struck him. In the Carr fire, an 81-year-old private bulldozer contractor and a fire prevention inspector both died in Redding after flames swept through parts of the city Thursday night. The flames and heat were so intense, they created theirown weather systemand tornado-like winds. Four civilians died in the same conditions.
The Carr fire in Shasta County had burned 112,888 acres by Tuesday evening and crews increased containment to 30%. It has destroyed at least 1,378 structures — more than last year’s Thomas fire in Southern California — making it the sixth most destructive and the 13th deadliest wildfire in California history, according to state figures. The majority of the damage was in west Redding and some surrounding areas. As damage assessments continue, McLean expects the fire’s ranking to climb even higher.
About 22,000 Carr fire evacuees were allowed back into their homes by Tuesday night, but 15,000 remained displaced, McLean said.
Crews continued to build containment lines Tuesdaynight, hampered somewhat by shifting winds and steep terrain. Most of the fire activity now is on the northwest corner of the fire, McLean said, and the rising containment is a positive sign.
Of the largest fires in the state, firefighters have the least containment over the two blazes in Mendocino County — the Ranch and River fires. Together they have burned more than 80,000 acres and are 10% and 12% contained, respectively. The two fires have destroyed 10 structures so far.
Those fires both ignited Friday and are burning largely in rural areas that include some rolling hills as well as rugged slopes. Firefighters are battling “a little bit of everything,” including dry fuel, weather and terrain, McLean said.
Firefighters faced wind gusts up to 17 mph Monday night and could see westerly gusts of up to 20 mph through Tuesday evening, National Weather Service meteorologist Cory Mueller said. On Monday night, firefighters worked to extinguish spot fires, according to a fire incident report.
Firefighters were also contending with two new wildfires that ignited Tuesday afternoon. The Eel fire charred 865acres in a sparsely populated area east of Covelo in Mendocino County, while the Butte fire scorched 800acres northwest of Yuba City in Sutter County. The Butte fire was 40% contained late Tuesday.
The Ferguson fire, near Yosemite National Park, has burned through 58,074 acres. The fire has raged in rugged forest terrain, with pockets of dangerous dead brush, grass and trees that have not seen flames for close to a century. As of Tuesday, the fire was 33% contained. Although only one structure has been lost in the fire, two firefighters were killed and nineothers injured, according to authorities.
There will be a slight cooling of temperatures over the Carr and Mendocino fires on Wednesday and Thursday that will be barely noticeable to firefighters, but it could help them continue to gain control of the wildfires, authorities said.
The rapid spread and high level of destruction of these recent fires is “a new normal,” McLean said. Of the state’s20 most destructive wildfires, a quarter of them ignited in either October or December of last year. Topping the list is last year’s Tubbs fire, which killed 22 people and destroyed 5,636 structures when it sped through the city of Santa Rosa.
Nationally, there are more than 60 uncontained large fires burning in the Western United States,according to federal authorities.
In Southern California, the Cranston fire near Hemet was 89% contained Tuesday evening after burning 13,139 acres and destroying five homes.
A common thread in the California fires this yearis extreme heat, the likes of which the state has never seen in the modern historical record.
In the past, there has been some reluctance among scientists to cite climate change as a major factor in California’s worsening wildfires. Human-caused ignitions and homes being built ever closer to forests have played a large role. But the connection between rising temperatures in California and tinder-dry vegetation is becoming impossible to ignore, according to experts who study climate and wildfires.
And it’s not just the biggest wildfires statewide that are taking a toll on firefighters — they’re also dispatched to quickly extinguish smaller brush fires and prevent them from spreading, McLean said.
“Last week alone, during the week, you had over 1,000 wildfire responses,” he said. “Commonly this time of year it’s maybe 250 to 300.”
In the Railroad fire,a 10-acre brush fire in Santa Clarita that ignited Monday afternoon, three firefighters suffered minor burns and smoke inhalation. It was 95% contained by Tuesday evening, according to the Los Angeles County Fire Department. At least 13 units in two residential structures were damaged.
Concerned citizens across the state have asked how they can help, offering to bring water and food to base camps. But that’s not what firefighters need from the public, McLean said.
“The best thing you can do for the firefighters is to be prepared — be prepared to leave, make sure your family’s educated onwhat to do,” he said. “And when it’s time, leave. Do not stay.”

Four still missing in Redding and Old Shasta after destructive Carr fire,https://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-ln-carr-fire-missing-20180731-story.html,2018-08-01,"Authorities in Shasta County are looking for four people who remain missing after the deadly Carr fire swept through neighborhoods and destroyed hundreds of homes.
Investigators found 16 other people safe Tuesday afternoon, within about two hours of releasing a list of names of people they had not been able to reach. Many of the residents fled their homes so quickly that they left behind their cellphones or chargers.
“This fire moved through our city so fast that a lot of people left their homes in such a hurry, they didn’t bring their electronic devices with them,” said Redding Police Sgt. Todd Cogle.
The four who remain missing are:
Brown lived in a mobile home park, and authorities said his residence may have been destroyed. “I just know that Old Shasta was hit pretty hard,” Cogle said.
Investigators confirmed that the homes of the three missing Redding residents remain intact, Cogle said. Since Friday, authorities have taken 60 missing persons reports.
The Carr fire had burned 112,888 acres by Tuesday evening and crews increased containment to 30%. The blaze has destroyed at least 1,378 structures — more than last year’s Thomas fire in Southern California — making it the 13th deadliest wildfire in California history and one of the most destructive, according to state figures.
The majority of the damage was in west Redding and some surrounding areas. As damage assessments continue, authorities expect the fire’s ranking to climb even higher.
Anyone with information on the people unaccounted for is asked to call the Missing Persons Hotline at (530) 225-4277.

Newsletter: Essential California: Why the fires are so bad,https://www.latimes.com/newsletters/la-me-ln-essential-california-20180731-story.html,2018-07-31,"Good morning, and welcome to the Essential Californianewsletter. It’sTuesday, July 31,and here’s what’s happening across California:
TOP STORIES
California is in the midst of its worst string of wildfires —dozens dead since October,with more than 10,000 structures lost from San Diego to Redding. There are many reasons why the last 10 months have been so bad for California. But there’s also a common factor playing a key role: As the world’s climate changes, the state has been facing extreme heat, the likes of which California has never seen before in the modern historical record. “The temperatures have just been almost inexorably warmer all the time,” said UCLA climate scientist Daniel Swain, and fires “burn more intensely if the fuels are extremely dry.”Los Angeles Times
-- Authorities on Monday werehoping that a slight break in the heat this weekcould help them gain control of a number of wildfires that have so far scorched more than 200,000 acres and killed eight people across California.Los Angeles Times
--Eight people have diedthis year in California wildfires. Here are some of their stories.Los Angeles Times

Street racing for the retweets
Popular Instagram accounts,YouTube channels and other forms of social media have served as a bullhorn for Los Angeles’ street-racing community in recent years, law enforcement officials and members of the racing community say. The larger a car club or race organizer’s online following, the easier it can draw large crowds to illegal events. The platforms have helped expand Los Angeles’ reputation as a proving ground for car clubs from as far away as San Bernardino and Oakland, allowing regional rivalries to gain steam through online wars of words and video clips of racers performing on their home turf.Los Angeles Times

AND FINALLY
Today’s California memory comes fromGretchen Allen:
“It’s 6 a.m. in August 1984, and I’m 16 years old. I’ve been up since 5, prepping frozen fruit and chilled juices for the high school football team as they go into ‘hell week,’ a.k.a. ‘2 a days,’ in this insufferable high desert heat. The beauty of the San Gabriel Mountains, looming above us and giving a moment of comfort as the sun slowly rises from her base, is breathtaking. The guys lumber in, all fortified with fresh summer growth spurts and sexy tans, avoiding eye contact as they can’t afford the distraction. We pass out the cool, hydrating treats in silence, as the promise of a new school year fills our ears with the clap of the pads and the groans of defensive linemen. I wonder to myself how many other schools across the Golden State are eating frozen watermelon right now as I contemplate my last year of high school. I have never felt more alive.”

TOP STORIES
Where There’s Heat, There’s Fire
In the past, scientists have been reluctant to citeclimate changeas a major factor in California’s worsening wildfires. Not anymore. Experts in the field say the connection between rising temperatures in California and tinder-dry vegetation is becoming impossible to ignore. “The temperatures have just been almost inexorably warmer all the time,” says UCLA climate scientist Daniel Swain, and fires “burn more intensely if the fuels are extremely dry.” The death and destruction this month has only added toCalifornia’s worst wildfire year on record, which has left dozens dead since October and more than 10,000 structures lost.Here is the latest.
Trump’s Base in China Erodes
President Trumppreaches “America first,” but he’s had his fans on social media in the People’s Republic of China. Since placing tariffs on Chinese goods and targeting other Beijing-led policies, though, many of those fan accounts have quieted down andthe criticism has gotten louder. One of Trump’s most popular nicknames on the Chinese version of Twitter is now Chuangpo, which means “to charge in and break things.”

The common thread in California’s wildfires: heat like the state has never seen,https://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-fires-heat-20180731-story.html,2018-07-31,"Firefighters are battling 17 wildfires across the state, which have consumed more than 200,000 acres combined in terrain stretching from Southern California to the Oregon border
Reporting from REDDING —The northern Sacramento Valley was well on its way to recording the hottest July on record when the Carr fire swept into town Thursday.
It was 113 degrees, and months of above-average temperatures had left the land bone-dry and ready to explode.Within a few hours,hundreds of structures werelost and six people killed.
The destruction adds to California’s worst wildfire year on record — dozens dead since October, with more than 10,000 structures lost from San Diego to Redding.
There are many reasons for the grim totals, but experts say one common denominator connects the disastrous fires: California is facing extreme heat, the likes of which it has never seen in the modern historical record.
“The temperatures have just been almost inexorably warmer all the time,” said UCLA climate scientist Daniel Swain, and fires “burn more intensely if the fuels are extremely dry.”
In the past, there has been some reluctance among scientists to cite climate change as a major factor in California’s worsening wildfires. Human-caused ignitions and homes being built ever closer to forests have played a large role. But the connection between rising temperatures in California and tinder-dry vegetation is becoming impossible to ignore, according to experts who study climate and wildfires.
“The regional temperatures in the western U.S. have increased by 2 degrees since the 1970s,” said Jennifer Balch, director of Earth Lab at the University of Colorado, Boulder. “You’re seeing the effect of climate change.”

Neil Lareau, assistant professor of atmospheric sciences at the University of Nevada, Reno, said unusual warmth is now routine, and that heat “leads to drying things out quicker.”
Vegetation can have various degrees of dryness — a wet log in the woods could smolder before puttering out, while tinder-dry chaparral on a 110-degree day could explode when ignited, Swain said. Extremely flammable vegetation can create a particularly intense fire with the potential to grow much faster — leaving less time for firefighters to get a handle on a blaze and for people to escape.
“What that means is the fire has to do less work to ignite the vegetation right next to it. And it can spread faster, and it releases energy more quickly,” Lareau said.
The Carr fire is the most destructive of 17 major blazes burning amid the current hot conditions. Fires in Mendocino County, in the San Jacinto Mountains and near Yosemite National Park exploded in the last few days, eating through dry wildlands. Authorities said they hope to gain more control over the Carr fire as temperatures gradually cool this week.
Swain said California is seeing more fires spreading much faster than what was customary. “It’s just that much easier for fires to escape initial control,” he said.
According to Swain, an ominous warning sign before each of the major fires of the last year — including last fall’s catastrophic Santa Rosa blaze — was alerts about record or near-record dryness in the vegetation.
The effect of temperature — and how dry the vegetation is — can matter more than how much rain or snow fell the previous winter.
Northern California saw its wettest winter on record in 2016-17, followed by its warmest summer. That led to extremely dry vegetation by the fall — just before the devastating Santa Rosa fire hit, Swain said.
“Temperature can clearly out-influence the precipitation,” he said.
Hot, dry conditions and aridity of vegetation are translating to increased wildfire risk worldwide, said John Abatzoglou, associate professor of geography at the University of Idaho.
Abatzoglou was the lead author of a recentstudythat concluded human-caused climate change was responsible for more than half of the increase in dry vegetation in the western United States since the 1970s — which doubled the area of forest charred since 1984. The influence of human-caused climate change on the extreme dryness of vegetation “is projected to increasingly promote wildfire potential across western U.S. forests in the coming decades, and pose threats to ecosystems, the carbon budget, human health and fire suppression budgets,” Abatzoglou wrote in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.
Making matters worse, nighttime temperatures generally are not dropping as low as they once did, meaning the chance of a blaze weakening overnight is reduced. California’s average summer minimum temperature was at a record high last year at 61.9 degrees, up from 56.5 degrees from the first year on record in 1895.
“Some of these fires burn into the overnight hours — that’s typically the time of day fires calm down and firefighters get a better handle on these things,” Abatzoglou said.
By many measures, literally and figuratively, California has been burning up.
As the Carr fire rapidly expanded, the Redding area was experiencing record-tying temperatures. In Southern California in October and November — in the middle of a punishing spate of wildfires — the average temperature was thehottestin more than 120 years of record keeping. San Francisco hit itsall-time heat recordin September, with a downtown reading of 106; in July, all-time temperature recordsshattered throughout Southern California, with Burbank hitting 114 and Van Nuys 117.
Redding’s temperature of 113 on Thursday wasn’t unheard of for that time of year, but Swain said it was the accumulation of intense heat over the previous weeks and months that added to the problem.
The resulting dry vegetation was a key factor in the Carr fire, Swain said. There was no wind preceding the blaze in Redding — no Santa Anas or Diablos whipping it up. Instead, the exceptionally dry vegetation produced intense heat that shot hot air up to 39,000 feet into the sky at speeds of up to 130 mph, Lareau said. That air was replaced by air moving in at the base of the fire, in a movement that appeared like a tornado.
“This fire vortex, this pretty terrifying tornado-like feature, and I don’t say that lightly … was made possible by the extreme heat produced by this fire,” Swain said. “To see that in the brush- and mixed-forest region immediately adjacent to a city of 100,000 people in California was pretty extraordinary.”
Such “fire whirls,” also known as plume-dominated fires, are particularly dangerous because the direction of the blaze is far more difficult to predict and embers can spread far away. It’s believed to be a factor in the number of lives lost in the fire, including firefighters. The Carr fire jumped the Sacramento River, which in a typical blaze would be seen as a natural barrier.
“The fire has much more of a mind of its own when it has more of these dynamics,” Lareau said.
It’s virtually unheard of for a fire whirl to last as long as the one in Redding did — it started about 7 p.m. Thursday and lasted for about an hour and a half. “It’s remarkable in size, strength, duration and depth,” he said.
The fire whirl was so intense that it appeared to blow down large trees and strip tiles off roofs in areas that were untouched by fire damage.
According to the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection, the state’s wildfire season is now 78 days longer than it was more than a generation ago.
“You don’t get a record hot July by accident right now. It’s just the whole background state of the climate is hotter. The entire Earth is hotter than it used to be,” Lareau said.

Firefighters try to make progress on 17 fires that cut path of destruction,https://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-fires-mainbar-20180731-story.html,2018-07-31,"Reporting from REDDING, CALIF. —The neighborhood looked like a patch quilt of destruction. One home, reduced to a heap of smoldering rubble. Next door, another home stood unscathed.
The pattern continued until Elizabeth Barkley, acting commander of the California Highway Patrol’s Northern Division, drove up to her own property in Redding and confirmed what she’d already heard: Her home was gone.
“I realized I’m just one of the many that is going to be in this situation,” Barkley said from a hotel room. “All these fires are so hard on towns.”
In all, the deadly Carr fire had claimed six lives, devoured 818 homes and burned more than 103,000 acres by Monday night, leaving behind a trail of devastation as firefighters struggled to get a handle on flames. Crews had increased containment to 23%, marking significant progress on the largest and most destructive of at least 17 wildfires burning across the state. In some areas, thousands of weary residents were allowed to return home.
“We’re starting to feel good about where we are going,” Bret Gouvea, incident commander with the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection, told more than 300 residents at a community meeting Monday afternoon. “Things are getting better, but we have a long road ahead. But trust me, we will get there.”
A day before she lost her home, Barkley spent hours frantically knocking on doors imploring residents to pack up and go. Covered in ash and sweat, she helped direct traffic out of the city. She said her fiance, an emergency room doctor, was seeing people with burns and elderly residents who had broken bones in falls while evacuating.
Still, she never thought the blaze would actually hit her neighborhood.
She was on her way to a briefing Friday morning where she’d help decide where up to 200 CHP personnel would be deployed that day. Her phone buzzed — a lieutenant was calling.
“I don’t know how to tell you this,” she recalled him saying. “Your house is gone.”
“Shut up,” she told him. “No way.”
“Chief,” he said, “Your house is gone.”
When the loss set in, she thought of things she’d never see again. The christening gowns of her two daughters that she hoped to one day pass down to their girls. Her grandmother’s china that held years of memories from Christmases and Thanksgivings.
“Things you can’t replace,” Barkley said, later adding: “At the end of the day, it’s just stuff.”
When she drove up to the rubble, Barkley noticed one thing that didn’t burn: Her American flag was still flying outside her home, untouched.
Officials said they expect containment on the Carr fire to increase in the next 24 hours, though crews were hampered by searing temperatures and dry weather. Winds were also expected to pick up overnight. On its west flank, firefighters were setting back fires, a tactic used to stop the fire from spreading. To the north, the fire continued to burn in wilderness, while the eastern flank was not as active.
“The terrain is just awful and difficult to access. It’s just inaccessible in a lot of areas,” said Dominic Polito, a spokesman for the Carr fire. “If you were to walk up it, you’d be looking at your knee on every step.”
Among those killed in the Carr fire were a woman and her two great-grandchildren. The woman’s husband, Ed Bledsoe, told CBS News that he did not receive an evacuation warning before the blaze tore through their home, raising questions about how authorities alerted residents.
“If I’d have any kind of warning, I’d have never, ever left my family in that house,” Bledsoe said.
Shasta County Sheriff Tom Bosenko said his department was looking into whether a deputy had knocked at the woman’s home. He said authorities notified residents of the fire danger in several ways, including tapping a system that makes 911 reverse calls on landline phones.
In Mendocino County, a pair of fires exploded to more than 68,000 acres. By Monday night, they were 5% contained.
The Mendocino Complex fires are “the most active” in that county right now, said Scott McLean, deputy chief with Cal Fire. “The smaller fires we had going are starting to wrap up, which is good news.”
In Southern California, the Cranston fire near Idyllwild was 82% contained Monday, after burning 13,139 acres and five homes since it started last week. A brushfire that erupted in Santa Clarita on Monday afternoon scorched 10 acres and partially burned a residential complex before firefighters got a handle on it.
In Redding, authorities are patrolling the empty town and arrested two men Sunday night on suspicion of unauthorized entry into an enclosed area, according toRedding police.
Authorities also arrested two other people Sunday afternoon in Shasta County on suspicion of looting, after deputies found that the front door to a home in an evacuated area had been forced open, and electronic items were stacked by the door, according toa Shasta County sheriff’s statement. Redding residents Jack Fannin, 19, and Jade Ball, 25, were arrested and booked at Shasta County Jail.
News of possible looters had shaken some residents.
Lake Redding resident James Anderson placed multiple motion sensors throughout his yellow wood-frame home on Hartland Drive. “I put one by the porch so that I know who’s coming,” he said Monday. “I put one on the side gate. The other day it had been left open and I had it closed.”
Anderson, 74, said home burglaries are already a problem in the area. Although evacuations were ordered for his neighborhood, Anderson said he decided to stay to make sure his home was safe. He said firefighters brought him cans of soup during the first few nights of the fire, but now his food supply was dwindling.
He’s now contemplating using his mountain bike to take side trails into town to pick up food and sneak back in. He’s not sure what will happen if he runs into any authorities.
“If they hassle me, I’m just going to tell them to go to hell,” Anderson said.
Shasta County Dist. Atty. Stephani A. Bridgett said her office has received 60 complaints about price gouging and intends to investigate. The state’s anti-price gouging statute prohibits businesses from raising the price of many goods and services by more than 10% during an emergency.
Robert Seals, 71, said he looks forward to when things go back to normal in Redding.
“They don’t want to let anyone in until they checked the entire neighborhood,” he said. “I’m patient, but it’s frustrating not to go in where there’s no problem.”

"Brush fire breaks out in Santa Clarita, damaging multiple units in two residential complexes",https://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-ln-santa-clarita-fire-20180730-story.html,2018-07-31,"A brush fire erupted in Santa Clarita on Monday afternoon, scorching 10 acres as it raced toward homes and burned part of a residential complex, officials said.
The blaze damaged 13 units in two residential complexes when embers traveled through the vents during the firefight, said Los Angeles County Fire Inspector Joey Marron. By late Monday, it was 85% contained and forward progress had been stopped.
The blaze broke out near 20900 Via Estrella after 4 p.m., with smoke visible from a mile away, according to the Los Angeles County Fire Department. The blaze quickly ran uphill, threatening multiple structures.
Three fire personnel, including a captain, sustained minor injuries. Two were treated for minor burns, while one was treated for smoke inhalation. No building residents were injured.

At least one building caught fire, sending thick black smoke in the air, according to live television footage. Flames were burning bushes several feet away as sheriff’s deputies tried to get into at least one unit. It’s unclear if the building was occupied.
Fire crews mounted an aggressive attack, making water drops from a helicopter while firefighters on the ground fought flames with hoses.
The blaze erupted as firefighters across the state are battlingmore than a dozen wildfiresthat together have charred more than 200,000 acres and stretched fire resources thin.At least eight peoplehave died in the fires.

Editorial: When fire season lasts all year long,https://www.latimes.com/opinion/editorials/la-ed-carr-fire-wildfires-climate-change-20180730-story.html,2018-07-30,"The devastatingCarr firein Northern California continues to ravage the countryside, nearing — if not already surpassing — 100,000 acres, destroying at least 874 buildings and, even more tragically, killing six people with an additional seven people unaccounted for. To the southeast, two men — one a firefighter and the other a bulldozer operator — died fighting the 57,000-acreFerguson firenear Yosemite National Park. There were 15 other fires raging elsewhere in California, includingtwo fresh firesforcing evacuations in Mendocino and Lake counties. And it’s not just California that’s burning. As of Monday morning,at least 90 large fireswere reported nationwide, all in the West except for a blaze in Florida.
Such fires arenothing newin this part of the country. But the fire season this year hasbegun much earlierthan usual, and while scientists warn that specific weather conditions cannot be tied directly to climate change, these are just the sorts of impacts we have been warned to expect from a warming planet.
For the record:
9:25 a.m. July 31, 2018An earlier version of this editorial incorrectly referred to a mudslide this year in Mendocino. The debris flow was in Montecito.
In fact, prolonged drought is a major factor in the current fires. Years of drought, broken by a rainy 2016-2017 winter followed by an unusually dry winter last year, have left the countryside covered with dead or dormant plants. In the mountains, drought damage has been augmented bybark beetle infestationsthat have left more than 100 million trees dead on their roots in California alone. All of that organic material is kindling and fuel for an errant spark or a bolt of lightning. And if heavy rains come in the aftermath of a fire, the charred landscape becomes the setting for deadly mudslides like those that flowed throughMontecitoearlier this year.
As the world continues to burn fossil fuels, and climate change becomes more pronounced, we have to recognize that this isn’t nature just doing its thing.
The loss of life has been heartbreaking. Three of the Carr fire victims were 70-year-oldMelody Bledsoeand two great-grandchildren who perished near Redding as a wall of flames sped through their neighborhood. In the Sierra Nevada, 33-year-oldBrian Hughes, a “hotshot” firefighter, died when he was struck by a falling tree as he and colleagues raced to set a backfire to stanch the Ferguson fire. Firefighters foundanother unidentified bodySunday in the ashes of a different home near Redding, and it seems likely that more remains will be found elsewhere in the days to come.
Few areas of the state are immune from wildfires, and no Californian can shake the sense as we watch the smoke and rising death counts that there but for the grace of the prevailing winds go I. We know what we’re supposed to do: Maintain brush-free areas around homes in fire-prone areas, have an escape plan laid out, resist the urge for heroics and flee when authorities say so. But as the world continues to burn fossil fuels for energy, and climate change becomes more pronounced, we have to recognize that this isn’t nature just doing its thing. We have through our actions endangered ourselves, a reality we must recognize and rectify as quickly and forcefully as possible.
Enter the Fray: First takes on the news of the minute from L.A. Times Opinion »
Part of the responsibility falls on state and local officials, who must deal with the rising cost of fire prevention and suppression. State lawmakers recently began hammering out a more balanced approach to assigning liability when power lines cause a fire. Under current law, homeowners can collect from utilities even if the utilities were not negligent. With the state’s fiery future, that’s likely to lead to financial ruin for the power companies. Local planners and developers can also do more to consider wildfire risks as they make land-use decisions, and we need to adopt policies that make it easier to develop urban areas at higher levels of density.
But such moves only help address the impacts of the wildfires and mudslides. To get at the root of the problem we must more radically reduce our dependence on fossil fuels for energy and transportation. The Trump administration’s “burn, burn, burn” approach to fossil fuel is no help on that front. The evidence of the horrible impacts is right before the nation’s eyes, yet the administration is looking at ways it can undo California’s efforts to reduce carbon emissions from motor vehicles.
At the moment, there is mourning to be done over the lives lost in the current conflagrations, and there are fires to be contained as well as damage to be assessed and dealt with. But we also must not lose sight of the fact that we can mitigate some of the dangers we face in the future by acting now. We just need the political will to do so.

Oscar de la Renta goes local with Lotusland benefit and Montecito pop-up,https://www.latimes.com/fashion/la-ig-wwd-oscar-de-la-renta-montecito-pop-up-20180730-story.html,2018-07-30,"First Newport, then Mykonos.Oscar de la Rentais buying into the summer pop-up trend with a temporary boutique at the Montecito Country Mart through end of August 2018. The independent retail collective – sister to the Brentwood Country Mart and a similar concept in Marin – is known for a rustic charm that embodies the Santa Barbara lifestyle.
The boutique, designed by Jeang Kim, sister ofOscar de la Renta’s co-creative director Laura Kim, occupies 1,150 square feet and offers ready-to-wear, handbags, shoes and fashion jewelry from the pre-fall 2018 and fall 2018 collections. The boutique will also sell items from the childrenswear line, Oscar de la Renta x Morgenthal Frederics sunglasses and a selective assortment of pieces from the Mykonos capsule collection consisting of tunics, caftans, palazzo pants, swimwear and beach towels inspired by the Greek island.
In order to aid efforts of the town’s recovery from the devastating mudslides of January 2018, 10 percent of all sales will be donated to the Santa Barbara Bucket Brigade, an organization dedicated to the restoration and salvation of local homes.
“With the continued success of our boutique on Melrose Place in West Hollywood and our wholesale partners throughout the state of California, it makes tremendous sense for us to join our customer in Santa Barbara,” said Alex Bolen, chief executive officer of Oscar de la Renta. “Most of our retail business is based on local customers and we try to make connections in communities where our customers are. The Country Mart is a different tenant mix for us, but it very much services the local community and is hopefully an opportunity to get tourists as well. We can stock it from ourLos Angelesboutique, the same way we do in Mykonos with our Athens store.”
To highlight the new boutique, the house was a premier sponsor of Saturday night’s Lotusland Gala in Santa Barbara, showing pre-fall and fall 2018 looks including botanical prints from the collections displayed against the backdrop of Lotusland’s lush gardens.
The hottest ticket in Santa Barbara’s summer social scene, “Lotusland Celebrates: Gems of the Garden” celebrates Lotusland’s founder, Madame Ganna Walska and benefits her world-renowned botanical garden. This year’s event also drew influencers Garance Doré, Chriselle Lim, Marianna Hewitt, Brittany Xavier and Dani Song, who posted about the festivities on behalf of de la Renta.
“Oscar was a huge fan of Lotusland. When we’d come toLos Angelesin spring for The Colleagues luncheon, he’d say, ‘We have to go to Lotusland.’ He actually made a small part of his garden in the Dominican Republics based on Lotusland,” said Bolen.
He noted Californian’s resilience in bouncing back from natural disasters, which continue this summer with the wildfires. Bolen, who took his son Henry as his date this year while also doing West Coast college tours, will be back for the annual Lake Tahoe benefit with Saks Fifth Avenue next week.

At least 8 dead as wildfires continue to rage across California,https://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-ln-fires-20180730-story.html,2018-07-30,"Firefighters are battling 17 wildfires across the state, which have consumed more than 200,000 acres combined in terrain stretching from Southern California to the Oregon border
Authorities on Monday were hoping that a slight break in the heat this week could help them gain control of a number of wildfires that have so far scorched more than 200,000 acres and killed eight people across California.
The Carr fire, which erupted in Shasta County a week ago and spread into the city of Redding, grew to 103,772 acres and was 23% contained as of Monday evening. The fire has destroyed more than 1,000 structures and claimed six lives, including a fire inspector, a bulldozer operator, a great-grandmother and her two great-grandchildren. Two other deaths have been attributed to the Ferguson fire near Yosemite.
“The terrain is just awful and difficult to access, it’s just inaccessible in a lot of areas,” Dominic Polito, a spokesman for fire authorities, said of the Carr fire. “If you were to walk up it, you’d be looking at your knee on every step.”
The focus Monday will be to prevent the fire from spreading farther into Trinity County, Polito said.
“Firefighters worked through the night to build control lines. Today crews will work to mitigate potential spot fires as shifting winds, dry fuels and steep drainages exist below control lines,” according to an incident report on the Carr fire.
Someevacuations were liftedin Redding on Monday morning, but mandatory evacuations remained in place in Shasta and Trinity counties, and authorities are warning people to stay away from blocked off areas. In Redding, law enforcement agencies patrolled the 17 square miles that were vacant over the weekend and arrested two men Sunday night on charges of unauthorized entry into an enclosed area, according toRedding police.
Authorities also arrested two other people Sunday afternoon in Shasta County on suspicion of looting, after deputies found that the front door to a home had been forced open in an evacuated area, and electronic items were stacked by the door, according toa Shasta County sheriff’s statement.

Redding residents Jack Fannin, 19, and Jade Ball, 25, were arrested and booked at Shasta County Jail.
Two fires in Mendocino County — the River and Ranch fires — also continued to grow Monday. Combined, they covered more than 68,000 acres, with 5% containment by Monday evening. Firefighters battled “extreme” fire weather throughout the night, and “weather conditions will continue to challenge firefighters as hot, dry and windy conditions persist,” according to the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection incident report.
Weather over the Carr fire around Redding, as well as over the two fires in Mendocino County, was expected to be hot and dry Monday, with temperatures in the mid-to-upper 90s above the Carr fire and in the low 90s in Mendocino County, according to National Weather Service meteorologist Cory Mueller.
Though the fires are not wind-driven, expected gusts up to 20 mph Monday afternoon could affect firefighting efforts in both areas, Mueller said.
By midweek, forecasters expect temperatures to drop slightly, though it will still be hot, Mueller said.
The massive Ferguson fire that has accounted for two firefighter deaths and prompted the closure of portions of nearby Yosemite National Park, grew to 57,041 acres, and remained 30% contained.
Authorities lifted some evacuations in Mariposa on and around East Westfall Road, warning that they could be placed under mandatory evacuation again if conditions change.

Authorities announced Sunday that Capt. Brian Hughes, of the Arrowhead Interagency Hotshots, wasstruck and killedby a falling tree when his crew was “preparing tactical firing operations,” Sequoia and Kings Canyon National Parks saidin a statement.
“Hughes was with the Arrowhead Hotshots for four years and will be dearly missed by everyone at the parks. We grieve his loss.”
In Southern California, the Cranston fire near Idyllwild was 82% contained Monday, after burning 13,139 acres last week.
The fires have also affected air quality across the region, including areas of Nevada.
“Fires in California and western Nevada continue to produce heavy amounts of smoke region wide. While air quality is worse closer to fires… all western Nevada and Sierra valley locations are experiencing diminished air quality to some degree,” according to a National Weather Service alert from Reno.
Word that police had arrested possible looters near the Carr fire had shaken some area residents.
Lake Redding resident James Anderson had placed multiple motion sensors throughout his yellow wood-frame home on Hartland Drive. “I put one by the porch so that I know who’s coming,” he said Monday. “I put one on the side gate. The other day it had been left open and I had it closed.”
Anderson, 74, said home burglaries are already a problem in the area. Although evacuations were ordered for his neighborhood, Anderson said he decided to stay behind to make sure his home was safe. He said firefighters brought him cans of soup during the first few nights of the fire, but now his food supply was dwindling.
He’s now contemplating using his mountain bike to take side trails into town to pick up food and sneak back in. He’s not sure what will happen if he runs into any authorities. “If they hassle me, I’m just going to tell them to go to hell,” Anderson said.

The Tragedy of California’s Wildfires
The death toll from the wildfires in Californiahas continued to rise, with eight fatalities reported — two fire crew members in theFerguson firenear Yosemite and six people in theCarr firein and around Redding. Among the six were a 70-year-old woman and her two great-grandchildren,whom she tried to savewith a wet blanket. Across the state, about 12,000 firefighters are battling 17 blazes. With many fires burning near populated areas,resources are spread thin, and engines have been summoned from as far away as Florida. But officials did express some hope in battling the Carr fire, which has alsodestroyed more than 870 structures: Cooler temperatures and increased humidity should give firefighters a chance to contain more of it.

Death toll mounts as wildfires rage across California,https://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-ln-new-carr-fire-mainbar-20180729-story.html,2018-07-30,"Firefighters are battling 17 wildfires across the state, which have consumed more than 200,000 acres combined in terrain stretching from Southern California to the Oregon border
Reporting from Redding, Calif. —The death toll from the state’s wildfires continued to mount Sunday, with eight fatalities now reported from blazes burning in Shasta County and near Yosemite National Park.
In Mariposa County, where firefighters have spent weeks battling the Ferguson fire, officials reported that a firefighter based at Sequoia and Kings Canyon National Parks died after being struck by a falling tree. Meanwhile, crews attacking the Carr fire in and around Redding said they had located another body — the fourth civilian to perish in that blaze — and reported that hundreds more structures were destroyed.
For the record:
10:25 a.m. July 30, 2018An earlier version of this article said that Yosemite National Park was closed due to the fire. Only parts of the park, including Yosemite Valley, are closed.
Firefighters are battling17 wildfires across the state, which have consumed more than 200,000 acres combined in terrain stretching from Southern California to the Oregon border, said Jonathan Cox, battalion chief and information officer with the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection. With so many burning near populated areas, “resources are obviously stretched thin,” he said.
“We’ve had 17 fires before,” Cox said. “But these are impacting communities — and they’re large fires, not small.”

About 12,000 firefighters have responded to the wildfires from within California. Another 800 personnel have been deployed by the California National Guard. And 150 fire engines were on the way from as far away as Florida, officials said Sunday. “There’s a finite number of resources in California, and obviously we’re employing them at the highest-priority incidents,” Cox said.
The Carr fire — the largest wildfire currently burning — has consumed more than 95,000 acres, destroyed 874 structures — including 657 residential structures — and damaged 175 others. Six people, including a 70-year-old woman and two of her great-grandchildren, ages 4 and 5, were killed in the fast-moving fire. Two belonged to the crews fighting the fire. Authorities were also investigating seven missing persons cases.

The devastation astounded Shasta County Supervisor Leonard Moty, who represents much of the area that burned. “I’ve been a lifelong resident of this community. I’ve never seen a fire with such destruction here in this area ever before,” said Moty, appearing at a news conference with other public safety officials.
One of those who experienced the destruction firsthand was Redding resident Hannalora Lewis, who was woken up by her mother Thursday morning and told to evacuate.
While her parents grabbed photos and corralled their dogs, the 16-year-old scooped up her phone, an outfit and a new pair of sneakers she bought while back-to-school shopping. She said she almost grabbed a box of mementos — trinkets, diaries, ticket stubs from her favorite movies — but then thought it would take up too much room in the car.
Within days, she learned the family’s house had been destroyed. “I didn’t think for a second that we would lose our home,” she said.
Firefighters on Sunday offered their first optimistic assessment of their battle against the Carr fire, which has forced more than 38,000 residents to evacuate. Cal Fire unified incident commander Bret Gouvea said cooler temperatures and increased humidity had given firefighters a window of opportunity to attack the massive fire.
The blaze, which was 17% contained Sunday evening, was mostly burning north into remote and inaccessible areas. Fire crews also managed to halt the spread of the Carr fire within the city of Redding, Gouvea said.
“We’ve had no movement on the fire over the last day inside the city limits, so things are looking very good,” he added.
Craig Shoemaker, a meteorologist in the National Weather Service’s Sacramento office, said temperatures right over the fire are expected to reach highs of up to 105 degrees Monday, a few degrees cooler than it would have been without thick smoke acting as a cloud cover.
“An incredible amount of smoke has been put into the air, and that’s helping to hold down temperatures a little bit,” said Tom Dang, another meteorologist with the weather service.
While the smoke provided some relief for crews on the ground, it complicated the aerial assault on the fire being waged by helicopters and air tankers, limiting their visibility. “There’s a lot of low-level smoke, which means missions are having to be aborted,” said Cox, the Cal Fire spokesman.
Investigators said Sunday they had recovered the body of a sixth person from the Carr fire. Although he declined to identify the person, Shasta County Sheriff Tom Bosenko said the latest fire victim had been in a location where residents had been told to clear out for their safety.
“We have confirmed that the person did receive evacuation notices and did not evacuate,” he said.
Officials also said there have now been two fatalities in the Ferguson fire, which has consumed more than 54,000 acres near Yosemite. That fire, which started July 13, claimed the life of a Cal Fire bulldozer operator, whose vehicle tumbled down a hillside during the building of a defensive line.
On Sunday, Brian Hughes, captain of the Arrowhead Interagency Hotshots, was killed when he was struck by a tree while he and his team were setting a backfire in an area with many dead trees on the east side of the fire, according to the National Park Service. He was treated at the scene but died before he could be taken to a hospital. He was 33.
Hughes, who was originally from Hilo, Hawaii, had worked with the Arrowhead hotshots for four years. They are an elite crew of 20 firefighters based at Sequoia and Kings Canyon National Parks.
“They go into the steepest of the steep, the most rugged of the rugged areas,” said Mike Theune, a spokesman with the parks. The Arrowhead team, one of two hotshot crews within the National Park Service, was working on a two-week rotation when Hughes was killed, he said.
“The team at Sequoia and Kings National Parks is devastated by this terrible news,” parks Supt. Woody Smeck said in a statement. “Our deepest condolences go out to the firefighter’s family and loved ones. We grieve this loss with you.”
The Ferguson fire has left seven others injured. Parts of Yosemite National Park, including Yosemite Valley, remain closed while thousands of structures are threatened.
In Mendocino County, two other wind-driven wildfires had grown to more than 30,000 acres by Sunday evening, forcing thousands of residents to evacuate. The Ranch and River fires, known together as the Mendocino complex fires, began Friday afternoon and exploded over the weekend, destroying six homes as residents in Mendocino County and some neighboring Lake County communities were told to flee, Cal Fire officials said.
Authorities said 10,200 structures were threatened. By Sunday evening, the Mendocino complex fires were 10% contained.

Brian Hughes, captain of the Arrowhead Interagency Hotshots, was killed when he was struck by a tree while working with his crew to set a back fire — a tactic designed to limit a fire’s spread — on the east side of the fire, according to the National Park Service. He was treated at the scene, but died before he could be taken to a hospital. He was 33.
For the record:
10:55 a.m. July 30, 2018An earlier version of this article stated that Yosemite National Park was closed due to the fire. Only parts of the park, including Yosemite Valley, are closed.
“The team at Sequoia and Kings National Parks is devastated by this terrible news,” parks Supt. Woody Smeck said in a statement. “Our deepest condolences go out to the firefighter’s family and loved ones. We grieve this loss with you.”
Hughes, who was originally from Hilo, Hawaii, had worked with the Arrowhead hotshots for four years. They are an elite crew of 20 firefighters based at Sequoia and Kings Canyon National Parks.
“They go into the steepest of the steep, the most rugged of the rugged areas,” said Mike Theune, a spokesman with the parks. The Arrowhead team, one of two hotshot crews within the National Park Service, was working on a two-week rotation when the fatality occurred, he said.
Hillsides in the area are filled with trees that have been killed by five years of drought and a bark beetle infestation, according to state maps. The ground is carpeted with bone-dry pine needles, which are highly combustible. These conditions, combined with dry, hot weather, pose a huge risk to firefighters.
“The biggest overall risk is that these dead trees have an increased risk of falling — themselves and their limbs falling on firefighters,” Heather Williams, a California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection spokeswoman, told the Los Angeles Times several days after the Ferguson fire broke out.
The fire started July 13 and claimed a Cal Fire bulldozer operator’s life when a bulldozer tumbled down a hillside during the building of a defensive line. The blaze has left seven others injured as it has devoured more than 53,000 acres. Parts of Yosemite National Park, including Yosemite Valley, remain closed while thousands of structures are under threat.
More than 3,850 firefighters on the front lines have achieved 30% containment.

"Death toll in wildfire near Redding climbs to six as firefighters struggle to slow 89,000-acre blaze",https://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-redding-fire-mainbar-20180729-story.html,2018-07-30,"More than a dozen people reported missing, 500 structures destroyed.
Reporting from Redding, Calif. —The body of another victim of a massive wildfire burning in Shasta County was recovered Sunday, bringing the total number of fatalities to six, including two firefighters, authorities said.
The identity of the victim or any other details about how the person died were not immediately available, officials said during an afternoon news conference in Redding. The discovery came one day after a family member confirmed the deaths of a 70-year-old woman and her two great-grandchildren.
Authorities said half a dozen other people are still reported missing.
With the unyielding temperatures over 100 degrees and bone-dry vegetation, authorities said there was no end in sight to the Carr fire. Between Friday night and Saturday morning, the fire doubled in size to more than 80,000 acres, the largest of 17 fires burning across the state.
As of Sunday, the blaze had burned more than 89,000 acres and is now burning in a northwest direction away from homes. The fire is only 5% contained but authorities said Sunday they are optimistic that figure will rise by nightfall.
Erratic winds and hot, dry conditions continue to hamper firefighting efforts. A red flag warning and heat advisory will remain in effect through Monday.
Tom Dang, a meteorologist in the National Weather Service’s Sacramento office, said that over the next few days humidity levels will fall to around 10% or 15%, and wind gusts of up to 20 mph are still expected in the afternoons and evenings.
The lone source of minor relief is the temperature, which is expected to reach an afternoon and evening high of about 100 degrees, Dang said.
“This fire has burned so intensely, an incredible amount of smoke has been put into the air, and that’s helping to hold down temperatures a little bit,” he said. “If it weren’t for the smoke, we would be expecting temperatures upwards of 105 to 110.”
Daniel Potter, a spokesman with the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection, said firefighters Sunday were focusing on protecting structures on the eastern and southeastern edge of the fire, which still poses some threat to the communities of Redding and Shasta Lake. He said hand crews — aided by bulldozers — were working furiously to establish more fire lines before winds start picking up from the east later in the afternoon.
The winds so far have not been as bad as in previous days, he said, noting that such breaks in the weather help.
“If there’s limited winds it gives us the chance to get on the fire’s edge and try to stop it,” Potter said.
Hand crews have been doing most of the firefighting because heavy smoke has made visibility a challenge for aircraft, he said.
The blaze in Shasta County was one of 17 major wildfires burning across California on Sunday, consuming a combined 200,000 acres, said Jonathan Cox, battalion chief and information officer with Cal Fire.
“We’ve had 17 fires before,” Cox said. “But these are impacting communities — and they’re large fires, not small.”
With so many fires burning near populated areas, “resources are obviously stretched thin,” he said.
By Sunday afternoon, about 12,000 firefighters from within the state had responded. Another 800 personnel — soldiers and helicopter crews — had been deployed by the California National Guard. And 150 fire engines were on the way from other parts of the country, Cox said.
“There’s a finite number of [firefighting] resources in California, and obviously we’re employing them at the highest-priority incidents where the threat to lives and structures is the highest,” Cox said.
On Twitter, officials with the state’s Office of Emergency Services said California will be receiving help from crews from at least a dozen other states, including Florida and New Jersey.
The deaths of Melody Bledsoe, 70, and her great-grandchildren, Emily Roberts, 5, and James Roberts, 4, were announced Saturday by family members. The three were killed when their Redding home burned Thursday night.
Bledsoe’s granddaughter Amanda Woodley confirmed the news about their deaths Saturday in a public Facebook post written just after she left the Shasta County Sheriff’s Office. Woodley said Bledsoe did everything she could to save the children.
“She was hovered over them both with a wet blanket,” she wrote.
“My heart is crushed,” she said. “I can’t believe this is real. I just keep seeing all of their beautiful faces.”

Shasta County Sheriff Tom Bosenko said no bodies had been found yet, but his investigators are “overwhelmingly sure that there are decedents at the scene.” He said access to the home has been difficult as the walls collapsed during the fire.
The fire, started Monday by a vehicle mechanical failure on California 299, previously claimed the lives of Redding fire inspector Jeremy Stoke and bulldozer operator Don Ray Smith.
In addition to the human cost, at least 500 homes and other structures have succumbed to flames, authorities said.
Sam White’s home of 30 years was destroyed in the fire. But seeing the fire’s destruction put his loss into perspective.
“Everything we had there was nice, but it was stuff,” White, 74, said from Shasta Lake, where he is sheltering with family. “We have our lives. That’s all that counts.”
Early Thursday morning, 16-year-old Hannalora Lewis of Redding was awakened by her mother. Authorities had ordered them to evacuate. The teenager grabbed an outfit, the new pair of sneakers she bought while back-to-school shopping, her camera and her phone.
As she bent down to grab her favorite blanket, her eyes swept over a box filled with mementos — ticket stubs from her favorite movies, rusty nails from the old railroad track she visited in Santa Cruz, rocks, trinkets and her old diaries. For a split second, she contemplated taking it, but she thought it would occupy too much room in the car. Her parents wrangled the dogs, grabbed photos and computers, and almost left her brother’s diabetes medicine.
She raced past the Honda Civic that her father had given her three days before and hopped in her mom’s van with her twin brother and sister. Tears started streaming down her brother’s face.
“I told him to stop because I thought he was being ridiculous,” she said. “I thought it would be a one-day thing.”

Hannalora’s mom tried to reassure her brother, telling him that they were just going to visit their grandparents for a day and that the evacuation was a safety precaution.
The next day, a neighbor sent a picture of their house, leveled by the fire.
The walls of the two-story yellow house were crumpled as if a giant had stepped on them. The house’s charred remains lay exposed. In the cul-de-sac was the shell of a Mercedes-Benz Sprinter van that Hannalora’s dad built bunk beds inside, where they slept when they went camping.
“I didn’t think for a second that we would lose our home,” Hannalora said.
But in this tragedy, Hannalora said, she found community. She has leaned on friends who have also lost their homes. Everybody affected by the fires, she said, is trying to find some silver lining.
The fire consumed her brother’s Xbox, on which he spent hours playing video games. The family joked that that was OK — now he can spend more time with them.
Her parents said they plan to rebuild, and Hannalora, who aspires to be an architect, will get to help.
“We just list off the positives,” she said. “That’s all we have, is the silver lining right now.”

New evacuations in Lakeport as fast-moving fires in Mendocino County threaten hundreds of homes,https://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-ln-mendocino-fire-20180729-story.html,2018-07-29,"Two wind-driven wildfires in Mendocino County have grown to more than 24,000 acres, forcing hundreds of residents to evacuate, authorities said Sunday.
The Ranch and River fires, known together as the Mendocino complex fire, began Friday afternoon and has exploded in the last 24 hours, devouring thousands of acres, destroying four homes and threatening thousands more, according to Cal Fire. The fire is only 5% contained.

Multiple fires across California stretch resources thin; Redding seeks more firefighters,https://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-fire-resources-20180729-story.html,2018-07-29,"Reporting from REDDING, CALIF. —The fire that has devastated Shasta County has killed five people and destroyed more than 500 structures.
But it is one of numerous major fires burning in California, including the massive fire near Yosemite and two big fires to the south in Lake and Mendocino counties.
This has stretched resources, officials said.
Ricky Young, incident commander for the National Park Service, said Saturday night that several wildfires in the state have made it difficult to throw additional resources in battling the Carr fire.
As a result, the state, under a federal bill, requested assistance from other agencies outside of California.
He said about 150 engines are en route to help battle the fires.
There are roughly a dozen fires burning in California.
Aside from the Carr fire, which burned 89,000 acres as of Sunday morning, among the most serious are:
The Cranston firein the San Jacinto Mountains that burned 13,000 acres and several homes.
The Ferguson firenear Yosemite National Park that closed the park and burned 53,000 acres.
The River firein Mendocino County that has burned 13,000 acres and four homes.
The Ranch fire,also in Mendocino County, that has burned 11,000 acres.
The Steele firein Napa County, which burned 150 acres and seven structures.
The Natches fireon the California-Oregon border, which has burned 4,600 acres.
The biggest concern remains the Carr fire, which was burning out of control, threatening thousands more homes and forcing thousands to evacuate.
Unified Incident Commander Chief Brett Gouvea said Saturday the fire has grown on multiple fronts. He said in five days the Carr fire has burned through the footprint of at least five major wildfires in the last 50 years of Shasta County history.
“I’ve never seen anything like that happen,” Gouvea said.
Fire officials are expecting winds to pick up at 1 p.m. Sunday but hope to take advantage of somewhat cooler and calmer conditions until then.
While this year’s fire season has already devastated California, it seems unlikely to relent, said climatologist Bill Patzert. Several cities set all-time heat records this year — in July — but the most serious heat waves, Patzert said, typically don’t arrive until September.
“The dog days are not here yet,” he said. “We’re in for a long, hot summer.”
And that heat creates a dangerous situation, said UCLA climate scientist Daniel Swain. Vegetation across much of the Golden State has already dehydrated to “explosively dry” levels not typically reached until September, he said.
“It’s a lot easier to get bad fires under these conditions,” he said, “because you don’t need as much of a push from the winds.”

California’s deadliest fire is 100% contained; focus shifts to larger blaze in Mendocino County,https://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-ln-california-fire-containment-20180831-story.html,2018-09-01,"California’s deadliest fire in 2018 has been 100% contained, and its largest is not far behind, according to state fire officials.
The Carr fire was sparked by a malfunctioning recreational trailer off Highway 299 in Shasta County on July 23 and scorched 229,651 acres, destroyed 1,079 homes and killed eight people, the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection said. The fire was 100% contained Thursday night.
“Although full containment has been achieved, firefighters will continue to patrol the fire area for several days and fire suppression repair remains ongoing,” Cal Fire said in a statement.
At one point, more than 4,700 firefighters from the U.S. and abroad battled the blaze as it pushed west into Redding, north toward Shasta Lake and east toward Lewiston, officials said. The fire fed on drought-stricken trees, bone-dry grass and was fueled by triple-digit summer heat.
It is the sixth-largest fire in modern state history, according to Cal fire. This year it is also the deadliest so far.
After moving predictably in its first days, the Carr fireexploded on July 26as it moved into Redding.
That day thefire killed four residents, a bulldozer operator and a Redding firefighter who was trying to help peopleflee the flames. In the days after, a Pacific Gas & Electric worker helping to restore power in the area died in an accident, followed by a second firefighter who died in a car crash.
Meanwhile, crews on Friday were wrapping up efforts to contain theMendocino Complex fire, a pair of wildfires that broke out near each other in the Mendocino National Forest on July 27.
Treated as a single incident, the fire was 96% contained Friday and had scorched 459,102 acres,dwarfing all other firesin modern state history. For comparison’s sake, the second-largest fire in recorded state history, the Thomas fire that burned in Southern California last year, was 281,893 acres.
The Mendocino Complex fires have destroyed 157 homes and killed one firefighter. Full containment is expected Saturday, according to Cal Fire.

"Editorial: If we intend to clear the homeless from fire danger zones, then we need to have housing for them",https://www.latimes.com/opinion/editorials/la-ed-homeless-fire-danger-20180831-story.html,2018-08-31,"Last December, a wildfire tore up a hillside east of the 405 Freeway in the Sepulveda Pass, destroying six homes, damaging a dozen others in the Bel-Air neighborhood and burning more than 400 acres. The Skirball fire, as it was dubbed, was sparked by a cooking fire at a homeless encampment embedded in a canyon off Sepulveda Boulevard. When authorities found it, all that remained was the charred detritus of campsite cookware and a portable stove. The residents are believed to have survived the fire and moved on. Now the Leo Baeck Temple, located not far from the former encampment, has filed a lawsuit against the city and county of Los Angeles (as well as the state) for damage to their buildings and grounds — estimated to be in the millions of dollars, according to one of the temple’s lawyers. The lawsuit contends that authorities knew about the encampment with its open-air fires and were negligent in allowing it to stay on public property.
It wasn’t a surprise then, or now, that homeless people are resourceful enough to bivouac in steep, brushy hillsides to hide away from street and pedestrian traffic and the hostile passersby they encounter when they camp on sidewalks. But precisely because they are so well-hidden, these enclaves are difficult to find. Not that outreach workers don’t try — often following up on tips they get from members of the public who see homeless people in a brushy area. The encampment near Bel-Air had been visited by outreach workers at some point in the year, but obviously the camp stayed in place.
The danger of fire has never been more constant in this area, so it’s vital that we not allow homeless encampments to be a source of ignition.
In the wake of the Skirball fire, L.A. City Council member Paul Koretz — whose district includes the fire area — prodded the Fire Department to lay out steps to make sure this didn’t happen again. And Mayor Eric Garcetti set up a task force of fire and police officials and the Los Angeles Homeless Services Authority to survey high fire danger areas across the city. Going forward, the city decided, when homeless encampments were found burrowed into canyons and hillsides, notices would be put up (on trees, fencing or stakes in the ground) that they were a danger to all and needed to be abandoned. Outreach workers would try to persuade homeless people to leave — for shelter or just somewhere else less risky — and would urge them not to use grills, generators, and the like. Finally, police and Bureau of Sanitation workers would be dispatched to dismantle the camps. People would be taken to shelters if they chose.
According to the mayor’s office, the survey completed in January identified 191 encampments on 58 different sites and all were cleared. But that doesn’t mean homeless people have stopped camping in brush and woods around the city. The city task force is expected to restart its survey and search for encampments again next month.
That’s a smart move. The danger of fire has never been more constant in this area, so it’s vital that we not allow homeless encampments to be a source of ignition. It’s dangerous for homeless people as well as for nearby neighborhoods. Clearing homeless camps in a brushy area is no different from clearing camps in riverbeds before and during rainstorms. It’s a matter of safety.
And that should be the main reason to dismantle a homeless encampment. This shouldn’t be seen as a pretext to roust homeless people from their tents at night on random sidewalks well outside the fire zone where, by court settlement, they are allowed to sleep.
Enter the Fray: First takes on the news of the minute from L.A. Times Opinion »
But here is the most important thing for communities and city officials to remember: If there is an urgent need to move homeless people out of encampments in high fire danger areas, then there is an equally urgent need to set up more shelter and housing for them. Otherwise, they have literally nowhere to go and will simply camp elsewhere. The Skirball fire shows that it’s time for City Council members to firmly commit to constructing bridge shelters and permanent housing in their districts and it’s time for neighborhoods to accept that housing and stop fighting it. In fact, it’s past time.
Across the city, neighborhoods have fought shelters, housing, storage facilities, and safe-parking programs for homeless people. Koretz has directed the city to examine several possible sites for shelter and housing, and he’s in talks with a Jewish cultural center in Westwood about using part of its facility as bridge housing for homeless college students. Good — but he and many of his colleagues on the council need to stop looking and start finding places to build shelters. Fires, by the way, don’t care about the politics in the neighborhoods they burn.

Newsletter: Essential California: Wildfires make it harder to get insurance,https://www.latimes.com/newsletters/la-me-ln-essential-california-20180831-story.html,2018-08-31,"Good morning, and welcome to the Essential Californianewsletter. It’sFriday, Aug. 31,and here’s what’s happening across California:
TOP STORIES
As California’s wildfires grow larger and more intense,an increasing number of insurance companies are not renewing policies for customers who live in areas they deem too risky to cover. The state estimates that more than 1 million California homes are considered at high risk for wildfires, and officials expect a significant increase in dropped policies after California’s destructive fire season this year. In fire danger zones, homeowners’ complaints of getting dropped by their plans more than tripled between 2010 to 2016. The situation has whole towns scrambling to stay insured.Los Angeles Times

Net neutrality bill advances
California lawmakers advanced an ambitious proposal Thursday to prevent broadband providers from hindering or manipulating access to the internet,bringing the state closer to enacting the strongest net neutrality protections in the country. The proposal prevents internet service providers from blocking or slowing down websites and video streams, or charging websites fees for faster speeds. But it also goes further than the old regulations and measures taken up by other states, placing new limits on certain data plans, and tasking the state’s attorney general with investigating cases in which companies might be evading the rules.Los Angeles Times
A question of intent
California lawmakers have sent a proposal to the governor thatwould widely limit who can be charged under the felony murder rule, which allows defendants to be convicted of first-degree murder if a victim dies during the commission of a felony, even if the defendant did not intend to kill or did not know a homicide occurred.Los Angeles Times
WARNING!
A warning sign known to the state of California to cause anything from angst to “meh” has just become bolder and more specific. As of Friday, consumers have to be told which of the 900 or so compounds “known to the state of California” to cause cancer, birth defects or other reproductive harm are in what they buy, touch, breathe or drink in the course of their day.Los Angeles Times

AND FINALLY
Today’s California memory comes fromKaren Hall:
“I grew up in Coos Bay, Ore.; my maternal grandparents raised my sister and me. In the late 1950s, they told us that we were going to take a trip to California just so we could say that we had been there. We were so excited; I had read movie magazines, I’d heard about Disneyland and saw California as a state of bright lights, big cities and movie stars. We left early in the morning driving down Highway 101, which took us along the Pacific Ocean and through the small towns on the Oregon coast; we stopped for lunch along the way and then continued on. It seemed like such a long drive, were we never going to get there? Finally, we both fell asleep. We were awakened by my grandmother a short time later, telling us that we were in California. I raised up and looked out the window, such disappointment. There were just more trees, no big city, no bright lights or movie stars. They took us to the Trees of Mystery the next day as well as a small aquarium in Crescent City, then we returned home.
“Many years later, after I married, my husband joined the Navy; our first duty station was in Alameda; our next duty station was San Diego. He retired from the Navy at Mare Island and we finished raising our family here. California offers a little of everything: In a couple of hours, we can be at the ocean or in the mountains. We’ve been here permanently now since 1982 and I’m proud to call it home.”

"As California fire disasters worsen, insurers are pulling out and stranding homeowners",https://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-ln-wildfire-homeowners-insurance-20180830-story.html,2018-08-31,"Sheri Madrzyk and her husband got the letter from their insurer two years ago: Because they live in an area at high risk for wildfires, the company would no longer insure their home.
The couple live in Lake County in Northern California, where more than 50% of the land has been burned by fires in the last several years. They were forced to scramble, eventually securing coverage through Lloyd’s of London — the insurer of the uninsurable — with a $2,100 premium. It was costlier than their last plan, but still within their budget. Then, in early 2018, they got another notice: Their rate had ballooned to $5,800.
As California wildfires grow larger and more intense, an increasing number of insurance companies are not renewing policies for customers who live in areas they deem too risky to cover. The state estimates that more than 1 million California homes are considered at high risk for wildfires.
A California Department of Insurance report found that the number of homeowners in the wildland-urban interface who complained about getting dropped by their plans more than tripled from 2010 to 2016. Complaints about increased premiums rose 217%.
Those statistics provide a limited view of the problem, as the state has no way of tracking policy nonrenewals and individual premium hikes. But they reflect the cusp of a trend that is expected to worsen, state Insurance Commissioner Dave Jones said.
“There’s no question of that,” he said, “given the severity of the 2015, 2017 and 2018 fires.”
California has faced historic fire losses since October, with more than 10,000 homes destroyed and more than 50 people killed. Experts expect the toll will make insurers look even more closely at their level of risk in the state.
Lake County residents were among the first to confront the insurance issue after the Valley fire in October 2015, which destroyed nearly 2,000 buildings in Lake, Sonoma and Napa counties and at the time ranked as the fifth-worst wildfire insurance disaster in California’s history.
Increasingly, residents living in or near forested areas are facing rate hikes so significant that they’re taking circuitous routes to find cheaper and less comprehensive coverage.
Such was the case for the Madrzyks, who balked at Lloyd’s new rate and opted for a less pricey plan with a higher deductible — and $200,000 less in personal property coverage. It is also through a non-admitted insurer, meaning it is not regulated by the state. It’s “a sacrifice, I guess,” Sheri Madrzyk said, to live in their quiet town so close to nature.
The California Department of Insurance acknowledges that this trend is a rational response on the part of insurers, who in 2017 received nearly $12 billion in claims from wildfires that destroyed more than 32,000 homes in the state. It makes sense that companies will write fewer — if any — policies in areas where they predict losses will outweigh what they can recoup through premiums.
Still, the agency contends, legislators must take action to protect consumers — especially those who have made an effort to reduce their wildfire risk — from increased rates and canceled coverage.
For now, those who want to keep living in high-risk areas have options, the last resort being the California FAIR Plan, a state-sponsored program that provides insurance for homeowners left behind by companies in the open market.
But those tracking the issue note that not everyone can afford FAIR Plan premiums. And if wildfires intensify and become more frequent, as predicted, the admitted insurance market may keep shrinking, causing residents to either forgo wildfire coverage or abandon their communities altogether.
Lake County Supervisor Jim Steele said he became a “lightning rod for insurance complaints” in late 2015. At first, they were from constituents who had lost their homes and couldn’t get insurance companies to cover them so that they could rebuild. Within a few months, he started hearing from residents who were dropped by companies once their policies came up for renewal. And then, suddenly, he was one of them.
Steele was paying an $1,800 insurance premium through Farmers when his policy was nonrenewed. After being denied by several other admitted insurers, he turned to the FAIR plan. But his premium doubled, and the coverage was minimal. He had to buy an additional plan, known as a surplus line, for his house’s contents, outbuildings and machinery.
Like Steele, a growing number of Californians are turning to the FAIR plan after being dropped by private insurance companies. In the last four years, the number of residents covered by FAIR policies in the wildland-urban interface has grown by 35%, or about 8,000 homeowners, according to FAIR Plan Assn. data.
Steele learned from insurance representatives that smaller companies are more willing to cover homes in fire-prone areas. That’s because rather than assessing the overall risk of larger swaths of land, they are more likely to evaluate individual properties, taking into consideration efforts homeowners have made to reduce risk, such as clearing brush and trimming trees. But these smaller companies are mostly non-admitted, leaving customers more vulnerable to excessive rate hikes.
Steele was toying with the idea of using a non-admitted insurer when he learned about Yapacopia, a public benefit corporation that connects people who’ve been non-renewed with independent insurance agents.
Steele was able to find a plan through an admitted insurer — the safer option — at a relatively reasonable rate this way. Now when the supervisor gets calls from constituents who’ve been slapped with premium hikes or nonrenewal notices, he refers them to Yapacopia.
As residents of places like Lake County learn to navigate the evolving insurance landscape, state regulators insist that more must be done to protect consumers from rate hikes and nonrenewals.
In a January report, the California Department of Insurance proposed a measure that would prevent admitted carriers from dropping homeowners who take measures to reduce wildfire risk. The agency also suggested implementing a partnership between insurers and communities — similar to one in Boulder, Colo., that’s funded by the state and the Federal Emergency Management Agency — that would allow homeowners who complete certain risk-mitigation efforts to obtain coverage from participating insurers.
The agency would also like the power to regulate the computer models used to assess property risk. According to the Department of Insurance, most models base fire-risk scores on satellite images that capture the type and distribution of vegetation on the property, the slope of the land, ease of access for firefighters and proximity to the nearest higher-risk area. But by and large, these models do not consider efforts taken by homeowners and communities to reduce risk, such as clearing brush and fortifying homes with fire-resistant materials.
These proposals and several others made by Jones have gained little traction in the Legislature. The insurance commissioner chalks this up to lobbying efforts on the part of the insurance industry. Since 2011, insurers have spent more than $5 million supporting or opposing legislative candidates, committees or ballot measures, and more than $11 million to influence specific bills in front of the Legislature, records show.
Industry representatives say companies have good reason for not factoring individual mitigation efforts into risk models.
“If I clear my brush around my house and my neighbors don’t, and a fire breaks out, insurers still pay for that loss,” said Mark Sektnan, vice president of the Property Casualty Insurers Assn. of America, which represents more than 30 homeowners insurance companies. And the cost of boosting satellite resolution to zoom in at the property level would likely be passed onto consumers, according to a letter written by industry representatives in response to the state’s regulatory proposals.
Insurers contend that before they can begin considering such changes, their premium rates must reflect the actual cost of insuring high-risk areas — and they don’t right now, Sektnan said.
“A healthy insurance market is one where insurers are allowed to charge rates that are relative to risk,” said Lloyd Dixon, director of the Rand Center for Catastrophic Risk Management and Compensation, which recently released a report on homeowners insurance as part of an annual climate-change assessment for the California Natural Resources Agency.
Even in the long term, it is unlikely that admitted insurers will pull out of the wildland-urban interface entirely, according to researchers who study the industry. Instead, insurance companies may offer policies that do not cover wildfire damage, said Carolyn Kousky, director of policy research at the Wharton Risk Management and Decision Processes Center.
This could trigger dire consequences for fire-prone communities.
“If a big fire comes, people won’t have the money to rebuild,” Kousky said. In turn, municipalities could lose residents, stressing local economies that depend on property taxes for K-12 education, road maintenance and public safety.
In the short term, some of California’s most picturesque communities could become even more exclusive, Kousky said, with real estate markets catering to those who can afford the steep insurance premiums.
Ultimately, California residents need to pay attention to what the homeowners insurance market is telling them, said Alice Hill, a research fellow at the Hoover Institution.
“The insurance industry is a signal of risk. The fact that the insurance companies are pulling back is a signal that the risk is too great,” said Hill, who served as senior director for resilience under President Obama. “And that, for all of us, should cause us to think how can we better protect against this risk.”
That means thinking twice before building in the wildland-urban interface, Kousky said. But in a booming housing market where it is difficult for local governments to curtail development tax revenue, it could also mean constructing homes with fire-resistant materials and providing incentives for residents to clear brush on and around their property.
Then there is the solution that no one likes to talk about, Kousky said — moving out.
The idea crossed Sheri Madrzyk’s mind, but only briefly, after the brutal Lake County wildfires in 2015 and 2017. It would be hard to sell a house with such a high insurance premium, the Kelseyville resident said. And her family loves this bucolic hamlet, with its rolling green hills and country roads and locally owned vineyards.
So instead of buying a new car this year, the Madrzyks invested in an excavator to remove brush around their home.
“We have to protect it,” Madrzyk said of her community, “and whatever we can do to protect it, we will.”

California legislators advance bill to set strongest net neutrality protections in U.S.,https://www.latimes.com/politics/la-pol-ca-net-neutrality-assembly-vote-20180830-story.html,2018-08-31,"Reporting from Sacramento —California lawmakers advanced an ambitious proposal Thursday to prevent broadband providers from hindering or manipulating access to the internet, bringing the state closer to enacting the strongest net neutrality protections in the country.
The legislation by Sen. Scott Wiener (D-San Francisco) would bring back Obama-era internet rules rolled back by federal regulators this year, the latest volley cast by state leaders already feuding with the Trump administration over immigration and climate protection policies.
The proposal prevents internet service providers from blocking or slowing down websites and video streams or charging websites fees for faster speeds. But it also goes further than the old regulations and measures taken up by other states, placing new limits on certain data plans and tasking the state’s attorney general with investigating cases in which companies might be evading the rules.
On the Assembly floor, Republicans argued that the state was going too far and would help create a nationwide patchwork of state laws by treading into an area that should be reserved for the federal government.
Assemblyman Jim Patterson (R-Fresno), a former broadcaster who owned radio stations in California and Idaho, argued that “light-touch regulation” helped the internet flourish. The broad new rules, he contended, would burden companies and prevent innovation.
“The overreach, the going too far here is going to be challenged in court constitutionally, and we are going to find ourselves in very uncertain territory,” he said.
Accusing the bill’s proponents of being unable to explain net neutrality, Assemblywoman Melissa Melendez (R-Lake Elsinore) called the Democrats’ resistance to the Trump administration “embarrassing.”
“You are wading into an area that you have no business being in,” she said.
But supporters argued that California needed to take a stand at a time when officials appointed by President Trump had rolled back many consumer protections and broadband providers were willing to profit at the expense of customers and public safety.
“We are stepping up and filling the role that we need to fill because we cannot rely on this federal government to protect us when we need protection,” Assemblyman Ian Calderon (D-Whittier) said.
Senate Bill 822cleared the Assembly with overwhelming and bipartisan support on a 61-18 vote, overcoming the first major hurdle after months ofaggressive lobbying and online advocacy campaignswaged between internet advocates and the telecom industry that have drawn national attention.
The legislation moves to the state Senate, where it was pending Thursday, and lawmakers said it has a good chance to be passed.
“Today’s vote is a huge win for Californians everywhere,” Wiener said in a statement. “The internet is at the heart of 21st century life — our economy, our public safety and health systems, our democracy — and we must protect it.
Net neutrality proponents celebrated the bill’s approval in the Assembly as a victory for internet users and small businesses, calling the protections essential to democracy and fair competition.
“No one wants their cable or phone company to control what they see and do on the internet,” said Evan Greer, deputy director of the tech advocacy group Fight for the Future.
But telecom industry groups, including the California Cable and Telecommunications Assn. and the Cellular Telecommunications Industry Assn., pledged to keep fighting the legislation.
The Assembly’s “vote today keeps the country strapped into a roller-coaster ride of state net neutrality regulations, but won’t get us any closer to the stable and consistent net neutrality protections consumers deserve in the long term,” said Jonathan Spalter, president and chief executive of USTelecom, a Washington-based lobby group.
California is one of 29 states to consider net neutrality protections since the Federal Communications Commission voted late last year to reverse the Obama-era internet regulations, with FCC Chairman Ajit Pai and Republicans calling for an end to the utility-like oversight of internet service providers.
The rules, enacted in February 2015 and ended in June, barred broadband and wireless companies such as AT&T Inc. and Verizon from selling faster delivery of some data, slowing speeds for certain content or favoring selected websites over others.
Wiener’s Senate Bill 822 would, in effect, reestablish the same regulations. It also restricts some zero-rated data plans, or package deals that allow companies such as Verizon or Comcast to exempt some calls, texts or other content from counting against a customer’s data plan.
An additional proposal, Senate Bill 460, by Sen. Kevin de León (D-Los Angeles) would deny public contracts to companies that fail to follow the new state internet rules. It also is expected to be taken up by the Assembly this week, though a dispute is brewing over amendments that could allow a state agency to waive the net neutrality rules in certain cases.
We’re now dealing with a straight-up misinformation campaign on our#NetNeutralitybill,#SB822: industry robo-calls to seniors falsely telling them that protecting net neutrality will increase their phone bills by $30. Scaring seniors w lies about their financial security? Grosspic.twitter.com/1Lgop6KwSl
Debate over the proposals comes as net neutrality has emerged as a rallying issue for Democrats in House races across the country.
Clashes between net neutrality proponents and telecom industry lobbyistsheated up again last weekwhen Verizon was reported to have slowed the speed of the Santa Clara County Fire Department’s wireless data transmission, a revelation detailed in an addendum to a federal lawsuit filed by states including California to challenge the repeal of net neutrality rules.
Verizon has said the incident was due to a customer service error and has nothing to do with net neutrality.
But on the Assembly floor Thursday, Assemblyman Ash Kalra (D-San Jose) said passing the bill was also about making sure that public safety officers have open access to the internet.
“So they don’t find themselves in the situation that our county firefighters found themselves in during the biggest wildfire in the state’s history,” he said.
Over the weekend, Wiener accused broadband companies of using robocalls to mislead the elderly about the impact of his bill, and he posted a voicemail of one such alleged call on Twitter.
Assemblyman Miguel Santiago (D-Los Angeles), who presented the bill Thursday, was the target of a different campaign in June, one waged by net neutrality proponents who condemned his Assembly committee’s earlier attempt to throw out contents of Wiener’s bill.
He since helped restore the bill and signed on as a co-author to both net neutrality proposals.
“We all know why we are here,” Santiago said. “The Trump administration destroyed the internet as we know it.”

California wildfires fuel a new push to ban smoking at state parks and beaches,https://www.latimes.com/politics/la-pol-ca-smoking-ban-beaches-20180830-story.html,2018-08-30,"Reporting from Sacramento —After more than a decade of attempts to ban smoking at California beaches and parks, environmentalists have advanced new legislation to prevent lighting up in certain public places.
The proposals, approved Thursday by the Senate, now go to Gov. Jerry Brown, whovetoed three previous billson the issue.
Supporters feel this year’s devastating wildfires have bolstered their argument and given their proposals new urgency.
Assemblyman Marc Levine (D-San Rafael) emphasized the fire-related need for the legislation during floor debate in the Assembly.
“The 2017 California wildfire season was the most destructive one on record, and the 2018 season is not off to a great start,” Levine said. “This bill is a common-sense approach to lower the risk of forest fires and will help curb pollution.”
Levine noted many of the wildfires that Cal Fire responds to are “started by carelessly discarded cigarettes.”
Cal Fire responded to an average of 47 wildfires each year caused by smoking during the five-year period ending in 2017, the agency reported.
Environmentalists and health groups have pushed for expanded smoking rules for years, arguing that second-hand smoke presents a cancer risk, while cigarette butts littering beaches and park trails are toxic to wildlife and spoil the state’s natural beauty.
Sen. Steve Glazer (D-Concord) made that point to colleagues after authoring two smoking-ban bills this year: one for beaches and one for parks.
“California is home to some of the nation’s most scenic beaches and parklands,” he said. “It’s imperative that we protect our precious natural resources and ensure that we provide the people of California a clean and smoke-free space.”
But similar appeals have not persuaded others in the past, including the governor.
“If people can’t smoke even on a deserted beach, where can they?” Brown asked in his veto message last year. “There must be some limit to the coercive power of government.”
Lawmakers who failed in prior attempts at a ban have pared back this year’s legislation.
One of Glazer’s bills sent to the governor bans smoking — including marijuana and electronic cigarettes — in state parks, but allows officials to exempt certain areas from the ban. The other bill would apply the same restrictions to beaches, but only where the state has posted signs warning that smoking is banned.
“I’m hoping that Gov. Brown will see that we refashioned the legislation to give him flexibility on where a smoking ban could be acceptable, especially with increasing fire risks,” Glazer said.
Levine also introduced a bill, which was approved Friday. His measure would apply only to designated picnic areas at state parks and beaches. Narrowing the bill to where families congregate and eat makes sense, Levine said, noting that California banned smoking in restaurants long ago.
“Think of picnic areas as outdoor restaurants,” he said.
Levine’s bill that was vetoed last year proposed a fine of $50, while Glazer’s last effort would have fined offenders $100. Brown objected to the proposals, noting that the cost of breaking the law could reach $485 with court fees included, which he said was excessive.
This year, both Glazer and Levine are proposing $25 fines.
Bills to ban outdoor smoking have been introduced since 2004, when legislation to prevent people from lighting up on beaches failed to make it out of the Senate.
A 2010 bill by then-Sen. Jenny Oropeza (D-Long Beach) was vetoed by then-Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger, the cigar-loving Republican who called the bill “an improper intrusion of government into people’s lives.”
The theme was taken up by others in the GOP during floor debates this year.
Assemblyman Matthew Harper (R-Huntington Beach) read Brown’s 2017 veto message on the Assembly floor and said he agreed with the Democrat.
“We should not restrict the freedoms that some Californians can still enjoy,” Harper said, noting it is already against state law to litter state beaches and parks.
Harper also attacked the wildfire argument.
“As we know, beaches themselves are not flammable,” he said.
Levine offered another possible strategy to get the governor on board.
“I would invite Gov. Brown to take a drag on a cigarette on his ranch in Colusa,” Levine said in reference to the rural homestead where the governor plans to live after leaving office in January.

Photo exhibit captures night skies and California terrain aglow with wildfires,https://www.latimes.com/local/la-me-stuart-palley-unfurled-20180830-htmlstory.html,2018-08-30,"Photographer Stuart Palley has spent the last five years covering wildfires across California. An exhibition of his work, “Terra Flamma: Wildfires at Night” opens Saturday at the historic Santora building in Santa Ana. Palley mainly works at night so that the fires themselves become the main light source. He recently agreed to discuss his project:
Q:What is the most difficult aspect of covering wildfires at night?
A:The most challenging aspect of photographing wildfires at night is the often-steep terrain, unfamiliar roads, and shifting winds that occur as the temperature cools in the evenings. Fires usually burn in mountainous and hilly areas and navigating narrow dirt or forest roads is a hazard in itself, as is hiking around in the dark. Although I use a headlamp and have a backup light source, it can be hard to see more than a dozen feet in any direction unless the fire is very close and making it’s own light. I’m basically working in the dark to create photos, and its often a trial and error process to compose frames while hiking or driving around.
Q:What are some of your main safety concerns?
A:My chief safety concerns at wildfires are snags and road hazards. Snags are burned, dead, or weakened trees that have a hazard of falling over completely or have branches that can also fall. Many wildland firefighter fatalities are due to snags falling and it’s no different for anyone on the fire ground, media, command staff, or contractor. Trees ravaged by drought and bark beetle kill break like matchsticks, and once fire moves through they are primed for falling over. A dead tree stump can burn underground for days in the base of the tree and root system, and fall over a week later. Many areas are unsafe to hike in for years after a fire burns through. Additionally the extreme fire behavior of late driven by drought, heavy fuels, and climate change continues to surpass seasoned firefighter expectations and growth modeling, meaning that if you’re in the wrong place at the wrong time, there might not be much you can do to escape. The literal fire tornado with EF3 wind speeds in excess of 140mph at the Carr Fire and ensuing loss of firefighter and civilian lives as a result underscores the risk. So I play things very “safe” so to speak, keeping my distance, relying on experience, and listening and watching closely what the experts, the firefighters themselves do. If they leave, I leave. If they tell me somewhere isn’t safe, I stay away. I’m grateful to have a Firefighter II qualification and fire behavior training and experience.
Q:Do you work alongside firefighters?
A:I have the opportunity to photograph alongside firefighters as part of my call-when-needed contract with the US Forest Service, where I am officially assigned to a wildfire incident as a resource and photograph fire crews working to document the blazes and help the incident command team share updates. I often photograph alongside crews in California, obtaining permission from crew superintendents to shadow crews as they work for various periods of time on the fire line. It is a privilege to photograph the crews and see them working to protect lives, property, and resources through extremely tough conditions, - choking smoke, ash, and extreme heat for days on end with little sleep. Photographing US Forest Service hotshot crews, hand crews, and other agency crews like Cal Fire, Los Angeles County Fire, etc, in the back country allows me to share their story that not many people see. By experiencing the same conditions that they do, I appreciate the sacrifice they make, being away from home for weeks on end, sleeping in the dirt, and eating MREs. This year I’ve seen the fatigue on their faces, from fighting fires back to back with minimal rest days, the loss of friends, time away from family, etc. The wildland fire world is small, and when there is a death it reverberates through the community. I come home exhausted, but with a renewed sense of gratitude, both for having witnessed the large-scale effort that is fighting a wildfire, and for the trust crews have placed in me to share a glimpse of their world.
The Santora building is at 205 N. Broadway in Santa Ana. The exhibit will run through Oct. 2.

"Dry Santa Ana winds bring red flag warning, clearing creepy fog and creating a chilly Halloween night",https://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-ln-wind-20181031-story.html,2018-10-31,"Blustery Santa Ana winds that are expected to blow through the region Wednesday will dry out the area and clear the eerie morning fog that settled over parts of coastal Los Angeles, making way for a chilly Halloween night.
Forecasters predict the winds will die down by late afternoon — just in time for trick-or-treaters to swarm neighborhoods. As darkness falls, temperatures are expected to drop into the mid-50s and low 60s, said David Sweet, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service.
“As the sun goes down, with the dry conditions we have, the temperatures will drop rather quickly,” he said. “Halloween night will be really scary for trick-or-treaters if they’re not wearing a coat.”
Winds were already picking up in the Angeles National Forest and the Valley before sunrise Wednesday, with gusts up to 50 mph in some areas. Creepy fog caused by a shallow marine layer lingering over coastal regions will eventually be blown away, Sweet said.
“The winds haven’t quite made it out to the coast — at least not enough to dislodge that patch of dense fog,” he said.
Coastal Los Angeles is expected to get its share of breezy weather by about 10 a.m.
The National Weather Service has issued a wind advisory warning of northeast winds blowing between 15 and 25 mph, with gusts up to 35 miles per hour from Ventura County to Orange County. The strongest winds will blow through Ventura, Malibu and the Hollywood Hills. The advisory is expected to be in place until 3 p.m.
Temperatures in Los Angeles and Orange counties are expected to hover in the low 80s throughout the day before dipping in the evening. San Diego and Ventura counties can expect slightly cooler temperatures in the mid- to high 70s, forecasters predict.
The weather service also issued a red flag warning through Wednesday, warning that gusty winds, low relative humidity and warm daytime temperatures over the mountains and valleys in Los Angeles and Ventura counties could create conditions favorable for wildfires.
This means if a spark ignites, high winds could allow fires to spread quickly over dry areas, according to the agency.

Southern California Edison says its equipment helped spark massive Thomas fire that killed 2,https://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-ln-thomas-fire-socal-edison-20181030-story.html,2018-10-31,"Southern California Edison on Tuesday said its electrical equipment likely sparked at least one starting point in the massive Thomas fire that ravaged Ventura and Santa Barbara counties late last year.
The utility said in a statement that witnesses reported a fire igniting along Koenigstein Road in Santa Paula near a power pole and that the company “believes that its equipment was associated with this ignition.”
The announcement comes as Edison faces multiple lawsuits in connection with the Thomas fire, marking another devastating blaze attributed to a utility company’s equipment in recent years.
Capt. Stan Ziegler of the Ventura County Fire Department, which is spearheading an investigation by multiple public agencies, said the Thomas fire had at least two starting points: Koenigstein Road and Anlauf Canyon in Ventura County.
An official cause of the blaze has not yet been declared, and the utility’s statement is based solely on the company’s own investigation, Ziegler said.
“We’re not coordinating information,” he said. Fire authorities hope to release the official cause by the end of November, Ziegler said.
The Thomas fire began Dec. 4 and charred 281,893 acres to rank as the second-largest ever recorded in California history, behind the Mendocino Complex inferno that burned in Northern California this summer, according to the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection.
Two deaths were attributed to the blaze: Virginia Pesola, 70, of Santa Paula, was found dead in a car that crashed along an evacuation route in Ventura County, and San Diego fire engineer Cory Iverson, 32, was killed battling the fire on Dec. 14. The fire destroyed 1,063 structures.
Steven Conroy, an Edison spokesman, told The Times that when it was determined that the utility’s equipment likely contributed to the ignition, “we felt it was important for our customers and our communities to hear from us.”
In afiling with the Securities and Exchange Commission, the company said it was expecting to incur losses from lawsuits filed in connection with the blaze but said it was unclear how much.
In aphone call with investorson Tuesday, Pedro Pizarro, president and chief executive of Edison International, said the utility “is continuing to assess the progression of the fire from the Koenigstein Road ignition point and the extent of property and other damage that may be attributable to that ignition.”
He said the company had not determined whether the ignition in the Anlauf Canyon area involved the utility’s equipment. At both locations, Cal Fire has removed Edison equipment, Pizarro said.
“We have not been granted access, which has delayed the completion of our review,” Pizarro said. “Given the uncertainty as to the contributing causes of the Thomas fire, the complexities associated with multiple ignition points and the potential for separate damages to be attributable to fires ignited at separate ignition points, we are currently unable to reasonably estimate a range of losses that may be incurred.”
Joseph Liebman, a Santa Barbara attorney who represents victims of the Thomas fire who have sued Edison, said the company’s statement is “a very significant development and one that will be admissible in court to prove Edison’s liability in causing the Thomas fire.”
Liebman said his law firm and two others represent nearly 500 victims of the fire and the subsequent mudflow on Jan. 9 that devastated Montecito and killed 21 people. The attorney said the fire, which left steep mountains and slopes above Montecito bare of vegetation and unable to absorb heavy rainfall, created the conditions responsible for the mud and debris flow.
The cases, he said, related to property damage, personal injury and wrongful death, and that damages could exceed $1 billion. Liebman said the plaintiffs’ attorneys are confident that the fire’s second starting point also is related to Edison equipment.
“Our clients, when they learn of this, will be very, very pleased,” he said.
Many of California’s most destructive fires have been fueled by powerful winds, which in some cases have caused power lines to snap off and spark blazes. Utility companies are on the hook for hundreds of millions of dollars in losses. Two of the state’s largest electricity providers — Pacific Gas & Electric and San Diego Gas & Electric — both face steep costs related to past wildfires.
In a sweeping effort to reduce the wildfire risk from electric power lines, Edison said in September that itwants to spend $582 millionfor a series of improvements to its grid that likely would mean higher bills for ratepayers.
Edison is asking the state for permission to spend the money on improvements, including strengthening poles and using better technology to determine when winds put the power grid at risk.
Over the next two years, an estimated 600 miles of exposed power lines would be replaced with insulated ones. Officials said ratepayers would see their bills increase between 81 cents and $1.20 a month.

Camp fire evacuation warnings failed to reach more than a third of residents meant to receive calls,https://www.latimes.com/local/california/la-me-ln-paradise-evacuation-warnings-20181130-story.html,2018-12-01,"Emergency phone calls telling Paradise residents to run from the massive Camp fire failed to reach more than a third of even the minority who signed up for the warnings, according to a data review by The Times on Friday.
Many of the town’s residents said they relied on calls from alarmed relatives and the sight of approaching flames to flee from California’s worst fire on Nov. 8. Logs released Friday show the official warning system reached fewer than 6,200 of the 27,000 who live in the ridge-top community.
At least 88 people died in the blaze and more than 100 are still missing.
The data underscore major flaws in a phone-based warning system that authorities have frequently relied upon in major disasters, including a string of catastrophic fires that have plagued California in the last two years.
Call failure reports released by the Butte County Sheriff’s Office at the request of The Times show that the first evacuation orders requested by firefighters at the scene of the massive blaze frequently failed to connect. About as many calls went to voicemail as were answered by a live person.
Even the calls that were answered went to only a fraction in Paradise — an estimated 30% — who subscribed to the phone-based CodeRed system contracted for by Butte County and owned by California-based OnSolve.
The success rate dropped even further as the fire swept over Paradise and took down cellphone towers and panicked residents picked up their phones and jammed capacity in remaining cell lines. Logs show that more than half of some efforts to reach subscribed Paradise residents simply failed to go through.
“There were like seven to nine towers that went down, so that was huge,” said Paradise Police Chief Eric Reinbold.
The outages also forced the city’s police department to abandon its dispatch center. Reinbold said he believed the fire interrupted efforts to send evacuation orders. He did not know that a full evacuation of the entire town was ever ordered.
“It just rolled through,” he said.
Cellphone companies must report to the state major incidents that cut communications, but those reports to the California Public Utilities Commission are confidential, said a commission spokeswoman.
Leigh Bailey, whose Magalia neighborhood was placed under a mandatory evacuation order hours after the blaze began, said she never received an alert that day even though she had signed up for the CodeRed warning system. She first learned about the fire from a neighbor who didn’t think it would threaten the town, so she went back inside to enjoy coffee cake and tea.
By the time the 54-year-old realized she needed to leave, the main evacuation route was jammed with traffic. She had to navigate a dirt canyon road used by firefighters to escape.
“We never got a single notification. Nothing came over our cellphones,” she said.
Troy Harper, general manager of OnSolve’s public sector division, said a number of factors can delay CodeRed alerts from reaching their targets. Though the company’s system — a network of 12 data centers around the world — can theoretically push out a message to hundreds of thousands of phones in one area in a minute, there is no telecommunications infrastructure in the United States set up to handle an influx that large, Harper said.
In Northern California, he said, the system is generally limited to 2,000 to 4,000 calls a minute. As a result, neighbors can receive the same warning minutes or even hours apart. Such delays were found in Paradise, with more than half an hour delay in the receipt of emergency orders to leave.
The system relies on the same cellphone towers and phone lines strung along power poles that residents are using to call 911, neighbors and relatives during an emergency. All that traffic at once can clog the system, further delaying messages going through, he said.
The morning the Camp fire began, CodeRed alerts hit a busy signal at twice the rate the company typically sees in an emergency, Harper said. He noted that the alert system also sent out texts and emails to those who signed up.
“It’s not a blue sky day, so we expect to see some additional capacity on the infrastructure,” he said. “That’s why we always train our clients to use all modes of applicable communications.”
But the county did not use the federal Wireless Emergency Alert system that employs a separate frequency to send an Amber Alert-style tone, buzz and message to all cellphones in a specific area simultaneously.
“It’s one of the tools in the toolbox,” Harper said, adding that authorities can also use social media, go door-to-door with loudspeakers and employ the federal emergency alert system that reaches televisions and radios.
Friday’s reports come amid growing concern about the lack of warning residents received before the Camp fire, which destroyed more than 14,000 homes.
At a legislative hearing earlier this week, emergency experts and lawmakerspointed to numerous problemswith the town’s evacuation and said the state must work to improve its warning system.
Paradise officials initially limited evacuation orders to just the side of town closest to the fire — hoping to keep the limited exit routes clear for those who needed to escape first.
Some residents heard of the evacuation order from police cars driving by, barking the warnings through a loudspeaker. Others had to find out by door knocks or text messages from neighbors.
The strategy failed — the blaze moved too fast. The police chief said there was no time for a citywide evacuation order — the city’s own system went down in the midst of a partial order.
Some regions of Paradise were not told to evacuate until hours after the blaze had burned through. Resident Keri Bush said her home security cameras showed the house burned by fire roughly two hours before the 4:17 p.m. order to evacuate came through.
California has experienced unprecedented destruction from wildfires over the last two years, which has highlighted major flaws in the emergency alert systems, including a failure to use the latest technology to broadcast Amber Alert-style warnings on cellphones ahead of deadly disasters.
The Sonoma County Sheriff’s Office decided not to send a blanket alert over the federal Wireless Emergency Alert system as the Tubbs fire leaped from wildlands into Santa Rosa last year. Many people were caught unaware about the fire’s path until they were at risk; some were awakened when the flames were on their doorsteps. At least 22 people died.
When the Woolsey fire swept into Malibu last month, many of the city’s residents said they received no warning when the blaze moved into their neighborhoods. Some of them complained to the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors, demanding that officials come up with a better emergency notification system.
At this week’s legislative hearing, Sen. Hannah-Beth Jackson (D-Santa Barbara) said only 45 of California’s 58 counties have signed on to a wireless emergency alert system that is tied to a federal warning program that transmits communications through cellphones and broadcasters when wildfires start.

"After 54 years at Laguna Beach home, a family moved to Paradise. Three weeks later, they lost everything in the Camp fire",https://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-paradise-family-20181130-story.html,2018-11-30,"Dick and Carol Stein loaded up a moving van and trailer in mid-October and drove away from their Laguna Beach home of 54 years, headed to a community in Northern California that Carol called “peaceful.”
Three weeks later, the couple were fleeing the Camp fire, which consumed their new house in Paradise.
“We left a very beautiful home that my husband had done so much personal work on, and that was heartbreaking. And then now, everything that we’ve ever gathered together through our 66 years [of marriage] is gone too,” said Carol, 83.
The couple and their daughter Linda — their live-in caregiver for several years — uprooted from Laguna on Oct. 18 to move closer to the couple’s grandson and his family in Chico.
Family photos, genealogical records that Carol had collected, nine bicycles and medals from Dick’s road-racing years — all of it went into the moving truck.
But on Nov. 8, “all their nostalgic, wonderful memories — gone,” said the couple’s youngest daughter, Susan.
The morning the Camp fire alighted on the eastern edge of Paradise and began roaring across more than 150,000 acres of Butte County, the Stein family was unaware of the coming danger.
Linda was at a bocce tournament in Reno with Susan, a legal secretary in Irvine. Their parents were tinkering in their new kitchen, where Dick, 85, was installing a faucet.
Carol’s phone rang with an urgent message from Matthew Schneider, their grandson. His wife had received an alert on her phone that the east side of Paradise was being evacuated. The Steins prepared to leave their home in west Paradise.
Dick began gathering clothes. Carol took cat treats into the bedroom, trying to coax their two 9-year-old cats out from under the bed and into carriers.
Within 15 minutes, flames began tearing down their street at 50 mph.
“They were gigantic — I’d say 30 to 40 feet high. Just one solid mass of fire,” Carol said. “The fire moved so quickly into our area … we didn’t know if we were going to escape it.”
With a few clothes, Carol’s ruby necklace and the ashes of her recently deceased nephew in hand, the couple loaded up their car again, this time to leave Paradise. The trees across the street were in flames as they left.
“My biggest concern most of the time was having to leave my cats behind,” Carol said. “That was really hard on me.”
The cats’ fate is unclear.
The Steins headed to their grandson’s home, joining what Carol called a “mass exodus” from Paradise.
At the bocce tournament in Reno, Susan received a call from her mother saying they were evacuating. Skyway, the only road out of Paradise still open, had been turned from two lanes to four, yet they were stuck in traffic. The air was so thick with smoke that they had to blindly follow the taillights of a truck in front of them. And they had no water.
Then the phone cut off.
“We were just dumbfounded, really. Just didn’t know what to do,” Susan said. “We were just hopeful we would get another call.”
Susan and Linda pored over news channels, trying to find updates about the fire. They saw stories about people abandoning their vehicles to run from the flames. The Camp fire would become California’s deadliest wildfire, killing about 85 people and wiping out nearly 19,000 buildings.
An hour after Carol’s call cut off, she called back.
“What a great relief that was, just to hear their voices,” Susan said. “And then to hear their story, [it] was just amazing that they made it out.”
Dick and Carol arrived at the Schneiders’ home in Chico later that day, but they weren’t safe for long. That evening, Chico was evacuating. Dick and Carol got into their car and, for the second time that day, fled the Camp fire. This time, they drove toward Reno, where they finally reached safety.
For two weeks, the couple stayed at a Reno hotel with Susan and Linda. The daughters spent every day with their parents, filing for emergency insurance funding, setting up a post office box to receive paperwork and, as Susan said, helping them “[get] their balance back.”
“They come from very hardy stock, I guess, because they are really resilient and just staying positive and [putting] one foot in front of the other,” Susan said. “They are really strong people.”
After a week staying with various family members, Dick, Carol and Linda left Wednesday for Oregon, where the couple’s third daughter, Catherine, lives. They are searching for a place to lease in Northern California. They still hope to live close to their grandson’s family, whose home survived the fire.
“We really, truly feel lucky to be alive,” Carol said. “That in itself is enough to keep us going.”

"For thousands of displaced Paradise residents, recovery is a whole new challenge",https://www.latimes.com/local/california/la-me-paradise-uncertain-future-20181127-story.html,2018-11-30,"Reporting from PARADISE, Calif. —Toward the end of a recent news conference held to update the public on the recovery effort in Paradise, a man rose from the audience with a question.
He understood that making the burn area safe for people to return to would be difficult. Especially with the near-constant threat of debris flows. But when could he go back?
“Two months? Three months? Six months? I have to know what to do,” he said, his voice quavering with emotion. “Where do I go from here?”
Across Butte County, about 50,000 people have been displaced from Paradise and the nearby towns of Concow and Magalia. Some of them barely escaped and have been so shaken by the wildfire that they’ve said they have no intention of returning.
Others are content to set their lives by law enforcement’s timetable — authorities have said that eastern and southern portions of Paradise might be opened to residents early next week, if the weather allows. Parts of Concow, Old Magalia and Yankee Hill could follow later in the week. After an initial 24-hour period for residents, those areas will then be open to the public.
Authorities are also hearing from a third group: evacuees who are desperate to visit their properties, but who live in parts of Paradise that will likely remain off-limits for several more weeks.
“I know that we’re receiving lots of calls from very frustrated people,” Butte County Sheriff Kory Honea said at a news conference earlier this week. “I would ask that you please understand this process and bear with us. We want to get you home as quickly as we possibly can.”
Although the Camp Fire has been fully contained, the ash-coated landscape it left behind remains full of hazards. Dozens of trees burned and weakened by the fire have to come down. Fried power lines have to be cleared and replaced. Tons of potentially toxic debris must be carted off.
Authorities have said that the town and its 18,000 homes and businesses destroyed by the fire are essentially one massive worksite and that residents can’t return until utility companies like Pacific Gas & Electric and AT&T say it is safe. Only about 1,700 structures are still standing.
People whose homes are in ruins should not live there, town officials said. They are drafting an ordinance that would ban living on destroyed property until all the debris and ash has been cleared.
At a meeting of the Paradise town council Wednesday night, Celestino’s pizza restaurant owner Alfonso Magdaleno was among those residents anxious to know when they can return. He wanted to open for business and fire up his ovens. “People will need food!” he said.
The owner of a machine shop fretted that he had to wait helplessly, separated from his expensive tools that might have survived the fire only to be destroyed by the rain.
Sheri McVey, 43, lost all her material possessions in the fire — her house, her car and the food truck that paid her bills. She does not live in one of the areas slated to be repopulated next week, which frustrates her.
“If it’s your home, I don’t understand why you can’t go in and look, though I understand there are dangers there,” she said.
She knows there is nothing left. But she said she needs to witness the devastation so she can accept it and move on.
“It’s more that I want to see it so I can dream about rebuilding,” she said.
But for the most part, residents’ frustration ebbed when Paradise Police Chief Eric Reinbold said he hoped the town would open within the next three weeks.
One of the significant impediments to reopening Paradise to residents has been the weeks-long search for human remains.
Honea announced on Wednesday that searchers have completed the grim task, though he warned residents of the possibility that they could stumble across bone fragments as they return and should notify authorities if they do. The death toll stands at 88, but 196 people are still considered missing.
Paradise Councilman Michael Zuccolillo said he felt overwhelmed by the scale of the destruction and the task of making the town livable again.
“I feel that we’re over our heads,” he said of the town council. “None of us have experience in disaster recovery to his magnitude.”
The town needs to hire someone who does, he said.
“We need help,” he said. “Massive amounts of help.”
Most of the town’s functions are being handled through Paradise’s emergency operations center, set up at a fire training center used by the city of Chico. City EOC manager Jim Broshears, who for decades was Paradise’s fire chief, said almost all of the town’s employees have lost their homes.
“Some of them are, you know, struggling to deal with it,” he said. Some employees haven’t shown up for work, while others have thrown themselves into ceaseless recovery work. “We’ve had to say, we’re ordering you off today,” he said.
Paradise may be off limits to the vast majority of its residents and business owners, but several home insurance companies said that has not stopped them from issuing at least partial payments to policyholders.
According to Nancy Kincaid, a spokeswoman for California’s Department of Insurance, damage assessors have only recently been allowed into barricaded areas, escorted by the department’s law enforcement branch.
Insurers said they have been using satellite imagery and Cal Fire photographs to confirm structure loss. Most declined to provide figures on how much they’ve paid so far to Butte County customers, but a spokesman for State Farm said that as of Tuesday it had received more than 2,000 claims and paid nearly $60 million for damage stemming from the Camp fire.
At the downtown Chico post office Wednesday, fire survivors waited in line to retrieve their mail. It is a ritual that is becoming routine for people living in motels or with friends.
Nearly three weeks after the fire, some are making pivotal decisions and will soon leave the post office line behind.
Marlene Dunn, 72, has already submitted a change of address form. She and her husband will not return to Magalia after losing their house, car and two elderly cats in the fire.
They moved up north three years ago because Dunn had a good friend there and it was too expensive to retire in Southern California. Now, they are going back to San Diego, where their children live.
Jennifer Petersen said she understands why officials think it isn’t safe for residents to go back. She and her husband, Michael, have been staying at a Yuba City motel, crammed in with their two adult children and five dogs.
She is eager to check on her chickens, which she had to leave behind, as well as the community garden she managed. Maybe, just maybe, something had survived.
Petersen, who was born and raised in Paradise, said whether to rebuild is not even a question.
“It’s a long road back, but we’ll get there,” her husband said.

College football viewers’ guide: Playoff spots and New Year’s six bowls are up for grabs,https://www.latimes.com/sports/more/la-sp-college-football-tv-20181129-story.html,2018-11-30,"It’s conference championship weekend in college football, which means it’s time to cancel your other Friday and Saturday plans to binge-watch games from morning until late night. The Times’ Eduardo Gonzalez lets us know what will be on our televisions and computer screens the next two days.
FRIDAY
No. 17 Utah(9-3)vs. No. 11 Washington(9-3), 5 p.m., Channel 11
Although the Pac-12 will be left out of the College Football Playoff for a second consecutive season, a trip to the Rose Bowl is never a bad consolation prize. Utah was the only Pac-12 South team never to appear in the conference title game until now. USC is the only South team to win the Pac-12. Washington beat Utah 21-7 in Salt Lake City in September and enters the rematch at Levi’s Stadium in Santa Clara after a 28-15 victory over Washington State in the Apple Cup. The Utes came back from 20 points down to defeat Brigham Young 35-27 last week.
4 p.m.:Northern Illinois vs. Buffalo (Mid-American Conference championship), ESPN2.
SATURDAY MORNING
No. 14 Texas(9-3)vs. No. 5 Oklahoma(11-1), 9 a.m., Channel 7
The spotlight will be on the quarterbacks in this rematch for the Big 12 title in Arlington, Texas. Oklahoma’s Kyler Murray helped the Sooners escape West Virginia 59-56 by passing for 364 yards and three touchdowns. Sam Ehlinger helped the Longhorns beat Kansas 24-17, passing for two scores and running for another. For Oklahoma, a win would avenge a 48-45 loss to Texas in October and possibly push the Sooners into the College Football Playoff.
9 a.m.:Louisiana at Appalachian State (Sun Belt Conference championship), ESPN; Akron at South Carolina, SEC Network.
10:30 a.m.:Alabama Birmingham at Middle Tennessee (Conference USA championship), CBS Sports Network.
SATURDAY AFTERNOON
Stanford(7-4)at California(7-4), 12 p.m., Pac-12 Network
The Big Game was originally scheduled for Nov. 17, but was postponed to this weekend because of the poor air quality resulting from wildfires. Stanford escaped a motivated UCLA team 49-42 last week behind K.J. Costello’s 344 passing yards and five touchdowns. Cal forced five turnovers, including two interceptions returned for touchdowns, in a 33-21 win over Colorado. Stanford has won eight in a row against Cal.
Memphis(8-4)at No. 8 Central Florida(11-0), 12:30 p.m., Channel 7
Memphis came close to ruining Central Florida’s perfect season in October, but the Knights rallied for a 31-30 win. Central Florida has won 24 in a row but enters the American Athletic Conference championship game without quarterback McKenzie Milton, who suffered a potential career-ending knee injury last week against South Florida. Memphis has won its last four games and is coming off a 52-31 victory over Houston that put the Tigers in the title game.
No. 1 Alabama(12-0)vs. Georgia(11-1), 1 p.m., Channel 2
It only has been 11 months since these teams played a memorable national championship game that Alabama won in overtime. They again will play at Mercedes-Benz Stadium in Atlanta, the winner this time earning the Southeastern Conference title. Georgia coach Kirby Smart gets another shot at trying to become the first Nick Saban disciple to beat the Crimson Tide coach.
No. 2 Clemson(12-0)vs. Pittsburgh(7-5), 5 p.m., Channel 7
The Atlantic Coast Conference will be decided at Charlotte, N.C. Clemson is 0-2 all-time against Pittsburgh, including a 43-42 loss that was the Tigers’ only defeat during their 2016 national championship season. Clemson is looking to make the College Football Playoff for the fourth season in a row. The Panthers are coming off a 24-3 loss to Miami last week.
No. 21 Northwestern(8-4)vs. No. 6 Ohio State(11-1), 5 p.m., Channel 11
A month ago, this matchup for the Big Ten Conference title seemed unlikely. But both teams made late surges to reach the game in Indianapolis. Ohio State might even make it to the playoffs with a statement win. The Buckeyes made a case last week in their 62-39 win over Michigan as Dwayne Haskins passed for 396 yards and six touchdowns. The Wildcats survived against Illinois 24-16, with Isaiah Bowser rushing for 166 yards.
4:45 p.m.:No. 25 Fresno State at No. 22 Boise State (Mountain West Conference championship), ESPN.

Deputy’s body cam captures harrowing escape from deadly Northern California fire,https://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-ln-lawman-escapes-deadly-fire-video-20181129-story.html,2018-11-30,"Body camera video released by the Butte County Sheriff’s Office shows Deputy Aaron Parmley evacuating a retirement home in Paradise, Calif., and narrowly escaping the Camp fire Nov. 8 with four nurses and a California Highway Patrol officer after hi
Reporting from Paradise, Calif. —Aaron Parmley knew it was a bad day when when he woke up Nov. 8, but it wasn’t until the Butte County sheriff’s deputy found himself trapped in the burning town of Paradise that he realized it might be his last.
The 23-year-old was attempting to evacuate four nurses and a California Highway Patrol officer when the engine of his cruiser died. As flames crackled on both sides of Pearson Road and thick smoke stole his breath, Parmley flipped on his department-issued body camera.
“I wanted to turn it on,” he remembered thinking, “in case I die.”
On Thursday, the Butte County Sheriff’s Office released footage from Parmley’s camera, which captured the group’s harrowing escape from the state’s deadliest and most destructive wildfire on record. The video was requested by the Los Angeles Times under the California Public Records Act, and officials subsequently released it.
In an interview with The Times, Parmley said he had woken up that morning to text messages about a big fire in nearby Concow and soon heard radio traffic of other deputies heading up the hill to evacuate people.
Racing toward the flames, Parmley was the first deputy to arrive at Adventist Health Feather River hospital. The evacuation appeared to be going well, so he decided to get closer to the fire, which was farther east.
He drove up Canyon View Drive, which overlooks the Feather River Canyon, just north of California’s second-largest reservoir, Lake Oroville.
The fire was 20 yards away from a retirement home, Feather Canyon Gracious Retirement Living, and again, Parmley was the first deputy there. There was a long line of elderly patients waiting to get into a tiny, 16-person shuttle.
“The manager said that no one had been evacuated yet. And that there were 140 people that needed to be evacuated,” he said.
At the retirement home, Parmley’s camera recorded the howl of wind and glowing flames everywhere. “It’s embers,” Parmley said to himself. “It’s not good.”
Parmley radioed for help and started evacuating the building. Multiple cop cars arrived, as did vans from the jail. Soon there was a long line of cars arriving to pick up loved ones.
“We just started shoving everybody into those random cars, and everybody got out,” Parmley said.
Within half an hour, “there was fire everywhere. And you could hardly see. There was black smoke. And it was terrible,” he said. He was the last person out.
Parmley made his way out to Pentz Road, one of only three main north-south routes in this mountaintop town hemmed in by canyons on both sides.
He headed south in his Ford Crown Victoria, clearing traffic on Pearson Road as flames got even closer, and then headed north to help evacuate the town of Magalia.
But he got stuck in traffic just north of the evacuated hospital. As his car filled with smoke, a firefighter emerged and knocked on his door. Traffic was blocked northbound, the firefighter said, turn around. Oh, and hey — he had four nurses who needed to leave with Parmley, the firefighter said.
Parmley took the nurses — three women and a man — and headed south on Pentz Road, but soon, “it was impassable,” he said. He headed west on Pearson Road, trying to get the nurses to one of the other escape routes down to the Sacramento Valley, but there was fire everywhere, and he could see no more than 10 yards.
He saw a California Highway Patrol car stopped in the middle of the road, close to Rockford Lane, and Officer Nick Powell asked for help — another car had broken down and there were people stranded. Parmley, Powell and the male nurse moved them into another fleeing car and directed the remaining cars out, as embers rained over the road and landed in their hair.
But Powell had one more favor to ask — his vehicle was totaled after another car fleeing the fire amid heavy smoke collided with the cruiser.
“Hop in my car,” Parmley said. Powell squeezed into the front passenger seat with a nurse, while the others sat in the rear seat.
But something was wrong with the Crown Vic. Parmley had left the car running while he assisted the other evacuees, but now the engine was dead. He tried starting it up again, but nothing happened.
“We have to walk,” he told the others. He radioed that he was evacuating his car and had to repeat himself three times to be heard. Then, he hurt his ankle while trying to leave his car and head east to Pentz Road.
“Everything was engulfed in flames around us,” Parmley said. “It was hard to see, and hard to breathe.
“I thought that was where I was going to die.”
Some of the nurses called their loved ones to say goodbye.
Minutes passed.
Parmley’s body cam video revealed a landscape drenched in darkness and flame. Giant embers rained on the roadway, and both sides of the road glowed red.
“It’s bad,” Parmley said in the video.
Voices on the police radio were grim. “It’s almost impossible to get somebody in there,” a voice said.
Then he could hear rumbling in the distance. “Are they coming for us?” a nurse asked.
Moments later, the headlights of a bulldozer pierced the veil of smoke.
“There’s someone here to save us,” he thought. “I have never been happier in my entire life than when I saw that bulldozer.”
“Can we get in?” Parmley said.
“Yeah, come on,” the driver said.
Then a woman can be heard saying, “There’s no room.”
“Get in,” Parmley said. The driver is heard saying, “I can’t fit everybody.”
Then came the glorious honk of a fire engine, pulling up behind them, with enough room to get them out of there.
Parmley clambered up the truck, took a deep breath, and placed his hand on his chest, turning off the camera.

California senators ask Congress for $9 billion for wildfire recovery,https://www.latimes.com/politics/la-na-pol-congress-wildfire-funding-20181129-story.html,2018-11-30,"Reporting from Washington —California needs just more than $9 billion in disaster aid to recover from this fall’s wildfires, Sens. Dianne Feinstein and Kamala Harris said in a letter to colleagues Thursday.
“The scale of the destruction from this month’s wildfires is unprecedented…. State and local governments in California are still in the early stages of recovery from this disaster and are still assessing damages and impacts,” the state’s senatorssaid in their letter.
California is reeling from the Camp fire in Butte County, which killed at least 88 people, burned the entire town of Paradise and destroyed almost 14,000 homes. The Woolsey and Hill fires in Southern California killed three people, destroyed nearly 400 homes and burned 100,000 acres.
Congress is focused on an end-of-year spending package to fund the Department of Homeland Security and several other major agencies, which they need to pass by Dec. 7 to avoid a partial government shutdown.
There is a chance that the spending package will include disaster recovery funding for damage from the fires and several hurricanes that hit other parts of the country, Senate Appropriations Committee Chairman Richard C. Shelby (R-Ala.) said.
“We’re still not there yet,” Shelby said.
The total amount needed is still unclear, he said this week.
The senators’ requested amount is in line with what Gov. Jerry Brown, working with local officials, said is needed to help Californians recover.

Inmate firefighter escapes from Northern California work camp,https://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-ln-inmate-escapes-20181231-story.html,2018-12-31,"Reporting from Sacramento —Corrections officials are searching for an inmate who escaped from a minimum-security facility in Northern California.
The California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation said Nicolas Dunning, 32, was discovered missing from the Konocti Conservation Camp on Monday morning.
The camp in Lake County is home to about 95 minimum-security inmates who help fight wildfires, according to the agency’s website. Lt. Charlene Billings said Dunning was assigned as a firefighter but was not working when he disappeared.
Dunning is the fifth state inmate to escape this month. Three were captured. Authorities are still searching for 27-year-old Justin Franks, who escaped from Folsom State Prison on Dec. 22. Shalom Mendoza, 21, was taken into custody Saturday at a fast-food restaurant in Paso Robles after escaping from San Quentin State Prison three days earlier.

"Winter is shrinking, study finds, posing new fire and water risks",https://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-winter-shrinking-study-fire-water-risks-20181231-story.html,2018-12-31,"Across the mountains of the West, the landscape of winter is changing.
Deep snowpacks that held fast through winter, then melted in a torrent each spring, are instead seeping away earlier in the year. The period of winter weather is shrinking too, with autumn lasting longer and spring starting earlier.
The findings by Amato Evan, a professor of atmospheric and climate science withScripps Institution of Oceanography, show changes to western hydrology that could jeopardize water resources, flood control, fire management and winter recreation.
His results were published this month in the Journal of Applied Meteorology and Climatology and presented at the American Geophysical Union Fall Meeting in Washington.
Aerial photos and snow surveys illustrate how levels vary from year to year. But Evan’s study looked not only at how much snow there is, but also how it accumulates and then runs off.
Climate models have predicted the snowpack would diminish earlier in the season and melt more gradually as the planet warms. Evan affirmed those projections through an analysis of data from 1982 through 2017.
“There are theoretical models that say as the planet continues to warm, this is what should happen; snow melts earlier in the year, and doesn’t melt as fast as it does in the springtime,” he said. “We went back to the mathematics, and said, that’s actually exactly what we’re seeing.”
The readings come from 400 snow telemetry sensors across the West. They’re made of cushions filled with antifreeze that compress and expand as snow falls and melts, and sensors that record the changes. The data are hard to work with, though, because there’s so much day-to-day variation in storms and snow levels at each site.
“If you’re interested in climate, all those little blips obscure how that is changing over the last four decades,” Evan said.
To address that, Evan devised a mathematical formula to cut through the noise of the data and reveal trends in snowfall and melting. The calculations showed how the whole system was shifting because of higher temperatures.
“If we use the mathematical analysis, it tells you more about physical processes,” he said.
Dan Cayan, a Scripps researcher who studies climate effects on water, wildfire, health and agriculture and was not involved in the study, said those changes could upend water management systems in the West.
“Of course snowpack has traditionally been used as an extra reservoir in the western states, and particularly in California,” he said. “It has some really nice properties, in that it doesn’t melt off until the latter spring and early summer, when there are a lot of water needs, particularly with our agricultural landscapes.”
Moreover, he said, California’s water system is designed to harness powerful storms that pose both risks and benefits.
“Water resources and water hazards are intimately tied together in California,” Cayan said.
Western mountains have historically released their water after winter storms have passed, but with snowmelt and storms occurring at the same time, the risk of floods increases. The near collapse of theOroville Damin February 2017 illustrates the kinds of dangers California could face with earlier runoff.
“We’re getting snowmelt at a time when a big storm which has both rain and snow could happen, and could overwhelm the flood control capacity of a given reservoir in that earlier season,” he said. “So that’s a feature of climate change that is really a threat, that water managers are going to have to contend with.”
Catastrophic wildfires are another peril of the changing regimen. Snowmelt dampens the risk of wildfire forCalifornia’s forestsduring spring and early summer. If it runs off sooner, that could leave those woodlands parched and fragile.
“When snow melts earlier in the year ... that means the soils dry out earlier in the year,” Evan said. “That means those forest ecosystems become drier. So in a sense, we can lengthen the fire season.”
Early snowmelt also poses problems for tourism, particularly for mid- and lower-elevation ski resorts, and threatens part of the state’s natural heritage, Cayan said.
“The snowpack is such an iconic feature, for many reasons,” he said.
The study’s findings show that the pace ofclimate changeis now catching up to projections, and can be seen on the ground, Evan said.
“Some of these results really have only been seen in modeling studies,” he said. “The fact that we can see them now in observations means that climate change in the western U.S. is not something we will see in the next 50 years. It’s something that’s happening now. We can see it right now.”

"Criminal charges against PG&E possible if utility is found responsible for recent wildfires, prosecutors say",https://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-ln-pge-prosecution-charges-20181230-story.html,2018-12-31,"Pacific Gas & Electric Co. could be charged with murder or involuntary manslaughter if authorities determine that recent deadly California wildfires ignited as a result of the “reckless” operation or maintenance of power lines, state prosecutors said.
In a court filing Friday, California Atty. Gen. Xavier Becerra’s office detailed potential criminal charges the utility could face if found responsible forwildfires in the state that have killed dozens of peopleand destroyed thousands of homes; possible charges include failing to keep power lines clear of trees or vegetation, recklessly starting a forest fire and murder.
A spokesperson for the utility released a statement Sunday in response to the filing but declined to comment further.
“PG&E’s most important responsibility is public and workforce safety. Our focus continues to be on assessing our infrastructure to further enhance safety and helping our customers continue to recover and rebuild,” the statement said. “Throughout our service area, we are committed to doing everything we can to help further reduce the risk of wildfire.”
The attorney general’s filing came at the request of a federal judge overseeing the utility’s probation in a criminal case stemming from the deadly San Bruno gas pipeline blast in 2010, which killed eight people. PG&E was sentenced to five years’ probation and ordered to pay a $3-million fine in that case.
U.S. District Judge William Alsup asked Becerra’s office to identify each potential criminal offense the utility could face in connection with the blazes.
He also asked the utility, federal prosecutors and an independent monitor reviewing the company’s safety performance as part of the San Bruno case to weigh in on PG&E’s actions since the sentencing, setting a Monday deadline. As of Sunday night, only Becerra’s office had filed a response.
Laurie Levenson, professor at Loyola Law School, said the severity of charges the utility faces depends on whether it was “on notice of the risk that their equipment may start the fires and lead to deaths.”
“Callous disregard of that risk could be murder,” she said. “The more likely charge would probably be involuntary manslaughter, which requires criminal negligence…. The real key here is how much risk they realized they were taking and why they took it.”
Though companies can’t be jailed if held criminally liable, they can be fined and debarred from contracts. When that happens, it is like a corporate death penalty, Levenson said.
State prosecutors said the utility’s criminal liability would depend on its degree of recklessness.
“ ‘Recklessness’ could include the mental state of multiple offenses. These mental states resemble a sliding scale. As the mental state becomes more culpable, the applicable offense becomes more serious,” the filing said.
It continued: “At criminal negligence, PG&E could have committed involuntary manslaughter, starting a fire without permission, and failing to keep its lines and poles clear of vegetation. At recklessness … PG&E could have committed the felony of unlawfully starting a fire. And at malice, PG&E could have committed murder.”
Butte County Dist. Atty. Mike Ramsey told the Sacramento Beethat he hasn’t decided whether to file criminal charges against PG&E over the Camp fire, even if the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection determines the company is at fault.
“It’s a little premature,” he said.
In the filing, state prosecutors don’t offer a position on PG&E’s criminal liability or whether the utility caused the fires. But PG&E is facing intense criticism andat least 20 lawsuitsthat allege the utility allowed its equipment to spark the deadliest wildfire on record in California history.
One lawsuit points to a small metal hook on an electrical transmission tower as the cause in the Camp fire, which killed 86 people and displaced up to 50,000 in Butte County. When it failed, the suit alleges, an uninsulated wire touched the tower, caused sparks and ignited the blaze.
Another blasts a corporate culture that allegedly places “reputation above public safety” along with advertising that “promotes a false and misleading picture” of Northern California’s electricity supply.
Other suits blame the general decay of the region’s electrical infrastructure and the failure to trim trees and brush that grew too close to poles and power lines.

California lawmakers grill top utilities regulator over wildfire prevention,https://www.latimes.com/politics/la-pol-ca-safety-wildfires-legislature-20190130-story.html,2019-01-31,"Reporting from Sacramento —Under intense questioning from state lawmakers, California’s top utilities regulator said the state is ill-equipped to deal with a new reality of destructive and deadly wildfires brought on by climate change.
“I don’t think we are prepared for, in any way here in the state of California, for the enormity that we’re seeing,” said Michael Picker, president of the California Public Utilities Commission. “We need more. We need more thinking. We need more ideas.”
Picker made the comments in testimony Wednesday during the agency’s annual oversight hearing in the state Assembly.
The commission, charged with enforcing electrical safety to prevent wildfires, is facing growing scrutiny after years of increasingly dangerous blazes that have been linked to power lines and utility equipment. After the Camp fire killed 86 people in Butte County in November, legislators implored Picker to explain efforts the agency has taken to ensure utilities are meeting safety guidelines to prevent wildfires before the onset of the 2019 wildfire season.
“I didn’t hear anything that gave me the comfort that there are plans that are going to make people safer,” said Assemblyman Jim Wood (D-Healdsburg), who attended the hearing.
The Times reported this weekthat a team of just 19 people at the CPUC performs preventive safety audits and spot checks to ensure vegetation is cut back a safe distance from lines before wildfires strike. Representatives from the agency said it had started a process Wednesday to eventually grow that number to 100, including contractors.
Still, Picker said the state would need at least 15,000 people to monitor the 250,000 miles of power lines and 4.2 million utility poles that deliver electricity to homes and businesses throughout the state. He argued that adding more staff won’t solve the problem and said the state needs to invest in better technology.
The Legislature spent months conducting hearings last year to craft and pass Senate Bill 901, wide-reaching legislation that included new plans the utilities must submit to prevent wildfires and addressed key issues such as forest management and legal liability. Picker pointed to the Camp fire to suggest the bill didn’t go far enough, while defending what some lawmakers consider a slow process at the CPUC to implement the legislation.
The agency’s structure limits its ability to move quickly, Picker said. By law, the CPUC must gather input on decisions from stakeholder groups in a process similar to a court system overseen by administrative law judges.
“If you want an agency that can move more quickly, maybe this is not the right kind of agency,” Picker said.
He offered little when lawmakers asked whether the state needed to create a new agency to be responsible for wildfire safety.
“These are choices that are tough to make,” Picker said. “We can’t make them. You have to do that.”
The hearing came as lawmakers continue to weigh new legislation to address wildfires, some of which would cost billions of dollars.
Assemblyman Jim Frazier (D-Oakley) introduced a bill this week to require utilities to move transmission lines out of highly fire-prone areas, bury the lines underground or improve the equipment to minimize risk.
Wood’s Assembly Bill 38 would require the state to review building standards in high-risk areas and allow property owners to access $1 billion in state-funded loans for projects to update buildings.

PG&E admits its equipment likely sparked California’s most destructive wildfire,https://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-pge-paradise-fire-20190228-story.html,2019-03-01,"Nearly four months after California’s most devastating wildfire swept through Paradise and surrounding towns, Pacific Gas & Electric Co. has acknowledged that its equipment probably sparked the blaze that destroyed nearly 14,000 homes and killed 85 people, most of them elderly.
The official investigation into the cause of the Butte County blaze is continuing, but the utility said Thursday that “the company believes it is probable that its equipment will be determined to be an ignition point of the 2018 Camp fire.”
PG&E has alreadyfiled for bankruptcyprotection due to losses from the Nov. 8 fire, which scorched more than 153,000 acres and has placed new pressure on utilities to improve the safety of their power distribution systems.
Scores of lawsuits have been filed against the state’s biggest utility on behalf of people whose loved ones were killed, whose pets disappeared into the blazing wilderness and who lost everything they owned. They accuse the utility of failing to properly maintain its equipment.
Response to PG&E’s statement was swift and resigned Thursday.
“I’m not surprised, but what can you do?” asked Terry Bates, whose home in Paradise — population about 26,600 on Nov. 7 — was destroyed.
Bates was a groundskeeper at Feather River Hospital, which was damaged and has not reopened. He currently works at one of Feather River’s clinics, which was spared. He was able to buy a house in Oroville, but his commute has grown from five minutes to 40.
“We’re going to rebuild, I think,” he said. “We’re not even cleaned up yet…. We haven’t found the cat.”
John Cronister, 59, is living in a travel trailer without water or electricity on his burned-out lot in Paradise. The retiree hopes the level of destruction in Butte County will move PG&E — which he said is way too big — to improve preventive maintenance of its equipment.
“Someone at the top is not doing their job, not paying attention,” Cronister said. “Those people should go to jail for what’s happened here.”
Attorney Joseph W. Cotchett, whose Burlingame firm represents more than 1,000 victims of Northern California wildfires with PG&E involvement, said Thursday, “It’s about time they’ve come to the table and admitted what everyone has known for a long time.”
The Camp fire, he said, is “one more example of profits over safety. Something has to be done to either break up PG&E and/or put a public utilities commission in place that is truly going to protect the public. So many people have innocently died because of the lack of safety precautions taken by this utility. It goes back years.”
In fact, most of the Camp fire lawsuits cite a grim catalog of death and destruction involving PG&E. Among the disasters are a 1991 gas explosion in Santa Rosa that killed two people; the Butte fire in 2015, which killed two; and the 2010 San Bruno gas line explosion, which killed eight and saw the company found guilty of six felonies and fined more than $1.6 billion.
Most of the suits also cite the so-called wine country, or North Bay, wildfires — a series of fires in 2017 that caused 44 deaths and displaced nearly 100,000 people.
“While the fires had numerous origin points, they all shared a common alleged cause — unsafe electrical infrastructure owned, operated and maintained by PG&E,” according to a suit filed on behalf of the town of Paradise.
Paradise Mayor Jody Jones said she saw her community’s anger at the utility manifest itself when locals threw rocks at the workers in town to make repairs.
“I want to make a distinction between those workers who gave up their beds and family life to try and put our town back together, and the corporate structure with the maintenance of our lines,” Jones said. “Sometimes people can’t see the difference between the two. But if to provide benefits to shareholders, they were deferring maintenance, they have to be held accountable for that.”
Another suit, filed in December, said a damaged metal hook or ring on a transmission tower was at least partly to blame for the fire. When it failed, the suit said, it allowed an uninsulated cable to touch the steel tower.
“Blazing hot molten materials dropped into the fine dead fuels below … igniting the devastating Camp Fire,” the suit claims. “Strong winds, low humidity, and dry vegetation fueled the fire. The intensity of the heat generated by the fire and the terrifying speed at which it spread are unimaginable.”
PG&E said a Chapter 11 bankruptcy filing, which allows the company to continue operating while it comes up with a plan to pay its debts, was the only way to deal with billions of dollars in potential liabilities from theseries of deadly wildfires.
Paradise Councilman Steven Crowder said he was concerned about what this means for ratepayers.
“I do have a problem with the [Public Utilities Commission] if they allow them to increase rates to pay for their mistakes, although I fully expect that is what is going to happen — that is what has happened in the past,” he said.
PG&E has blamed its wildfire costs in part on climate change, which scientists say iscontributing to bigger and hotter firesin California and across the Western United States. The company has also pushed lawmakers to rewrite the state’s strict liability laws, which allow utilities to be held liable for wildfires started by their equipmenteven if they follow all safety rules and aren’t found to be negligent.
The utility has estimated its potential wildfire liabilities at $30 billion or more, but that figure includes losses fromthe Tubbs fire,the biggest of the 2017 wine country fires. The California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection announced last month thatthe Tubbs fire was not caused by PG&E,as initially believed, which by some estimates could cut the company’s potential liabilities in half.
In Thursday’s statement, officials said the company was facing “extraordinary challenges” relating to the 2017 and 2018 fires. “Management has concluded that these circumstances raise substantial doubt about PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s ability to continue as going concerns,” the statement said.
Rep. Doug LaMalfa (R-Richvale) said PG&E’s announcement that it was recording a $10.5-billion charge for legal claims was a sign the company was trying to move forward responsibly.
The company needs to be held accountable for any missteps it made in maintaining its equipment, he said, but he also blames state and federal forest management policies. “Government does play a role and shoulders some of the responsibility for a lot of the wildfires around here,” he said.
Mark Toney, executive director of the Utility Reform Network, does not share that view. His watchdog organization wants the federal court to appoint a receiver to run the company. He said senior management and the PG&E board should be stocked with engineers, not lawyers and people in finance.
“PG&E is a repeat felon,” Toney said. “They are unable to operate safely and comply with the law.”

"Tree-trimming guidelines in Edison wildfire plan may go too far, arborist says",https://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-ln-tree-trimming-20190228-story.html,2019-02-28,"Southern California Edison is making big plans to reduce the chances of fire ignition in high-risk areas such as La Cañada Flintridge, proposing to spend more than $118 million throughout its service area on enhanced vegetation management between now and 2020.
As part of a 119-page Wildfire Mitigation Plan, required by state law and submitted to the California Public Utilities Commission on Feb. 6, the utility aims to reduce threats posed by falling trees and hanging limbs near power lines by removing at least 7,500 trees (with funding being sought for the removal of up to 15,000) in 2019 and maintaining a 12-foot clearance around all electrical wires.
Contracted work crews have been busy on the streets of La Cañada and neighboring Altadena in recent months, trimming or topping trees to accommodate the new radial requirement, far greater than the 4 feet standard previously imposed.
The results of their labor — visible on several La Cañada residential streets north of Foothill Boulevard — is causing concern among at least one arborist and residents who fear such extreme pruning could imperil the health of certain tree species.
“They’re topping trees, which are going to go into a permanent state of decline,” said Rebecca Latta, a longtime arborist who has clients in La Cañada. “They need to do a better job of explaining to us why they need to go to 12 feet.”
At a wildfire town hall last week at Pasadena High School, officials from Edison International and the CPUC explained maintaining vegetation was a chief concern.
“We collect statistics on ignitions,” said Elizaveta Malashenko, deputy executive director for CPUC’s Office of Safety and Enforcement. “At 25%, the top No. 1 cause is vegetation contact with power lines.”
Between 2015 and 2017, 132 ignitions occurred in the distribution voltage infrastructure that carries power from substations to customers in Edison’s high-risk fire areas, the utility’s mitigation plan indicates. Of those, contact from vegetation accounted for 22 fires, or 17%.
Vegetation-related ignitions in higher voltage transmission infrastructure, which carries power from power plants to substations, was lower, with only one instance during the same two-year period, accounting for 5% of fires.
Pedro Pizarro, president and chief executive of Edison International, told the town hall audience that his utility inspects and trims more than 400,000 trees in high-risk fire areas each year.
“We know that homeowners care deeply for their surrounding environment and foliage, and we want to respect that,” he said. “However, we will prioritize safety of your home and our communities first and foremost, so we will trim trees when needed.”
Following orders to maintain adequate clearance, some 400 contractor work crews consisting of at least one groundsman and one foreman are inspecting private trees on residential streets throughout Edison’s territory and notifying customers when work is needed.
La Cañada is an area of high concern, according to David Guzman, who oversees Edison’s vegetation management program.
“There are a lot of trees in that area, it has a dense population, and it’s at an interface with the [Angeles National] Forest, so it’s definitely something we look at closely,” he said.
In the past, branches were trimmed back to a 4-foot radius around trees, with fast-growing species receiving at least 6 more feet of pruning, Guzman said. But since the CPUC passed a new regulation in December 2017 recommending a 12-foot clearance for all vegetation in high-fire-risk areas — even when lines are covered or insulated — the particular species of a tree no longer factors into the pruning.
“We have a basic, across-the-board trim area of 12 feet,” Guzman said, adding arborists pre-inspect trees.
Latta worries over-trimmed trees may suffer and become even greater fire hazards.
“If you top the tree, you expose the whole upper canopy to sunburn. And if you have any other issues going on, root rot or other health problems, the tree doesn’t have enough resources to defend itself,” she said, naming deodar cedars and some pines as particularly vulnerable.
The arborist also claimed some homeowners were not receiving proper notice before trim work was done on their property.
Guzman said customers receive door hanger notifications from inspectors at least 30 days in advance and a second notice days before trimming is scheduled. If people cannot reach the number provided, Guzman recommended calling Edison at (800) 655-4555 and asking for a vegetation management manager who can look up properties and report details.
Despite the established notification process, Pizarro warned residents at the Feb. 21 town hall that public safety trumps standard operating procedures.
“Of course we want to give advance notice, but if we see something we think is a hazard, we’ll take it on the spot,” he said.
Edison’s enhanced vegetation management plan just doesn’t sit right with La Cañada resident Taylor Carbonetti, who had a crew perform some trimming at her Hill Street home, but was shocked to see what she considers over-pruning in several other parts of town.
“It looks like if you were making paper trees and you just took scissors and took all the tops off — it’s intense,” said Carbonetti, who went on Facebook to inform neighbors. “You’re walking around and start noticing all these trees are chopped. And we’re seeing the trucks everywhere.”
Meanwhile, Latta said she appreciates Edison’s efforts to keep at-risk foothill communities safe, but wishes they would have developed a more collaborative approach, with input from stakeholders. She’s currently trying to raise awareness in local arborist circles.
“It’s not my intention to do anything other than get their attention and get them to develop some options,” she said. “Why is it we’re not being allowed to be part of the conversation?”

Reporting from Forestville, Calif. —Gov. Gavin Newsom on Thursday declared a state of emergency in five Northern California counties where severe storms have led to flooding that has left some towns completely isolated.
The emergency proclamationrequests immediate assistance for Amador, Glenn, Lake, Mendocino and Sonoma counties through the Federal Highway Administration’s Emergency Relief Program and the Office of Emergency Services to provide assistance to local governments.
Newsom previously declared anemergency for 21 countiesacross the state because of severe weather.
One of the winter’s strongest storms brought flooding across Northern California on Wednesday, with no region hit harder than Guerneville and the Russian River Valley, which has been inundated repeatedly over the decades.
Some 3,600 people in about two dozen communities near the river were evacuated by the flooding, which prompted the Sonoma County Board of Supervisors to declare a local emergency. Authorities warned that those who chose to stay in their homes could be stuck there for days.
“We have waterfront property now,” said Dane Pitcher, 70, who watched from the third-story window of his bed and breakfast, the Raford Inn in Healdsburg, as rising water pooled to create a 100-acre lake in front of his property. “We’re marooned for all intents and purposes.”
The Russian River, which sat about 10 feet Monday morning, rose an extraordinary 34 feet over two days, said Carolina Walbrun, meteorologist with the National Weather Service in the Bay Area. By Wednesday afternoon, the river had swollen to 44.3 feet — more than 12 feet above flood stage. One rain gauge near Guerneville reported receiving nearly 20.5 inches of rain in 48 hours by early Wednesday, turning the town into a Russian River island.
By nighttime, an estimated 2,000 homes and other buildings had flooded, rescuers had saved about 40 people stuck in floodwaters and authorities had closed 89 roads as the river swelled to about 45 feet — 13 feet above flood stage, said Sonoma County spokeswoman Hannah Euser. No injuries were reported.
Farther to the north, in Ferndale, authorities say a man drowned in floodwaters while trying to get to his home where three children were trapped.
The Humboldt County Sheriff’s Office said in a statement Thursday that deputies were sent Wednesday night to a house in the town, which sits about 200 miles north of Guerneville.
The man was walking to his home from a barn in up to 5 feet of water when he was carried away by a fast-moving current, authorities said.
His body was found Thursday. The man’s name has not been made public.
Sheriff’s officials said three people tried to reach the man by driving a tractor through the floodwaters, but the machine stalled and they couldn’t get to him in time.
Deputies in a boat rescued the people on the tractor and the children from the home, authorities said.
In Sonoma County, cold, muddy brown water flowed through low-lying businesses and homes without prejudice, carrying vehicles, trees, propane tanks and all manner of large debris. Major roads were underwater, and about the only traffic came from people traversing the area by canoe.
The Russian River Valley is known for its steep coastal slopes and creeks lined by redwoods, which can rapidly funnel deluges from Pacific storms into the shallow river. Major floods hit the area in 1940, 1955, 1964, 1986 and 1995, and longtime residents are well aware they may need to evacuate with any winter storm.
When Caitlyn Meeks, 47, was house hunting five years ago in the small town of Monte Rio, which sits on a Russian River bend, the real estate agent advised her to move above the flood plain, because otherwise, her basement would flood every winter. She chose a hillside home about 60 feet above the river.
On Wednesday, she and friends sat outside on her back patio with binoculars, watching huge pieces of floating debris slam into an aging bridge spanning the river below.
“I’ve seen water coolers and propane tanks and kayaks,” she said. “I’ve seen soda syrup dispensers going down. A water heater. I can see a tree right now that’s just stuck on the Monte Rio bridge.”
In this region, she said, people are used to floods and take it as a point of pride that they’re “river folk.” On a morning walk down the hill, she saw people shouting at each other from across the swollen river, joking that they’d see each other in a few days.
“All the old-timers here are like, ‘Yep, get a bottle of wine and have some batteries ready and get ready for the show,’ ” she said.
As she spoke, Meeks yelled to her friends about what was floating by.
“A Dumpster! An actual Dumpster!”
Something slammed into the steel bridge, making a loud booming noise.
“Oh, a big tree!” she shouted. “Oh, my goodness. A huge root ball from a tree just went under.”
By Wednesday morning, Guerneville was surrounded on all sides by floodwaters, and as the water rose, the island was broken up into a series of smaller islands.
The Sonoma County Sheriff’s Office was trying to put at least one deputy on each of the bigger islands, and deputies were crossing newly developing streams by boat as needed, said Sgt. Spencer Crum, a department spokesman.
Deputies stationed in the most-beleaguered areas “have brought a change of clothes and could be positioned out there for two to three days without getting back to civilization here,” Crum said.
On River Road, one of the town’s key entryways — which authorities closed off about 10 miles outside town — portable toilets bobbed in the water surrounding an inundated barn.
Catherine Bartolomei, who has owned the Farmhouse Inn on River Road with her brother for 18 years, spent Wednesday morning relocating all of her 16 guests. She’d never had to do that before.
“The water just came up faster than we thought it was going to,” Bartolomei said.
She lamented the natural disasters that have befallen the region over the last few years, including the devastating Sonoma County wildfires in the fall of 2017.
“Between the fires and everything else, it’s flipping killing us,” she said.
Bruce Guerra, manager of Guayaki Yerba Mate Cafe in the small wine country town of Sebastopol, said water was entering the parking lot when he got to work about 6 a.m. and kept rising throughout the day.
The restaurant sits next to Highway 12, which was closed by flooding Wednesday afternoon, and was one of the only businesses open, because it is on the second floor. Guerra offered to warehouse a nearby winery’s products so they wouldn’t be ruined.
“It’s people’s livelihoods out here,” he said. “It’s a shame that this is all happening.”
The water level in the Russian River was forecast to peak about 46 feet late Wednesday, according to the National Weather Service. It can all be blamed on another river: a weather system known as an atmospheric river.
The pounding rain had stopped in Sonoma County before the sun rose Wednesday after a low-pressure system shifted the atmospheric river-fueled storm out of the region. The storm, which had lingered in the area for days, created the heaviest rainfall the region had received all winter, said Roger Gass, meteorologist with the National Weather Service in the Bay Area.
“The atmospheric river was a hose of really deep moisture pointed right at Northern California that settled over Sonoma County,” he said. “It’s created a lot of problems.”
The Russian River historically has been prone to flooding, said Barry Dugan, spokesman for the Sonoma County Water Agency. It’s described as a “flashy” river, which means it responds quickly to a lot of rain.
“When there’s a flood in Sonoma County and it’s on the Russian River, it’s usually the worst in Guerneville,” he said. The town, which is bisected by the river, sits only about 13 miles from the Pacific Ocean, and the river reaches its crest there, he said.
Two main reservoirs are situated around the Russian River, Dugan said. One was built in the 1950s and the other in the 1980s. Combined, the two reservoirs impounded 19 billion gallons of water over the last two days, Dugan said. “But with the amount of rain and water in the system we’ve seen in the last few days — there’s just too much water,” he said.
Manny Salazar, a roommate of Caitlyn Meeks, has lived in Monte Rio since 1980. The 1995 floods — to which he lost his car — sent family members packing. But Salazar, a musician, stayed because the area is so beautiful, with its redwood trees and the ocean just a few miles away.
A guitar player and singer, Salazar said he’s romantic about the area’s history. In the 1930s and 1940s, he said, paddle boats used to bring jazz musicians up the Russian River to perform.
In past floods, Salazar has seen people with shotguns perched on the town bridge, ready to shoot floating propane tanks so they didn’t explode and take out the bridge.
“This isn’t anything new to me,” he said. “You just kind of get some provisions and bunker down for a few days. You might see the Red Cross and National Guard here. All we can do is say your prayers for everybody.”

Capitol Journal: Should California insure itself against spending too much on fighting wildfires?,https://www.latimes.com/politics/la-pol-sac-skelton-wildfire-insurance-20190228-story.html,2019-02-28,"Reporting from Sacramento —This would be a first for California: state government buying insurance to protect itself against overspending its budget.
But before you start pelting the politicians and screaming fiscal irresponsibility, know that the budget-busting would be for fighting wildfires.
That puts it in an entirely different category from, say, controversial spending to help immigrants who are here illegally, or trying to register voters at the notoriously jammed DMV.
No sane person is going to gripe about overspending tax dollars to douse a deadly wildfire.
But it does amount to a sucker punch for state budgeters, who might be forced to grab money from other state programs to pay for the firefighting. Fortunately in recent years the robust California economy has been producing state revenue surpluses. So, little problem.
Another recession is a certainty, however. And so seemingly is something else: devastating wildfires worsened by climate change.
Gov. Gavin Newsom’s recent budget document contained this passage:
“Conditions in the state’s wildlands are changing rapidly…. Despite additional precipitation …vegetation remains critically dry. Weather events are more extreme, winds blow with more intensity for larger durations and humidity levels are lower for longer periods of time. Conditions historically observed in Southern California vegetation are moving north … and higher in elevation.”
The budget document also notes that 2018 “brought the largest, deadliest and most damaging fires in the state’s history…. Wildfires in California killed over 100 people, destroyed more than 22,700 structures and burned over 1.8 million acres…. Emergencies of this magnitude are becoming a more regular occurrence.”
Here’s why some leading Democrats are proposing that the state insure itself against budget-busting wildfire calamities: For the current fiscal year, the Legislature and former Gov. Jerry Brown budgeted $443 million for firefighting, and the total tab so far is $936 million. For the previous fiscal year, $427 million was budgeted and costs were $948 million.
More from George Skelton »
So three elected officials — state Sen. Bill Dodd (D-Napa), state Treasurer Fiona Ma and Insurance Commissioner Ricardo Lara — have proposed legislation that would authorize the state to buy private disaster insurance to protect it against overspending on wildfires.
Depending on the policy, if the state overspent its budget by $500 million, it might be reimbursed $400 million.
“We would use insurance to hedge against a big, bad fire season,” says Dodd, whose wine country district was devastated by wildfires in 2017. “California has never done this.”
But Oregon has. For four decades, the state has bought wildfire insurance costing $61 million and received $102 million for claims, according to backers of the California legislation.
So if the Oregon insurers lose money, why would they keep selling the policies? That answer will have to wait for another day.
The Federal Emergency Management Agency also buys policies to protect its emergency flood funds from drying up during a calamity.
Coverage of California politics »
“Most of us have house insurance, auto insurance, maybe earthquake and flood insurance,” says Ma, whose husband is a career firefighter and has battled several major wildfires. “Why doesn’t the state have disaster insurance to reduce its [financial] exposure?”
That’s a serious question legislators and the governor will need to answer.
Here are some reasons why maybe not:
Those premiums are very expensive — as high, I’m told, as 30% of the payout value. With taxes rolling into Sacramento, why not just budget more for firefighting and use the would-be premium money for extra fire prevention?
Moreover, the state already is reimbursed by the feds for its firefighting in national forests. So its budget-busting is not as severe as advertised. During the current fiscal year, $202 million is expected from Washington.
But buying insurance to protect against fiscal surprises does raise some intriguing possibilities. Maybe the state could insure itself against breaking the bank on public works — like a $77-billion bullet train that is so far projected to cost more than double the original sticker price. How about a policy to hedge against a revenue-killing recession?
Maybe citizens could even buy insurance to protect themselves against a hefty tax increase. Naw. No insurer would be foolish enough to sell that in California.
There’s also other wildfire insurance legislation percolating in Sacramento.
One bill would establish a state catastrophe fund to provide extra liability insurance for utilities. Pacific Gas & Electric Co. declared bankruptcy, fearing it could be liable for up to $30 billion for fire losses. The fund would help utilities stay afloat when they’re drowning in claims. Utilities and the state would pay into the fund.
“This would provide the utilities financial stability to keep the lights on in California,” says the author, Assemblyman Chad Mayes (R-Yucca Valley).
Another wildfire insurance bill would help burned-out victims who are underinsured or uninsured. A fund modeled after one in Florida to help hurricane victims would be created, and the state and utilities would finance it. Victims could turn to it for claims that private insurance didn’t cover.
“Communities need to be rebuilt — not just homes but small businesses,” says the author, Assemblywoman Autumn Burke (D-Marina del Rey), who recently visited the virtually incinerated Sierra foothills town of Paradise. “All you see is burned-out homes and chimneys.”
As for the state buying insurance to protect itself against breaking the budget, the politicians need to remember one thing: Both the state and the insurer can’t be winners. One will get burned.

An estimated 2,000 homes and other buildings along the Russian River in Sonoma County have flooded after days of torrential rain sent water spilling over its banks and inundated nearby communities, authorities said late Wednesday.
By Wednesday night, rescuers had saved about 40 people who were stuck in floodwaters and authorities had closed 89 roads as the river swelled to about 45 feet — 13 feet above flood stage, said Sonoma County spokeswoman Hannah Euser. No injuries were reported.
The water was expected to start receding in the early morning hours Thursday.
People living in about two dozen areasnear the river were ordered to evacuateby Sonoma County officials Tuesday in preparation for possibly the region’sworst flood in over 20 years.Officials staffed extra deputies and dispatchers to help with evacuations and field emergency calls, while two boats were deployed to the lower Russian River to get people out.
As of early Wednesday, a rain gauge northwest of the town of Guerneville had receivednearly 20.5 inches of rainin 48 hours, according to the National Weather Service. The area is known for its steep coastal mountains and creeks lined by redwoods, which can rapidly funnel deluges from Pacific storms into the shallow Russian River.
The river first exceeded flood stage — 32 feet — Tuesday evening. By early Wednesday, it had swollen to 40.5 feet, essentially turning Guerneville into an island, and continued to rise. Forecasters predicted it woule reach its highest level at 46.1 feet — more than 14 feet above flood stage — late Wednesday.
People leaving their homes watched as rising water swallowed cars and flooded major roads into and out of the community. Officials said those who chose to stay in their homes could be stuck there for days. At midday Wednesday, residents could be seen using canoes to traverse parts of River Road.
Catherine Bartolomei, co-owner of the Farmhouse Inn in Forestville, lamented the natural disasters that had befallen the region over the last couple of years, starting with devastating wildfires in Sonoma County in fall 2017.
“Between the fires and everything else, it’s flipping killing us,” she said.
Dane Pitcher, 70, watched from the third-story window of his bed and breakfast, the Raford Inn, in Healdsburg as rising water pooled to create a 100-acre lake in front of his property.
The substantial water, which swallowed up five rows of grapevines on his property, didn’t faze Pitcher. He’s seen the Russian River flood several times over the years. He joked that he had all the necessities — wine and mostly breakfast foods, given his business — to sustain him and his wife for a few days.
“We have waterfront property now,” he said lightheartedly. “We’re marooned for all intents and purposes, but that’s OK.
“For us, we’re veterans so it’s fascinating to watch, to a degree,” he added. “We’re not being inconvenienced like many people who are convinced this can’t happen or just move here and aren’t prepared. Locals like us know what to expect.”
The pounding rain had stopped in Sonoma County before the sun rose Wednesday after a low-pressure system shifted the atmospheric river-fueled storm out of the region. The storm, which lingered in the area for days, created the heaviest rainfall the region had received all winter, said Roger Gass, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service in the Bay Area.
“Theatmospheric riverwas a hose of really deep moisture pointed right at Northern California that settled over Sonoma County,” he said. “It’s created a lot of problems.”
Some areas north of the river got nearly 10 inches of rain over the course of two days. Venado, a community north of Guerneville, had received nearly 2 feet of rain in 48 hours by Tuesday.
“A lot of the rainfall in that basin flows right into the Russian River,” Gass said.
This will cause the waterway, which cuts through several Sonoma County communities, to rise over the next several hours before reaching its peak and then slowly receding on Thursday.
The Russian River has seen numerous serious floods during wet years, but this inundation is poised to be the worst since 1995, when the river crested in Guerneville at about 48 feet, exactly 16 feet above flood stage. That flood caught a number of people in the community off-guard. They fled the region in small boats, floating past debris as they sought higher ground, while others boarded huge National Guard transport trucks that drove through the floodwater to rescue people from homes.
When the river flooded more recently in Healdsburg, in 2016, Pitcher placed a sign in front of his property to show how high the water rose. The river crested at 13.22 feet that January.
“I looked out there this morning,” he said, “and that sign is completely underwater.”

California’s biggest county could severely restrict solar energy projects,https://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-san-bernardino-solar-wind-20190227-story.html,2019-02-27,"Brian Hammer thought he and his wife would retire to the abandoned Lucerne Valley farmhouse they bought nearly a decade ago in the rural high desert northeast of Los Angeles. They paid the full $55,000 asking price, then rehabbed the house themselves, stripping it down and installing new wiring, plumbing and appliances.
Now Hammer worries all that time and money were wasted.
An energy developer is planning to build a 483-acre solar farm that Hammer says would come within a few dozen feet of his house. He doesn’t want to live next to an industrial energy project, which he says would destroy the area’s rural character, fuel dust storms and harm the Mojave Desert ecology. Those are common concerns among residents of rural San Bernardino County, who have beenfighting for yearsto block large solar farms even as California ramps up its renewable energy targets.
“It’s been soul-crushing to think that our blood, sweat and tears were poured into this, and it can be taken away with the disturbance of the land,” Hammer said as he stood in the yard behind the house, trying to imagine how a field of solar panels beyond his fence would affect the 360-degree views of a valley ringed by mountains.
San Bernardino is California’s largest county by area and a hotbed for the state’s solar industry. But local officials may pump the brakes on solar this week, which developers say could disrupt ambitious climate change policies passed by state lawmakers.
The county’s Board of Supervisors is slated to vote Thursday on apolicythat would prohibit large renewable energy projects on much of the unincorporated private land governed by the county. The new restrictions would add to existing regulations that solar and wind developers say have made it difficult to build on federal land, which makes up the vast majority of the county’s 20,000 square miles.
As local residents have told the supervisors in public comments, the restrictions would protect their quality of life. Many locals say California should shift its focus from land-intensive solar farms to smaller installations on rooftops and parking lots. The National Renewable Energy Laboratory estimates that rooftop solarcould meet 74% of California’s energy needs.
“We like solar. In fact, I’m probably going to try to get some panels here at my place,” said Chuck Bell, a farmer who serves as president of the Lucerne Valley Economic Development Assn., as he drove his Ford pickup truck past a solar farm this week. “Let’s figure out how many megawatts we can produce [on rooftops and parking lots], and then figure out what do we really need to do in the California desert.”
From the solar industry’s perspective, the proposed restrictions in San Bernardino County are a case study in how local governments can make or break plans crafted in Sacramento.
Legislators passed a bill last year requiring California to get 60% of its electricity from renewable sources by 2030, and toeliminate the burning of fossil fuels for electricity by 2045. State officials also hope to put 5 million electric vehicles on the road by 2030, up from anestimated550,000 EVs that have been sold in California to date.
Those policies are meant to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases, which fuelrising seas, bigger wildfires, worsening droughts and more dangerous heat waves.
Meeting the state’s goals will require significant new solar and wind power facilities to be built, along with batteries to store that zero-carbon energy for use when the sun isn’t shining and the wind isn’t blowing.
Some of the renewable power will come from solar panels on rooftops and parking lots — starting in 2020, California will require all new homesto be built with solar power. But so far, the vast majority of California’s renewable energy has come from sprawling solar and wind farms, which are generally cheaper than rooftop solar because of the economies of scale involved.
California set a goal of 100% clean energy, and now other states may follow its lead »
San Bernardino County is crucial to the state’s climate fight because it has some of the strongest and most consistent sunlight in the world, said Shannon Eddy, executive director of the Large-scale Solar Assn., a Sacramento-based trade group.
The county is also really, really big. San Bernardino County has more land area than nine U.S. states and is twice as large as California’s next-biggest county, Inyo.
San Bernardino County wouldn’t be the first local government to restrict renewable energy production facilities. In 2016, Los Angeles County prohibited large wind turbines in unincorporated areas, including the rural high desert. Other desert counties have land-use plans thatsolar and wind developers find stifling.
“Where will California put the projects it will need to meet its clean energy goals if the counties keep saying no to solar and to wind?” Eddy asked. “San Bernardino is an emblem, but this is a broader problem across the state.”
The proposal going before county supervisors on Thursday would prohibit utility-scale renewable energy projects within the boundaries of Community Plans that have been adopted by more than a dozen unincorporated towns, including Joshua Tree, Lucerne Valley and Morongo Valley. Construction of big solar and wind farms would also be banned in so-called Rural Living zones.
A county spokesman said the proposal, known as Renewable Energy Policy 4.10, would block new solar and wind farms on slightly more than 1 million acres, out of nearly 2 million acres governed by the county. But Tim Mason, policy director for the Large-scale Solar Assn., said one solar company estimates the amount of “developable” land across the county — taking into account on-the-ground conditions and existing restrictions on federal lands — would decrease to 90,000 acres under the new policy from 360,000 acres, in a county of nearly 13 million acres.
Some locals say the proposed restrictions may not be tough enough.
Morongo Valley resident Pat Flanagan, who serves on the board of the Morongo Basin Conservation Assn., is worried developers could still ask county supervisors to carve out exceptions to the policy. She’s also not convinced solar farms should be allowed in the handful of already disturbed areas the county has previously suggested may be appropriate for large renewable energy projects.
Earlier this week, Flanagan stepped off the blacktop near Highway 247 in Lucerne Valley and crouched down to examine the salt brush scrub that dominates this part of the Mojave Desert. She was surrounded by land where the Australian construction giant Lendlease wants to build the 664-acre, 100-megawatt Calcite solar farm.
“People get away with deciding this is good for putting all this solar on because this doesn’t have spectacular plants,” said Flanagan, who has a bachelor’s degree in biology.
Soon Flanagan’s attention was drawn to a dust storm forming across the highway, at the base of the Granite Mountains. Whipped by wind, dust particles flew high into the air, making breathing more difficult as the particles approached the highway.
Like other local residents, Flanagan says existing solar projects fuel bigger dust storms because they destabilize the soil.
A Lendlease representative didn’t respond to a request for comment. A spokesman for Florida-based NextEra Energy Resources, which is developing the Ord Mountain solar project that would be built next to Hammer’s property, declined to comment.
Renewable energy has been a source of tension in California’s deserts for years, with nearly all large solar and wind projects facing opposition from unhappy local landowners, environmental groups or both. The biggest battles have been fought over potential harm to wildlife, such as birds getting sliced apart by wind turbine blades or desert tortoises and other critters losing habitat to sprawling fields of solar panels.
Although most major environmental groups support the construction of renewable energy projects in the desert, they’ve tried to steer developers toward previously disturbed lands near existing power lines.
That same mentality informed the regulators who crafted the Desert Renewable Energy Conservation Plan, an Obama-era document that protects millions of acres of California desert from the Owens Valley to the U.S.-Mexico border and sets aside smaller pockets of federal land for energy development.
Trump administration takes aim at California desert protection plan »
Energy companies have never been satisfied by the federal plan, which they say leaves too little land for solar and wind projects and adds environmental regulations that make permitting difficult even on lands designated for development. They’re also frustrated by federal leasing rules, imposed by the Obama administration, that they say have raised the costs of renting public lands for solar and wind farms.
The ongoing battle in San Bernardino County deals with county lands that are privately owned and overseen by the Board of Supervisors, rather than the federal government or incorporated cities.
Solar projects like Ord Mountain and Calcite that are already going through the permitting process would still be allowed to proceed. So even if the supervisors vote to restrict development, Hammer could still have a solar farm as a neighbor.

Beto O’Rourke proposes $5-trillion climate plan for net-zero emissions by 2050,https://www.latimes.com/politics/la-na-pol-beto-orourke-climate-change-plan-20190429-story.html,2019-04-29,"Reporting from Yosemite National Park —Beto O’Rourke, who has described climate change as the top issue of his presidential campaign, released a proposal Monday that would spend trillions of dollars to wean the country off fossil fuels with a goal to reduce net greenhouse gas emissions to zero by 2050.
The former Democratic congressman from El Paso also pledged to roll back much of President Trump’s environmental deregulation through executive order and to ramp up disaster preparedness for hurricanes, floods and other risks associated with a warming planet.
“The greatest threat we face — which will test our country, our democracy, every single one of us — is climate change,” O’Rourke said. “We have one last chance to unleash the ingenuity and political will of hundreds of millions of Americans to meet this moment before it’s too late.”
O’Rourke unveiled the plan midway through his four-day swing through California, coinciding with his visit to the Central Valley, which has been battered by drought, wildfire and flooding in recent years. On Monday morning, he toured Yosemite National Park, which closed for nearly three weeks last year because of smoke fromthe Ferguson fire, which burned nearly 100,000 acres.
O’Rourke, marveling over the vistas of Yosemite, said the national park was a symbol of the consequences of climate change, with the loss of half of its biomass in the last three years and giant sequoia trees suffering under prolonged drought. He pointed to effects on people in the Central Valley as well, noting the region’s higher asthma and infant mortality rates.
“It’s a really powerful experience,” he said, “to think of some of the oldest organisms, oldest life on the face of the planet … and then lives coming to existence right now, human life, that is compromised by what we’re doing to one another, to this planet and to sacred places like Yosemite.”
Christy Goldfuss, who chaired the Council on Environmental Quality under President Obama, said O’Rourke’s plan had similar ambition to the Green New Deal, the initiative introduced this year by some congressional Democrats that called for a massive investment to move the country away from fossil fuels.
“The Green New Deal brought to light and animated for people where we had to go. Similarly, Beto’s plan points us in the direction,” said Goldfuss, who worked with O’Rourke’s campaign on the proposal. His plan “takes it one step further and talks about how we’re going to get there, in terms of the commitment to setting dates by which we need to make sure we’re measuring our progress, and talking about exact numbers in terms of investment.”
Though O’Rourke’s plan does not include some of the more sweeping social programs of the Green New Deal, such as a jobs guarantee for every American, it is more specific in its spending prescriptions.
O’Rourke proposes $1.5 trillion in federal spending, which could then be combined with state and local dollars as well as private capital for a total $5-trillion package.
The money would go to improving infrastructure that would bring down emissions, which could involve building renewable-power desalination plants and community solar facilities.
He also would invest in clean energy research and assist communities that would be disrupted by the move away from fossil fuels with housing and transportation grants, boosts for job training and small businesses. His program would include cleaning up polluted air and water.
The plan, like the Green New Deal resolution, would aim to slash net greenhouse gas emissions to zero by 2050.
How the Green New Deal is shaping the race for president »
O’Rourke pledged to work with Congress to devise a legally enforceable standard, within his first 100 days in office, for the 2050 goal and getting halfway there by 2030.
By setting that standard, O’Rourke’s proposal said, it would send a clear message to polluters that there was a price for emitting carbon. The plan does not lay out a specific way to set that price and, therefore, to charge producers of greenhouse gas. There have generally been two policy approaches to carbon pricing: a carbon tax or a cap-and-trade system, under which polluters need to purchase permits to emit.
“If I was a politician, I wouldn’t want to lock myself into saying I’m only going to support a cap-and-trade system or only going to support a carbon tax designed in a certain way,” said Noah Kaufman, a Columbia University economist who specializes in climate policy. “It makes a lot of sense to show principles you’ll stand by but also be willing to discuss and negotiate how the details are filled in.”

O’Rourke’s plan did not earn unanimous approval in liberal circles. The Sunrise Movement, a grass-roots climate advocacy group, said the proposal was too moderate, arguing that net emissions need to be cut to zero by 2030, 20 years earlier than O’Rourke outlined.
“When did America become a country that was afraid to take on big challenges and do what’s necessary, even when we’re told it’s not possible?” said Varshini Prakash, the group’s leader.
O’Rourke, who spent Monday afternoon visiting with agricultural students, farmers and climate scientists in Modesto, pushed back on the critique.
“We’re talking about ensuring that leadership at every level, from governments to entrepreneurship to farmers and ranchers and those that produce the food and fiber upon which we depend, is brought to bear on this challenge,” O’Rourke said. “This is by far the most ambitious plan to confront climate change that we have ever seen.”
David J. Hayes, a New York University law professor who served in the Interior Department under Obama, said O’Rourke could face pushback for the $5 trillion cost of the plan, but said what he called the “T-word” was necessary in this policy conversation.
“We have to get used to the dollar [figure],” said Hayes, who consulted with the campaign on the proposal. “That’s what’s needed to decarbonize the economy.”
O’Rourke does not specify how he would pay for the initiatives; the proposal says generally they would be funded through “structural changes to the tax code” and ending tax breaks to fossil fuel companies.
Others in the Democratic field have made climate change a focal point in their individual campaigns. A number of them co-sponsored the Green New Deal, including Sens. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, Cory Booker of New Jersey, Kamala Harris of California, Kirsten Gillibrand of New York and Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota.
Another candidate and Green New Deal backer, Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, released a plan earlier this month to bar new fossil fuel leases on federal lands, which is also an element of O’Rourke’s plan.
Washington Gov. Jay Inslee has made climate change the singular focus of his presidential bid. Inslee, who unsuccessfully tried to push a carbon tax in his home state last year, has alsoembraced the net-zero emissions targetby midcentury and called for a 100% clean-energy power grid.

"Rats and other vermin infest LAPD downtown station, sparking anger among officers",https://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-rat-infestations-lapd-typhus-20190530-story.html,2019-05-30,"When state officials inspected the Los Angeles Police Department’s Central Division station last November, they uncovered rodent infestations and other unsanitary conditions at the facilities responsible for protecting skid row and other parts of downtown.
The conditions have now become the source of growing anger inside the station, with some officers threatening to seek transfers and city leaders scrambling to address the problems.
The issues at the Central Division come amid larger concerns about disease and filth across downtown, notably a vermin infestation at City Hall last year. One city employee was diagnosed with typhus, a disease that can be spread by rodents. City Hall workers said they saw fleas, rodent droppings and plants eaten by vermin in the building.
The California Department of Industrial Relations issued six violations and a $5,425 fine to the LAPD on May 14 and two violations and a $1,910 fine to the Department of General Services, records reviewed by The Times on Thursday show.
On Thursday, Mayor Eric Garcetti and the LAPD said they are working to resolve the problems. The division has 414 sworn officers — the largest number in the city.
“Our officers work hard every day to protect our city, and they deserve the best working conditions,” said Alex Comisar, a Garcetti spokesman. “Whether the issue is bad plumbing or something else, the mayor is working with the department to get to the bottom of this situation — and will take every possible step to protect the health and safety of all our employees.”
The department added: “The state’s report is concerning and we are taking steps to ensure the men and women who work for the Los Angeles Police Department can come to work in a healthy environment.”
The LAPD announced late Wednesday that anemployee who fell ill at the downtown LAPD station had contracted the strain of bacteria that causes typhoid feverand was being treated for the condition. The LAPD confirmed that a second employee had a lower intestinal infection, but a specific diagnosis has not been determined.
It’s unclear where the officers contracted typhoid, though officials said they were not patrol officers. The LAPD appeared to link the case to officers’ work conditions, saying in a statement that “our police officers often patrol in adverse environments and can be exposed to various dangerous elements.”
Yet several experts said it was highly unlikely the the officer contracted typhoid on the job or even in the country, where the spread of typhoid is rare. The filthy conditions that the LAPD was cited for aren’t related to the spread of typhoid, experts say.
“It would be very important to know what the travel history is for the past six to eight weeks,” Dr. Robert Winters, an infectious disease doctor who runs a travel clinic in Santa Monica, said of the sick LAPD officer. “It’s not something you worry about going to Starbucks or McDonald’s.”
Two police sources said officers are considering taking a hard stance and filing paperwork to transfer from the station. One concern, the sources said, was that some officers reported getting sick from chemicals used to kill fleas, said the sources, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to comment publicly.
Among the violations at the station on East 6th Street, according to the state, was that the LAPD did not train employees about how the dangerous bacterial disease typhus is transmitted, its symptoms or measures for prevention. The department also did not have a program to exterminate and control rats, fleas, roaches, gnats, mosquitoes or grasshoppers in the building. Inspectors found all those in the facility, records show.
Other state violations came from failing to clean “dust, dirt/suspect mold/fungus from the HVAC registers within a reasonable time”; for using extension cords instead of fixing wiring in the detectives area; and for not keeping the parking garages, stairwells and records room clean, according to the citations.
The state fined the Department of General Services for not maintaining the building. The department submitted an appeal to the state Tuesday. A statement from the department said it has addressed some issues and routinely conducts pest control activities and provides daily cleaning services.
The board of directors for the Los Angeles Police Protective League, the police labor union, said “officers worry enough about being shot or injured policing the streets of Los Angeles” and shouldn’t fear taking home infectious diseases.
Robert Harris, a union director, called the conditions “pretty disgusting” in the Central Division headquarters and called on the city to hire outside experts to craft a plan to sanitize all police facilities.
“We’re trying to be a proactive partner to clean up these toxic work sites,” Harris said. “Let’s clean it up before we have a massive outbreak.”
Still, it is even more challenging for the city to keep downtown disease free with the thousands of homeless living on the streets. The areas with large homeless populations have major effects on public health, said Dr. Neha Nanda, epidemiologist at Keck School of Medicine at USC.
Typhus, in particular, is spread by fleas that live on rats and then bite humans, something that could become more common as more people live on the streets.
Thirteen people in the state were diagnosed with typhus in 2008, compared with 167 last year. More than 95% of the people falling sick in California are in Los Angeles and Orange counties, according to state health data.
In October, L.A. County officials declared an outbreak of typhus linked to overcrowding in downtown L.A. around skid row. A major outbreak of Hepatitis A in San Diego linked to homelessness killed 20 people two years ago.
Nanda said that growing homeless populations often create unsanitary conditions that contribute to the spread of disease, even some “that are coming back from the historic times.”
Typhoid too is linked to unsanitary conditions, as it is transmitted through water and food contaminated with fecal matter, Nanda said.
So far this year, the L.A. County Department of Public Health has received reports of five cases of typhoid, according to officials. Last year, there were 14 cases of typhoid fever in the county, they said. Most cases occur in people who traveled to countries where the disease is common, they said.
“It’s not seen that often, but if we follow that theory — that homelessness is increasing — and we see the surges of Hepatitis A and typhus and all these things, why not typhoid?” Nanda said. “How much can our infrastructure take?”

"With summer here, expect the fires to follow",https://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-fires-california-update-20190628-story.html,2019-06-28,"Summer finally arrived in Southern California this weekend with temperatures in the 90s and a series of small fires around the region.
Firefighters were able to put out the fires — including one near Dodger Stadium and another in the San Gabriel Mountains — fairly quickly. But officials say this is just beginning.
Significant rainfallbrought an increase in grasses, and as those dry out during what’s expected to be a hotter-than-normal summer, lower elevations will be vulnerable. Much like last year, the greatest fire potential will occur from October through December, experts say, as theSanta Ana windspick up.
Officials are expecting numerous grass fires of between 5 and 150 acres to burn during June.Several spot fires have already broken outacross the state, according to the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection.
But those burn areas are expected to nearly double in July — to around 250 acres — and balloon to 1,500 to 5,000 acres by September and October. Like last year, the worst could come in November, when experts warn that fires of more than 5,000 acres could break out.
Last year, the state was ravaged by monster conflagrations during the first week in November. TheWoolsey firekilled at least four people, blackening more than 96,000 acres and destroyed more than 1,100 structures. Thedevastating Camp firewiped out the town of Paradise, killing 85 people and destroying more than 18,000 structures as it torched some 150,000 acres.
“As the summer progresses into the fall months, the potential for devastating fire increases until we get rainfall,” Los Angeles County Fire Chief Daryl Osby said during a news conference at the Pomona Fairplex.
Fire officials from more than a dozen agencies throughout the state, including Cal Fire, the Governor’s Office of Emergency Services, the U.S. Forest Service, the Orange County Fire Authority and the Ventura County Fire Department, were on hand to outline what the state is likely to face this year as fire season gets underway.
Officials can’t say for certain whether this year will be theworst for fire in state history, but they are encouraging residents to be vigilant and proactive.
“I’m not here to proclaim the sky is falling. Instead, I’m here to tell you it will,” Ventura County Fire Chief Mark Lorenzen said, emphasizing that the last two fire seasons serve as evidence for what could happen.
Last year,Ventura County firefighterswere trying to contain the Hill fire between Thousand Oaks and Camarillo when the Woolsey fire began steadily growing in the hills of Thousand Oaks before jumping to Malibu. The fire would become one of the most destructive — and expensive — in Los Angeles County, withhome losses topping $1.6 billion.
“I’m not here to proclaim the sky is falling. Instead, I’m here to tell you it will.”
— Ventura County Fire Chief Mark Lorenzen
“Whatever happened in Malibu could happen in San Gabriel with the right fuel conditions,” said Mike Takeshita, the acting division chief of the L.A. County Fire Department’s forestry division.
After the deadly Camp firerevealed glaring shortcomings in municipal evacuation plans, Cal Fire conducted a risk assessment that found an estimated 11 million residents — or 1 in 4 Californians —live in areas considered to be athigh riskof a wildfire.
“I anticipate there’s a whole lot of people in suburban Southern California, and, frankly, in the Bay Area, that would never consider themselves a part of that ‘1 out of 4 Californians that live in a fire risk area,’ but they actually do,” said Wade Crowfoot, head of the California Natural Resources Agency.
The state’s current wildfire-fighting strategy relies heavily on altering forestland and creating firebreaks. Firefighters say there are currently active prescribed burns in the Angeles National Forest but not elsewhere in L.A. County.
But environmental advocates and others say that fire safety “starts from the home outward.”
Officials recommend that residents clear brush within a 100-foot radius of residences and do any yard work in the early morning before temperatures get warm and dry. Those using metal blades should keep a suppressor, such as a shovel, nearby in the event of a spark.
For those who live in areas without easy access to alternative roads or emergency routes, Lorenzen recommended that residents have personal belongings at the ready in the event of an evacuation.
“When we tell you to go, it’s time to go,” he said. “The last thing we want is a loss of life.”
While L.A. County Fire Department is the largest in the state, thousands of resources — including personnel and fire engines — are shared across California to assist during wildfires, considered by officials to be the greatest threat to life and property in the state.
Residents are encouraged to contact their local fire agencies with questions and use the “Ready Set, Go” programthrough the L.A. County Fire Department’s website to assess their fire readiness.
Even the state’s highest office is warning of the potential danger of this year’s fire season. Gov. Gavin Newsom recently told a gathering of emergency managers to “prepare for the worst.”
“We just can’t take this anymore,” Newsom said. “The state can’t take 2018 again. Can’t do 2017. … We can’t take it anymore.”
Times staff writers Louis Sahagun and Joseph Serna contributed to this report.

Body of missing McFarland city manager found in Kern River,https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2019-07-31/body-of-missing-mcfarland-city-manager-found-in-kern-river,2019-08-01,"The body of missing McFarland City Manager John Wooner was found this week inside a vehicle submerged in the Kern River, authorities confirmed Wednesday.
Wooner, 57, was last seen alive May 14 at Hillcrest Memorial Park, a cemetery in Bakersfield.
Sgt. James Nabors of the California Highway Patrol’s Bakersfield office said Wooner was traveling in a silver Dodge Durango on Highway 178, a winding two-lane canyon road, in an area full of rocks and boulders when, for unknown reasons, the vehicle exited the roadway in an area without guardrails.
“We don’t know if it was a deliberate act, if it was accidental, if it was mechanical or if it was DUI-related,” Nabors said. “None of those are known at this time.”
The vehicle had moss on it and had been in the river for “quite some time,” although the exact time frame is unknown, Nabors said.
The Bakersfield Police Department had previously offered a $5,000 reward for information on Wooner’s location.
Angela Monroe, a public information officer with the Kern County Sheriff’s Office, said the coroner’s office has not yet determined a cause of death.

Russian military called in to fight Siberian forest fires,https://www.latimes.com/world-nation/story/2019-07-31/russian-military-called-in-to-fight-siberian-forest-fires,2019-08-01,"MOSCOW —The Russian military on Wednesday joined efforts to fight forest fires that have engulfed nearly 11,600 square miles of territory in Siberia and the Russian Far East — an area the size of Belgium.
The move, which includes sending military transport planes and helicopters that can drop water on fires, came after an order from Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Russian authorities have declared a state of emergency in five areas, including all of the Irkutsk and Krasnoyarsk regions, which lie north of Mongolia. Siberia’s Krasnoyarsk region, which stretches all the way to the Kara Sea and the Arctic Ocean, can be seen blanketed by smoke in satellite photos from NASA and Europe’s Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service.
No injuries or evacuations have been reported so far from the fires, many of which appear to have been started by lightning strikes in “dry thunderstorms” in which precipitation disperses before reaching the ground.
But the fires, which were being spread by strong winds, have produced heavy smoke that has clogged the air in several cities, including Novosibirsk, Russia’s third-largest city with a population of 1.6 million in southwestern Siberia.
Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev visited the city of Krasnoyarsk on Wednesday and gave a glum assessment of the forest fires.
“The situation is difficult. Many forests are burning, smog and smoke are observed over many populated areas. The prognosis at this moment is not happy,” he said.
Russia’s agency for aerial forest protection, Avialesookhrana, said that about 2,700 firefighters were working to put out the blazes but that about 10,800 square miles of the fires were in difficult-to-reach areas. Those forest fires, it said, were not being fought because the costs and risks of doing so were greater than the potential damage the fires could cause to unpopulated areas.
Russia’s vast stretches of forest have often been hit by widespread fires in the summer months. This year, however, the world experiencedthe warmest Juneon record.
“It’s not for the first time that we’re having this catastrophe in our country,” said Mikhail Kreindlin, a Greenpeace activist in Moscow. “Why there is so much attention to it this year is because the smoke from the fires has reached the cities, with activists who [have] started to raise the issue.”
Protests demanding action against the heavy smoke from the fires were planned for Thursday in Moscow outside the Ecology Ministry. Greenpeace also planned to submit a petition with more than 200,000 signatures to the Russian government urging a better response to wildfires and more preventive action.

PG&E rebuts WSJ story that linked power line upgrade delays to Camp fire,https://www.latimes.com/business/story/2019-07-31/pge-rebuts-wall-street-journal-story-about-power-line-upgrades,2019-07-31,"PG&E Corp. told a judge it “strongly disagrees” witha Wall Street Journal storysuggesting that the utility knew its equipment near the ignition point of California’s deadliest wildfire badly needed upgrades and nonetheless deferred maintenance.
The company’s response, filed Wednesday, was ordered this month by a federal judge who demanded a “fresh, forthright statement owning up to” the accuracy of the article.
The utility is under criminal investigation in Butte County over the deadliest fire in the state’s history. The Camp fire, which raged in the northern part of the state for two weeks in November, killed 85 people,destroyed the town of Paradiseand promptedPacific Gas & Electric to file for bankruptcy.The California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection concluded that the utility’s equipmentcaused the Camp fire.
In the rebuttal to the Journal article provided to the judge, PG&E acknowledged that it had proposed replacing 60 towers on the line that runs through Butte County where the fire started. But the company said that was for work required to meet federal standards and that the scope of the project didn’t target the particular transmission tower where the power line failed and the fire started. It also said that from 2014 to 2017, only a small portion of the fires caused by the utility were sparked by transmission lines.
A Wall Street Journal spokesman said the newspaper is reviewing the filing.
U.S. District Judge William Alsup has said PG&E’s failure to cut and trim vegetation and branches was a cause of some fires in Northern California in 2017 and 2018. He is overseeing the company’s probation after it was convicted in 2016 of safety violations stemming from a 2010 gas line explosion in San Bruno, Calif., that killed eight people.
Alsup’s July 10 order also cited an ABC News report about recent political campaign contributions and demanded that the company disclose the full amounts and recipients of the donations. He also demanded an explanation as to why $5 billion in dividend payments took precedence over managing vegetation that posed a fire threat.
PG&E said in 2017 and 2018 that it made political contributions of $5.3 million, paid for by shareholders and not money from customers.
Responding to Alsup’s concerns about dividend payments, the utility said revenue from customers isn’t sufficient to support operations and infrastructure. PG&E needs to issue dividend payments to raise money from capital markets, it said.
“Dividends facilitate investment in infrastructure, because the steady payment of dividends is essential to raising new capital from investors,” PG&E said.
According to the Journal article, a year before the Camp fire, PG&E conceded to a lawyer for California that it needed to undertake many projects to prevent failures of its power transmission system and that it knew parts were outmoded.
Related to the Camp fire specifically, “the company knew that 49 of the steel towers that carry the electrical line that failed needed to be replaced entirely,” the Journal reported. The utility only started detailed inspections of transmission lines after the fire, according to the article.
PG&E had delayed replacement of the towers on the line for a variety of reasons including “engineering, operational and permitting” issues, the utility said in its filing. The company said it needed to replace the towers to comply with federal clearance standards for its lines and the work wasn’t ”to identify and repair or replace worn or broken parts.”
PG&E also denied that it began close inspections of its transmission lines only after the Camp fire, saying in the filing that it conducted ground inspections of overhead lines at least every five years and aerial patrols every year when a detailed inspection wasn’t done.

"Tucker fire grows to 14,000 acres, becoming largest blaze in California this year",https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2019-07-30/tucker-fire-acres-largest-wildfire-modoc-national-forest-2019,2019-07-30,"TheTucker firein Modoc County has burned  more than 14,000 acres with 10% reported containment, making it the largest wildfire in California so far this year, officials said Tuesday.
Officials withCal Fireand the U.S. Forest Service said the fire started in rural northeastern California on Sunday afternoon off California Highway 139 and Tucker Butte Road, about six miles southwest of Clear Lake Reservoir. The fire, which is believed to have been caused unintentionally by humans, grew 10,000 acres in one day. The latest reported acreage of the blaze is 14,419, making it the biggest active fire burning in the state and the largest in California so far in 2019.
No homes are threatened and no evacuations have been ordered as of Tuesday afternoon, but affected residents in the County Road 114/202, Coyote Butte, Horse Mountain area have been issued a warning that they will be contacted if an evacuation is necessary.
The U.S. Forest Service said in an update that the fire didn’t burn as erratically Tuesday as it had over the past few days. Fire crews have worked on fire-line construction and provided point protection for infrastructure in the fire area Monday while aiming to protect the Clear Lake National Wildlife Refuge and local wildlife habitats. California Incident Management Team 10 has also been ordered and is expected to take over fire-suppression management starting Wednesday, officials said.
Warm, dry conditions driving increased wildfire activity on National Forest lands in California. The#TuckerFireis our largest of the yearhttps://t.co/7fRLJFEvwghttps://t.co/VuaOJ0Yk06
Ken Sandusky, a public information officer with the U.S. Forest Service, said that wildfires in the Modoc National Forest are at their most challenging when flames reach areas that have not been treated with fire-fuel reduction efforts, includingjuniper reduction.
He said that because wildfires have long been a healthy, key part of the land’s ecological processes, including by Native Americans as a land-management tool, fire crews have seen success in areas where encroaching juniper was removed with controlled, low-level fire. This is because when a wildfire is burning up against such areas, firefighters are better able to use that land to help manage and control the blaze.
When a wildfire is burning through areas that have not been treated, the situation is far more dangerous and harder to control, Sandusky said.
“We cannot emphasize enough how much benefit we get in situations like these when we’re able to have previously treated the area affected. It’s just a night-and-day difference,” Sandusky said.

Summer finally arrived in Southern California this weekend with temperatures in the 90s and a series of small fires around the region.
So far this year, fires have burned more than 37,472 acres of land in California, perCal Fire. The Tucker fire also comes after the Goose 2 and Rainbow fires, which were also suspected by officials to have been unintentionally caused by humans and burned in Modoc County earlier this year. Before the Tucker fire, the Goose 2 fire identified on July 17 was the most recent and was 100% contained at 128 acres.
The 2019 fire season follows California’sdeadliestandmost destructivewildfires in 2017 and 2018. The U.S. Forest Service asks residents and visitors in fire-prone areas tofollow safety precautionsby making sure campfires are fully extinguished before leaving them unattended, never disposing of a cigarette in an area where it could start a fire and never bringing fireworks into any national forest.

"Labor Day weekend weather: Scorching in the valleys, perfect at the beach",https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2019-08-31/labor-day-weekend-weather-scorching-in-the-valleys-perfect-at-the-beach,2019-08-31,"Labor Day weekend is shaping up to be perfect for a Southern California beach excursion, with coastal temperatures expected to be in the mid-70s to 80s.
But if you’re in the valley areas, you might want to save your holiday barbecue for late afternoon or evening.
Highs for the Antelope Valley are forecast to be as high as 108 degrees. The National Weather Service has issued anexcessive heat watchfor Sunday, when temperatures are expected to peak.
The San Fernando and San Gabriel valleys will top out at 95 to 105 degrees on Sunday, according to forecasters. Aheat advisoryfor those areas cautions people to drink plenty of fluids, stay in air-conditioned rooms and out of the sun, and check up on relatives and neighbors.
“Just be real careful and aware about how you’re feeling,” said David Sweet, a weather service meteorologist. “Don’t expose yourself to heat for a long period of time.”
Because of the hot, dry conditions, the wildfire risk will also be elevated, Sweet said.
The heat is likely to persist after the holiday, Sweet said. Early fall in Southern California can be very warm, with hot Santa Ana winds in October, he said.

Brush fire in Malibu near PCH is 95% contained,https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2019-08-30/firefighters-respond-to-malibu-brush-fire,2019-08-30,"Firefighters were battling a 40-acre brush fire in Malibu on Friday, assisted by retardant and water-dropping aircraft as they worked quickly to set perimeters around homes in the surrounding area.
The Sweetwater fire  burned about 40 acres, officials said. By 3:30 p.m. it was 95% contained, officials said.
L.A. County spokesperson Marvin Lim said there was no more risk of fire.
Nearly 200 firefighters and three helicopters were dispatched to the scene off Sweetwater Canyon Road near Pacific Coast Highway about 11:30 a.m., said Marvin Lim, a spokesman for the L.A. County Fire Department. The Los Angeles Fire Department deployed a fourth helicopter.
Sweetwater Road was shut down as firefighters were battling the fire on all fronts, Lim said.
No structures were threatened and no evacuations  were ordered, he said. Winds were light, blowing at about 10 mph and humidity levels were in the double digits,  helping firefighters in containing the fast-growing brush fire, said Capt. Tony Imbrenda, a spokesman for the county Fire Department.
Reports of a second fire nearby are unconfirmed. Lim said firefighters believe smoke from the Sweetwater fire may be giving the appearance of a second fire near 2100 Stunt Road.
The fire put the Malibu community on edge.It is still recovering from the 97,000-acre Woosley fire last fall. That blaze destroyed more than 1,500 structures and killed three people.
Praying for you,#malibu. Fires are back 😢pic.twitter.com/sGu1nkNdYI
It may be difficult for those not here to understand how anxious#Malibu(and really all of California) about the upcoming hot and dry weather after last year’s devastating#Woolseyfireand#campfire
On Friday afternoon, Malibu Mayor Jefferson “Zuma Jay” Wagner was at his surf shop watching fire trucks roll into the area.
The Sweetwater fire, he said, was about 500 yards from his surf shop at 22775 Pacific Coast Highway but was moving away from structures, instead chewing through light and medium brush and some chaparral.
Wagner said he wasn’t too concerned about this fire because it is currently terrain driven.
“It’s not wind driven, and there are a lot of air resources on the spot right now,” Wagner said. “I’m starting to see the boots on the ground show up in huge numbers. We have camp crews showing up. I saw four or five trucks, and I’m seeing engines from all the outlying areas.”
The Los Angeles Fire Department meanwhile battled another blaze in the Hollywood Hills. At about 1:30 p.m., that fire was burning 1/4 of an acre of grass uphill. The fire grew to less than half an acre and was contained 30 minutes later.

California’s wildfires revealed a fix for our housing crisis — if we’re willing to act,https://www.latimes.com/opinion/story/2019-08-29/skinner-housing-california-senate-bill-330,2019-08-30,"The destructive fires that roared through California over the last two years have displaced tens of thousands of people, creating a humanitarian crisis as well as a housing crisis. One of those fires provided valuable lessons on how to solve emergency housing shortages in the state — theTubbs firethat ravaged the city of Santa Rosa and Sonoma County in 2017.
City and county officials treated the aftermath of the Tubbs fire as the crisis it was. In the months after the blaze, theyimplemented programsto expedite the rebuilding of thousands of homes. Santa Rosa reduced the fees the city levies on high-density, multifamily housing and on accessory dwelling units often called granny cottages. And instead of taking years to issue rebuilding permits, the city processed thousands each month. Sonoma County also waived some housing fees and opened a Resiliency Permit Center to speed up permitting for those dealing with fire damage.
Their approach inspired me to introduce Senate Bill 330, which I call the Housing Crisis Act of 2019. The bill would accelerate housing construction in the state during the next half-decade by slashing the time it takes for developers to get building permits, limiting fees on housing and barring local governments from reducing the number of homes that can be built.
While California’s statewide housing shortage was not caused by wildfire, it’s still a humanitarian crisis — one of our own making. The fact that we have failed to build enough housing to keep up with the state’s population and job growth has led to the highest rents and home ownership costs in the nation.
California nowranks 49th in the nationin housing units per capita. The extreme scarcity of housing has made renting or buying a home prohibitive for many. Themedian home priceis more than $610,000, and 33 of the 50 U.S. cities with the highest rents are in California. Nearly a third of California rentersspend more than halfof their incomes on rent.
The housing crisis has also led to a crisis in homelessness. California is now home to a quarter of the nation’s homeless people. On any given night,about 130,000 people are living on our streets, a 10% increase since 2016. Nearly half of the homeless population lives in Los Angeles County.
SB 330 is based on the premise that much of the housing we need has already been planned for by our local communities. California cities and counties have approved zoning for 2.8 million new housing units, according toa 2019 report by UCLA Lewis Center for Regional Policy Studies. Under current zoning rules, Los Angeles County alone has the potential to build 567,040 new units.
But the housing is not being built. Almost20% fewer residential building permitswere approved in the first six months of 2019 compared with the same period a year ago. There are many reasons for the home-building slowdown, including soaring costs of construction and materials and labor shortages.
Recent studies have also pointed out two other problems: Cities and counties often levy burdensome fees that can reach $50,000 per unit on housing projects, and developers can face delays of up to four years after they submit their applications to build housing.
Local government fees on housing in Californiaare three times the national average, according to a 2018 study by UC Berkeley’s Terner Center for Housing Innovation. A later Terner Center report also found that cities and counties often do not reveal the total amount of fees that housing project applicants must pay until months or years after a proposal is submitted, a problem that can threaten a project’s viability.
Earlier this year, a UC Berkeley Law School reportexamined how long it took for multi-unit housing projects to obtain approvalin Los Angeles, Long Beach, Pasadena and Santa Monica over a three-year period. The time frames ranged from more than 10 months in Long Beach to more than 48 months in Santa Monica. Lengthy delays often kill housing projects because costs increase and projects no longer pencil out.
SB 330 is designed to help California communities swiftly build much of the housing the state needs without altering local zoning rules. Until 2025, cities and counties would have to slash the time it takes to process housing applications to no more than 90 days for most market-rate housing projects and to 60 days for affordable ones after a project application is deemed complete and it complies with local zoning rules. The bill also limits the number of public hearings on a project to five. In addition, cities and counties would be barred from hiking fees after the project applicant has submitted all preliminary required information.
For five years from the time the bill becomes law, urban areas throughout California would be prohibited from changing design standards for how housing should look, reducing the number of housing units allowed, establishing a cap on the number of people who can live in a community, or implementing a moratorium on new housing construction.
The bill also includes anti-displacement measures, including a ban on the demolition of affordable and rent-controlled units unless developers replace all of them and pay to rehouse tenants and offer them first right of return at the same rent.
SB 330 is scheduled to be heard by the Assembly Appropriations Committee on Friday. If approved in committee, it would go to the full Assembly for consideration next week.
Gov. Gavin Newsom has called for building 3.5 million new units of housing in California by 2025. The Housing Crisis Act would help us get there.

Cal Fire plans to rip out vegetation in San Diego County. But will that add fuel to a blaze?,https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2019-09-30/cal-fires-plan-to-rip-out-vegetation-in-san-diego-county,2019-09-30,"Highly flammable nonnative plants have increasingly played a major role in Southern California’s struggles with wildfire — providing kindling along roadsides and around homes that turns sparks into menacing backcountry blazes.
San Diego County firefighting officials plan to dramatically ramp up efforts to rip out vegetation, both native and invasive, surrounding remote communities as part of a statewide campaign to prevent tragedies such as the Camp fire in Paradise, Calif.
However, environmental groups and scientists are now warning that brush removal projects may actually exacerbate the risk of fire by inadvertently helping to spread invasive grasses such as black mustard, star thistle and ripgut grass.
San Diego County’s ambitious goal is to clear 5,000 acres a year using prescribed burns and chainsaws, while also ramping up maintenance of trails and remote roads accessed by firetrucks.
Critics say the plan is ill-conceived and seeks to bypass environmental reviews that could force authorities to address the spread of invasive plants.
“They just released a new strategy plan. Not a word in there about this situation,” said Rick Halsey, director of the San Diego-based California Chaparral Institute. “Once again, they want to expedite environmental procedures so they can go out there and clear habitat.”
Officials with the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection, known as Cal Fire, did not respond to repeated requests for comment.
County officials downplayed the notion that invasive grasses could be playing an outsize role in wildfire.
“From a fire standpoint, County Fire/Cal Fire San Diego Unit is concerned about any vegetation that can potentially contribute to the spread of wildfire,” county spokeswoman Tammy Glenn said in an email. “Non-native annual grasses have historically been a part of California’s grasslands since their introduction during Euro-American settlement centuries ago.”
To illustrate his concerns, Halsey drove along Highway 78 on Wednesday to the rolling hills between Escondido and Ramona in San Diego County. There, large swaths of countryside were burned in the 2007 Witch fire, with some sections scorched again by smaller blazes in following years.
As a result of the fires, Halsey said, invasive plants have proliferated. Indeed, grasses turned golden brown in the late summer heat flowed over many of the slopes, interrupted only by sparse patches of green, native chaparral, such as chamise and laurel sumac.
“This is just too much fire for this spot,” he said, “so you’ve lost a lot of biodiversity. Plus you have a much more flammable situation. There’s going to be another fire here in 10 years.”
This same pattern will likely play out in many of the areas where Cal Fire wants to clear out brush and use prescribed burns, Halsey argued.
Chaparral and sage scrub include what are known as fire-adapted species, meaning wildfire is essential for the health of the plants. But the fire regimes of invasive grasses, Halsey said, are different than those of native plants, burning more frequently, faster and at lower temperatures.
As the head of the Chaparral Institute, his opposition is strongly informed by a mission to protect native chaparral and coastal sage scrub habitat, which provide habitat for everything from gnat-catchers to trapdoor spiders.
However, scientists have also come to similar conclusions about the spread of invasive grasses and the role they’re playing in spreading wildfire.
“It’s the never-ending cycle where the more [invasive plants] burn, the more you have, the less you have of everything else, the more frequent and unpredictable your fires become,” said Travis Bean, UC Cooperative Extension weed science specialist based at UC Riverside. “It quickly gets out of control.”
More than 90% of wildfires are caused by people, most often when they come into contact with the edges of forests and wildlands.
Bean said that this recipe for disaster most frequently plays out along roadsides lined with invasive grasses, where sparks, cigarette butts and other potential ignition sources from vehicles can easily bring catastrophic results.
“It’s like we drizzle all our roadsides with just a little bit of lighter fluid,” he said. “If we don’t manage them, the fire’s going to get off the roadside and into that chaparral, climb up that hill and get into that multimillion-dollar housing development.”
The catch for those engaged in brush management is that once you alter an ecosystem, whether by building a road or creating fuel breaks for firefighters, routine upkeep becomes essential in order to keep invasive plants from taking over, Bean said.
“Once you perturb the system,” he said, “it’s going to be a constant annual, sometimes more than annual, maintenance scenario that now should be considered a part of your budget forever. Otherwise, in the luckiest-case scenario the native chaparral grows back. More likely, it’s going to get invaded by these easily ignited species.”
Even more likely is a situation where there is a mix of invasive grasses and the more hardy native bushes, Bean said. “That can be even worse because you get that quick flash of ignition from the fine fuels and the heat retention and staying power of the chaparral species.”
“It’s like we drizzle all our roadsides with just a little bit of lighter fluid.”
— Travis Bean, UC Cooperative Extension weed science specialist based at UC Riverside
County officials said that they revisit treated areas every three to five years.
“This ensures that the breaks continue to serve their intended purpose,” said county spokeswoman Glenn. “Fuel breaks act as a buffer against the spread of wildfires, helping to protect nearby communities, including critical infrastructure and sensitive habitats.”
California kicked off its campaign to more aggressively prune back forests and scrublands this summer. Gov. Gavin Newsom waived the environmental review for 35 so-called fuel management projects across the state.
In San Diego County, Cal Fire cut down large swaths of vegetation around the communities of Crest and Guatay. Firefighters cut 200-foot-wide fuel breaks around homes on nearly 190 acres.
At the time, Cal Fire officials said they were selectively leaving some of the native plants in place.
Sabrina Drill, natural resources advisor for Los Angeles and Ventura counties for the University of California Cooperative Extension, said that grooming natural landscapes can, to a certain extent, help firefighters when battling blazes.
“I think there is a need to have established and maintained fire roads,” she said. “Fuel breaks around developed areas can be somewhat effective.”
Specifically, she said, cutting back brush around homes can give firefighters staging from which to protect communities. However, she said, if those areas aren’t regularly groomed, brush removal projects can lead to even more flammable conditions.
“I might suggest coming back in and spraying in future years when those annual grasses come in,” she said. “There needs to be a commitment, and it needs to be at least annual.”

Some L.A. officials want a state of emergency declared as homelessness crisis worsens,https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2019-09-29/homeless-emergency-declaration-california-gavin-newsom-shelter-encampment,2019-09-30,"Facing a deepening quagmire over homeless encampments, Los Angeles elected officials are increasingly looking to sweeping statewide initiatives to shake loose solutions. The latest proposal from Los Angeles County Supervisor Mark Ridley-Thomas and City Councilman Joe Buscaino would have the governor declare a state of emergency on homelessness in California.
Supporters view such a declaration as a novel strategy to free up state and federal funding typically reserved for natural disasters, such as earthquakes or wildfires, and to suspend or streamline the regulatory hurdles that often slow down shelter and housing development. It also could block NIMBY opponents from using environmental reviews to sue and delay or block homeless facilities from opening.
But some question whether an emergency declaration would be merely symbolic, given President Trump’s rejections of more federal funding and Gov. Gavin Newsom’s commitment of $1 billion for local homeless programs and support for more regulatory relief.
Last week, Newsom signed a package of legislation that, among other things,exempts from environmental reviewsupportive housing and shelter projects in the city of L.A. that receive funding from certain public sources, including the $1.2-billion Proposition HHH housing bond measure that voters approved in 2016.
Another new law allows cities in Alameda and Orange counties, in addition to the city of San Jose, to declare a shelter crisis so those local governments can eventually bypass some planning and zoning regulations to expedite construction.
“The governor should not sign a declaration of emergency until the proponents identify the specific laws and regulations they want to get around, and the resources they believe the declaration would free up,” said Gary Blasi, a retired law professor who specializes in homelessness issues. “The state statutes regarding emergencies were not designed to respond to long-standing political, leadership and moral disasters.”
Newsom has not taken a stand on the current request for a state of emergency declaration, and Alex Comisar, spokesman for Mayor Eric Garcetti, said it was “a choice for the governor to make.”
“There are more questions that need to be worked through before he could support something like that,” Newsom spokesman Nathan Click said.
In 2015, City Council members and Garcetti announced that they would declare an emergency locally, but then dropped the idea as the mayor sought a statewide declaration from then-Gov. Jerry Brown, who turned him down.
Then in 2018, Los Angeles declareda shelter crisis, which, along with a legislative change, triggered streamlining of red tape around developing emergency beds on public land.
Many in Los Angeles have been frustrated by the sluggish pace of construction of new shelters and housing for the estimated 44,000 residents in the county, including 27,000 in the city, who live outdoors in tents, cars or lean-tos, as opposed to shelters or other temporary housing. Only 477 emergency shelter beds have been added in the last 2½ years for households without children, which form the bulk of the homeless population, according to an inventory released this month.
Buscaino said he had grown particularly frustrated that even temporary tent shelters on public land had become bogged down in multiple approval processes.
“We’re stopping for every red light, instead of treating this like an emergency,” Buscaino said.
Before a meeting Friday of thegovernor’s task force on homelessness, headed by Ridley-Thomas and Sacramento Mayor Darrell Steinberg, Newsom, in a letter, asked members to prioritize getting people off the streets.
He underscored that local communities must “fully enforce” public safety and health laws, touching on the controversial issue of sanitation sweeps of encampments and other police enforcement. He also asked the task force for proposals to break down barriers to building housing and to get more homeless people into treatment.
Steinberg and Ridley-Thomas arechampioning a legal right to shelter for California, which would require local governments to provide a bed to every homeless person who wants to move indoors. Steinberg also wants to require homeless people to accept shelter if offered, although how that would be enforced remains a question.
Separately, several local governments — including the city and county of L.A. — and business groups also arepetitioning the U.S. Supreme Courtto hear a challenge to a federal appeals court ruling out of Boise, Idaho, that has stopped authorities in Western states from arresting homeless people for sleeping in public when shelter space is unavailable.
“We have a tacit public policy it’s OK to live outdoors,” Steinberg said. “I am strongly pushing for a clear public policy that says as a matter of right people should be living under a roof.”
Newsom has said he isnot ready to endorse a legal right to shelter.
“What the governor has said is it’s urgent, let’s get started,” Ridley-Thomas said. “I don’t think anything is dead.”
Before the meeting in Willowbrook on Friday, Ridley-Thomas and Steinberg insisted they were not backing off. But Steinberg repeatedly emphasized that he preferred that people be placed in permanent housing, not a vast shelter system, which critics say could blow the state’s budget without ending homelessness.
“The hard reality is that the governor has already done most of what would be done if a state of emergency was to be called,” said Philip Mangano, the former federal homelessness czar in the George W. Bush and Obama administrations and a member of the governor’s task force. “The governor is the homelessness czar in California and the task force’s job is to give him big ideas to make a difference.”
Homelessness emergency declarations in other parts of the U.S. have a mixed record. Hawaii has issued multiple declarations, the last one in 2018, that have allowed the state to suspend permitting and site restrictions, shaving one to two years off shelter and housing projects, said Scott Morishige, the governor’s coordinator on homelessness.
State homeless numbers overall dropped last year, but the number of unsheltered people on Oahu rose 12%. An emergency declaration “is not a silver bullet by any means,” Morishige said.
In Oregon, Portland and the surrounding Multnomah County used an emergency declaration to relax occupancy rules and zoning for homeless projects.
“Shelters were set up in weeks instead of months or longer,” said Denis Theriault, spokesman for the office of homeless services for Portland and the county.
Theriault said the local homelessness budget also doubled, to $70 million over five years. In January, Multnomah County’s homeless count showed a decline of 4% from 2014, but the number of people living in tents or cars and under bridges was up 22% from the year before.
In California, Steinberg said, what is most important is stating a clear public policy that it is not OK for tens of thousands of people to be living outdoors.
“Everybody has a right to live under a roof — preferably in permanent housing, if necessary in navigation centers,” he said. “It starts with that acknowledgment.”

"Utilities are shutting down power amid fire danger, but the DWP keeps the lights on. Should it?",https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2019-10-31/la-getty-fire-dwp-policy,2019-11-01,"When strong winds hit California, utility companies increasingly cut power to neighborhoods across the state to try to reduce the threat of wildfires. This week alone, Pacific Gas & Electric and Southern California Edison  blacked out tens of thousands of homes as historic winds struck.
But in Los Angeles, the Department of Water and Power continues to keep the switch on, permitting electricity to course through its 6,000 miles of power lines, even when the fire threat grows.
The long-held policy could come under increasing scrutiny, however, as fire seasons grow longer and damage tolls keep rising. This week’s blaze near the Getty Center, for some residents, was reason enough to re-evaluate the approach.
California
Red-flag warnings have been extended for the windiest spots of L.A. and Ventura counties, but the unusually long Santa Ana wind event is expected to ease. No rain is in the forecast, though.
One of the utility’s power lines along the 405 Freeway was believed to have been struck by a dried eucalyptus tree branch that broke off during high winds, according to the DWP. Sparks from the electrified line ignited a brush fire that eventually destroyed 12 homes and forced thousands of residents to evacuate, officials said.
DWP officials said there was no failure of electrical equipment and that utility crews had cleared the area of vegetation in July, as required by fire safety codes.
Despite the preparation, blazes around the 405 Freeway can halt traffic and upend the city’s Westside. The Getty fire took place in an area designated by the state as an “elevated high-fire zone,” according to utility officials. Nearly 30% of Los Angeles’ land area falls within the zone, officials said.
The utility, officials said, does not shut off service to customers during a high-wind event, in part because the utility serves an urban area where the fire risk is lower and because firefighters can rapidly respond to any blaze.
Turning off power in a densely populated city such as Los Angeles presents its own set of issues, affecting everything from traffic lights to hospitals, said DWP general manager Marty Adams.
California
Forecasters have labeled Santa Ana winds expected Tuesday and Wednesday an “extreme red flag,” warning — a rare term underscoring the potential danger.
“You’re talking about essentially handicapping the city from functioning,” Adams said. “Do you put major parts of the city out of power, which means putting people out of business?”
Instead, the utility’s fire management plan include pruning vegetation around its equipment. DWP officials said the eucalyptus was more than 30 feet from the power pole, beyond the area that the utility is  required to clear.
The city’s fire department supports the DWP policy of not shutting off power, said LAFD spokesman Peter Sanders.
As for the property where the  branch snapped off, Sanders wrote in an email that the land appears to be owned by C and C MountainGate Inc. Representatives of the MountainGate Country Club golf course, which is  near the Getty along the 405 Freeway and was closed this week because of  the fire, were not available for comment.
Los Angeles City Councilman Paul Koretz, whose district includes the hillside neighborhoods of Bel-Air and Beverly Crest, plans to introduce a motion that would ask the city to study whether it should ground power lines in fire-prone areas, his spokeswoman Alison Simard said.

Red-flag warnings in California signal a dry, windy environment ripe for rapid fire growth
Gregg Landis, who manages the Bel Air Glen Homeowners Assn., supports burying power lines. But in in the short term, he said, the DWP should look at turning off power in areas that have burned before, such as the Sepulveda Pass. Landis said most inconveniences would be manageable if neighborhoods have advance notice. “It’s a day or two” without power, he added.
Across California, the power shut-downs have been met with a mix of anger and grim acceptance, as utility  officials weigh the risks of exposure posed by each high-wind event.
Anticipating strong winds, San Diego Gas & Electric turned off power this week to some of its 3.6 million customers. Most of those affected live in rural areas, but the blackouts also extended to populous communities including Encinitas and Rancho Santa Fe, said utility spokeswoman Ashley Bernhardt.
SDG&E has de-energized lines since 2013, and is recognized by the state as a leader in performing targeted outages. Those outages focus on shutting down the distribution lines that serve neighborhoods facing safety risks, a practice that allows electricity to keep flowing to some customers while turning off power to others on the same circuit.
However, the ownership structure of a utility can guide policy-making. SDG&E, Edison and PG&E are investor-owned utilities and are solely in charge of their liability costs. The DWP is part of Los Angeles city, putting residents on the hook for potential fire costs. “If the DWP was a private company, it would face different decisions,” Adams said.
California
PG&E could shut off power to 605,000 customers Tuesday and Wednesday. Southern California Edison could shut off power to more than 350,000 customers.
Under state law, utilities must pay for damages to homes and property if its power equipment causes a fire, even if there was no negligence on the part of the utility.
The DWP has wildfire insurance, but its premiums have risen 20% in the last few years, a “cost that directly affects our ratepayers,” Adams said. However, he added that other utilities have seen steeper jumps in insurance costs.
In one of the most-high-profile incidents, DWP’s insurers paid out $100 million after the 2013 Powerhouse fire near Santa Clarita, a utility spokeswoman said. That blaze started near DWP equipment and lasted more than a week, destroying dozens of structures, burning more than 30,000 acres and prompting lawsuits. A spokeswoman said the DWP admitted no liability in the fire.
Barbara Broide, president of the Westwood South of Santa Monica Boulevard Homeowners Assn.,  donned a paper mask to do yardwork this week as the hillsides around the Getty Center smoldered.
Targeted blackouts in L..A’s fire-prone hillsides probably make sense, Broide said, but she worried that widespread outages would shut down traffic lights and home security systems. “It’s just not practical to turn off power in huge swaths of the city,” she said.

"Fear is big business: This store sells protection from fires, earthquakes, shooters and more",https://www.latimes.com/business/story/2019-10-31/disaster-emergency-preparedness-spending,2019-10-31,"Attorney Arezou Diarian thought she was ready for anything.
The 49-year-old mother of two had stocked her home’s bedroom closets with emergency kits, each capable of sustaining a family of four for three days should a fire, earthquake or other calamity strike. Diarian had first aid supplies and search-and-rescue equipment. There were particulate respirators and air filters to protect against air fouled by smoke and chemicals.
Then she visitedSOS Survival Products, a low-slung, windowless cinder-block building utterly lacking in curb appeal. There, Diarian found out her preparations weren’t nearly good enough.
“I’m going to get an emergency kit for my office,” she said. “I bought a seat-belt cutter and car window breaker and pepper spray. I bought a crowbar, and I bought another first aid kit for my car.”
In a modest industrial section of Van Nuys, SOS owner Jeff Edelstein caters to the fear of the day.
Wildfires? He’s got eight kinds of filtration masks and multiple types of preassembled backpack kits to grab and go.
Earthquake? He’ll show customers how to store enough water for a week or more and to secure furniture and cabinets.
Power outage? He’s got a solar-powered generator that can run a CPAP breathing machine overnight. There are bigger generators too, with training in proper operation to avoid carbon-monoxide poisoning.
In need of temporary shelter? He has tents, cots, bedding, portable toilets and pop-up privacy shelters.
Edelstein, 51, has been in the emergency preparedness business since 1989, the year of the deadly Loma Prieta earthquake in Northern California, immortalized by a seismic image on the store’s wall. Edelstein started out selling supplies in his father’s Westchester hardware store and later opened his own place peddling protection and peace of mind.
To inject a little lightheartedness into an otherwise grim enterprise, Edelstein displays Zombie Survival Kits containing “the necessary items to sustain one person for two days of survival during an apocalypse or any type of disaster.” After all, surviving any emergency requires food, water, shelter, sanitation facilities and the ability to render first aid.
Diarian wasn’t fazed by the zombie references, but some items stopped her cold, such as the classroom lockdown kits for active shooter emergencies.
Each kit, in a black five-gallon bucket, includes a portable toilet, wipes, vinyl gloves, duct tape, cat litter for absorbing messes and a tarp for privacy. “In the end, it’s an item no school should be without,” said the ad for the product.
“That was disheartening,” Diarian said. “But it also made me feel good to know that people are realizing that this is the reality we now live in, and we just need to be prepared.”
Disaster worries among individuals, schools, businesses and government agencies are driving a surge in spending to prepare for and react to global emergencies. The worldwide market for such products and services was $75.5 billion in 2017 and is predicted to increase to $423 billion by 2025, according to research firm Allied Market Research.
The report cited a rise in the need for “safety and security solutions, owing to increases in natural calamities and terrorist attacks, implementation of regulatory policies for public safety and the necessity of emergency preparedness.”
From 1980 through 2018, the U.S. endured an annual average of 6.3 weather or climate-related disasters that caused at least $1 billion in damages, adjusted for inflation, according to the Commerce Department’s National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. So far in 2019, there have been 10 such events, NOAA said.
InCalifornia, wildfirestorched more than 1.2 million acres in 2017 and 1.6 million acres in 2018, according to the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection and the U.S. Forest Service.
This year’s preventive power outages to avoid fires started by utility equipment have affected millions of customers.
Thenumber of active shooter incidentsrose to 30 in 2017 and 27 in 2018 from 21 or fewer in each of the previous six years, the FBI reports.
Increases in the frequency and severity of man-made and natural disasters has created a kind of collective global unease, experts say.
“We are learning to think about the unthinkable. This is the opposite of complacency, and that should be the motto for this day and age,” saidNaj Meshkati, a USC professorof civil and environmental engineering, industrial systems engineering and international relations. Meshkati has traveled extensively to study disaster sites such as Japan’sFukushima Daiichipower plant, which was severely damaged in 2011 by a magnitude 9 earthquake and subsequent tsunami.
“Both the natural and man-made disasters of the recent past have exceeded our expectations,” Meshkati said. “It is not safe to settle for what you have done.”
SOS Survival Products isn’t alone in its mission. Most hardware retailers, military surplus stores and camping equipment sellers carry some of what Edelstein does.
Such merchants tend to get a boost right after an earthquake or wildfire or on the anniversary of a disaster. At times like that, Edelstein will add a few employees to his regular roster of 14.
But SOS also draws a regular clientele that wants to be well supplied for the end of the world as we know it. Some longtime customers, who were reluctant to be interviewed or give their full names, said they could survive on their own for a month or longer after a disaster, and they’re not inclined to share.
“I don’t want anyone else knowing how many supplies we have,” said a U.S. Navy veteran who would identify himself only as Joe. “I’m not doing this to save everyone in the neighborhood.”
Among SOS’ customers is the 10,000-student Redondo Beach Unified School District. Preparing for the possibility of emergencies, such as an intruder with a gun, has been one of the most challenging tasks that schools Supt. Stephen E. Keller said he has faced.
“I have struggled a bit as a leader because this was not my forte,” Keller said. “But we are diligent, relentless and open-minded about the threats that could be out there.”
Edelstein’s father and grandfather both ran traditional hardware stores, making his survival products store a kind of third-generation affair.
“I grew up around hardware stores. I loved the smell of them,” Edelstein said. As early as 11 years old, he said, “I could tell you about any of the products in my dad’s store.”
For many years, Edelstein said, SOS Survival Products “was all about natural disasters, earthquake kits or emergency kits. We always sold supplies to schools, like a classroom kit for teachers. So, if there was a disaster, they had items that they could use to keep their kids safe.”
Most people don’t spend enough time preparing for an emergency, and once an event such as a quake recedes in memory, the concerns are forgotten, Edelstein said.
“First panic sets in, and then they want to buy everything and anything that’s available. That’s exactly what happened after we had the 7.1 earthquake on July 5th in the Ridgecrest area of California,” Edelstein said.
“We had people coming into the store bringing old emergency kits that they purchased after the Northridge earthquake in 1994,” Edelstein said. “Items that had a five-year shelf life that expired more than 20 years ago.”
Edelstein’s business conducts classes, most of which are free, on topics such as basic emergency preparedness or surviving active shooter incidents. Classes listed on the company website include how to operate two-way radios and emergency power options during electrical grid shutdowns.
“We’ve been able to train thousands of people through the store to be better prepared before the next disaster,” Edelstein said. “It’s not a sales pitch. It’s informative, using past disasters and examples of different things that have happened to give people ideas of how to prepare themselves for an earthquake, or fire or whatever the case may be.”
Under severe fluorescent lighting, Diarian wandered through the no-frills 1,500-square-foot store, which resembles a 1950s hardware store for survivalists. Attached is a more than 12,000-square-foot warehouse with even more survival products.
Edelstein advised her to place a bag under each bed in the household with “just your absolute essentials”: a flashlight, shoes, an extra set of clothes, light sticks, a whistle to signal for help, a pair of gloves and a crowbar to pry open windows or doors that are stuck after an earthquake.
Edelstein said he tells customers to have at least a week’s worth of supplies and to stock more canned goods than freeze-dried food because so-called MREs, or meals ready to eat, require water, which cuts into what might already be an inadequate amount for drinking.
“I definitely need more food, and I need more water,” Diarian said, “and when the cans get older, I’m going to swap them out and replenish them with new cans and just try to stay on top of it.”
Fear is a powerful motivator.
“Never would I have anticipated a lot of the things happening in our country,” Edelstein said. “When I first started, I thought, ‘Oh, we’ll make some different kits and we’ll sell them to different hardware stores.’ And then, we started working with school districts, cities. Over 5,000 different items later, we’re still adding and expanding.”

No rain in sight for L.A. area for next few weeks; critical fire weather warnings extended,https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2019-10-31/no-rain-in-sight-for-l-a-area-next-few-weeks-keeping-fire-danger-high,2019-10-31,"The unusually long Santa Ana wind event is expected to ease Thursday evening. And with it, the fire risk will be reduced as well.
But there is not much good news on the horizon, with forecasters seeing little chance of rain in the next few weeks.
Critical fire weather warnings have been extended through Friday night for the windiest spots of Los Angeles and Ventura counties,continuing red-flag conditionsfor an additional 24 hours. The red-flag warnings, which sound the alarm for high winds, dry air and parched vegetation, will persist for inland mountains and valleys in Los Angeles and Ventura counties and the Santa Clarita Valley because of ongoing winds from the northeast and very dry air. Other areas were expected to see red-flag warnings expire as gusts ease Thursday evening to 25 mph to 35 mph.
California
Heavy concentrations of smoke pollution plagued an area from Santa Monica to Long Beach early Thursday. Friday morning may bring a similar pattern.
Top wind gusts recorded Thursday were still strong — 67 mph in a Ventura County coastal valley, the National Weather Service reported, not much weaker than a peak recorded Wednesday of 78 mph at Boney Peak in the Santa Monica Mountains. The air is still bone dry, with relative humidity levels in Simi Valley, the site of the fire that threatened the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library, at 8% Thursday.
Gusts of up to 54 mph were recorded close to the Cajon Pass, near where the Hillside fire in San Bernardino spread Thursday morning. At Riverside Municipal Airport, gusts of 25 mph to 30 mph were recorded near a fire in Jurupa Valley, said Jimmy Taeger, meteorologist with the National Weather Service office in San Diego.
When fire weather risks will drop
Red-flag warnings were expected to end for the less windy locations of Southern California by Thursday at 6 p.m.. A powerful mass of cold, high-pressure air over the Rocky Mountains that’s sending supercharged winds to California is expected to weaken, reducing the winds in the south.
Elevated fire danger could persist through the weekend, said meteorologist Lisa Phillips of the National Weather Service’s Oxnard office, even after red-flag warnings expire.
“Luckily, we are not seeing any more Santa Ana winds within the next week,” Phillips said.
Why California has been hit with strong winds
This Santa Ana wind event was fueled by an unusually strong mass of cold, high-pressure air parked over the Rocky Mountains and the Great Basin over Nevada and Utah; on Thursday, a record low of negative 14 degrees was recorded in Randolph in northern Utah, breaking a 28-year-old record low of minus 1 degree in 1991.
That cold air mass dropped in from the Arctic to the Rockies because there’s such a big mass of high pressure over Alaska, which has been seeing record warmth on a recurring basis and where there is effectively no sea ice on the Arctic Ocean coast in October for the first time in recorded history. That warm mass of air over Alaska had the effect of placing the cold air over the Rockies — creating an extreme contrast in temperatures that sends supercharged dry winds closer to the California coast.
The expected 30-hour “extreme red-flag” warning largely arrived according to expectations, said Daniel Swain, climatologist with UCLA and the National Center for Atmospheric Research.
No signs of rain in early November
Through mid-November, there are no clear signs of rain anywhere in the forecast for California, Swain said. And the less rain California sees at the traditional start of the rainy season, statistically, the more likely it is that the entire wet season will be below average, Swain said.
Still, “a dry autumn doesn’t necessarily portend a dry winter,” Swain said. “We’ll have to take the seasons as they come.”
Though October and November are not California’s rainiest months — the rains in the winter are typically the wettest — they’re arguably especially important because, when they hit, they reduce the fire weather risk from strong, dry Santa Ana and Diablo winds coming from Nevada and Utah toward the Pacific Ocean, Swain said.
Southern California hasn’t had significant rains in seven months, said climatologist Bill Patzert.
Santa Ana wind event a little less severe than expected
The good news, though, is that the difference in air pressure between the coast, measured at Los Angeles International Airport, and inland areas, recorded at the community of Daggett in the San Bernardino County desert, was less severe than expected. A lower difference in air pressure between the coast and the high desert generally leads to a less severe Santa Ana wind event.
Instead a reading of perhaps negative 10 millibars, the air-pressure difference came in at a more modest negative 9.3 millibars, the weather service said.
That “may have made the difference between a historic event than just a severe, strong one,” Swain said, sparing Southern California from widespread damage that can happen with extremely strong events. “They did cause some damage, but not the widespread damage that you can see during these extreme events sometimes.”
The Thomas fire, which killed two people and destroyed more than 1,000 structures in Ventura and Santa Barbara counties in one of California’s most destructive wildfires on record, ignited and spread during a two-week red-flag event in Southern California from Dec. 3 to Dec. 17, 2017.
This week’s extreme red-flag warning was longer than normal — about 30 hours. Though it was shorter than the 2017 event, “our conditions were drier than they were before the Thomas fire,” said Phillips of the weather service’s Oxnard office.

"Wildfire smoke hovers, then clears, over Southern California. Expect more of the same Friday",https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2019-10-31/smoke-southern-california-wildfires-pollution,2019-10-31,"Smoke from multiple wildfires hung over much of Southern California on Thursday, blanketing the region with hazy brown vistas and pungent, ashy air and prompting health warnings from air quality officials.
Because of morning  wind patterns, some of the highest levels of fine-particle pollution, or wildfire soot, hovered over a coastal area that normally has relatively clean air — the communities that stretch from Santa Monica to Long Beach. That changed later in the day.
The South Coast Air Quality Management District issued a smoke advisory spanning much of Los Angeles, Orange, Riverside and San Bernardino counties. Officials predicted smoke and ash to produce pollution levels that are “unhealthy for sensitive groups,” including children, the elderly and people with preexisting health problems. Air pollution could potentially reach higher levels in areas directly downwind from fires, the advisory noted.
Among the areas where officials expect poor air quality through Friday morning:
Air quality in the “moderate” range was widespread Thursday morning as winds blew from the north and northeast, pushing smoke south and southwest across Los Angeles County. Pollution reached levels that are“unhealthy for sensitive groups” along parts of the coast, including Long Beach and the South Bay.
But with winds predicted to shift to come from the west and southwest Thursday afternoon until sunset, the smoke could move back east and northeast across the Los Angeles Basin.
Elevated pollution levels are expected again in the early morning hours Friday.
Pollution tends to be worst in the early morning, when weather conditions cause wildfire smoke to hug close to the ground. Webcam imagery showed smoke from the Hill and 46 fires hovering near the ground in the Riverside and Chino Valley areas Thursday morning, according to the air district.
Wildfire smoke can irritate the eyes, nose and throat, trigger asthma attacks and raise the risk of heart attacks and stroke. Tiny, harmful particles in the smoke can lodge deep in the lungs and pose serious health risks, especially to children, the elderly and people with lung diseases.
The districtupdates air quality conditions, maps and pollution readings hourly online.

Whittier church destroyed in predawn blaze,https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2019-10-31/fire-erupts-at-whittier-church-cause-unknown,2019-10-31,"Aswildfires ravaged the Southlandon Thursday, an unrelated blaze erupted before dawn at a church in Whittier, destroying the large two-story structure.
The fire at Good Shepherd Bible Church at 6712 Washington Ave. started about 5:05 a.m. and quickly spread throughout the building, sending flames shooting through the rooftop.
One person was transported to the hospital as firefighters used ladder trucks and hoses to battle the fire, Los Angeles County Fire Department officials said.
The blaze, which is under investigation but did not appear to be related to any of the numerous brush fires burning across Southern California, tore through the backside of the church, leaving a burned outline behind. Inside, a collapsed pile of charred wood was seen blocking the main entrance.
The church, which sits across the street from a city park, has been in the Gamboa family for 30 years. According to its website, Pastor Sam Gamboa Jr. and his wife, Sharon, took over from Gamboa’s father and mother. KTLA-TV Channel 5 reported that the campus houses two churches, one that has been in the community for nearly a decade.
Gamboa grew up in the church, flexing musical talent at a young age as a singer.
“Pastor Sam recalls, ‘They would put a chair behind the pulpit so that I could stand on it to be seen,’” the website says. Over time, he took on the tambourine, drums and piano for the choir. His interest in teaching ministry started at age 16. In 2002, he  became a pastor for Good Shepherd.
A representative of the church was not immediately available for comment Thursday. An adult Bible study class had been scheduled to meet on the evening of the fire.
One church member told KTLA she had been in the building Wednesday night and rushed to the site Thursday morning after learning of the fire.
“I needed to see the building,” she said. “It’s been home to us for so long and for so many people. It just hurts.”
Fire officials said a cause for the blaze has not yet been determined.

How do wildfires get their names?,https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2019-10-31/how-are-wildfires-named,2019-10-31,"Their names are seared into the collective consciousness of California: The Griffith Park fire of 1933. The Bel-Air fire of 1961. The Tunnel fire of 1991. The Camp fire of 2018.
Spurred by high winds, low humidity and an abundance of fuel, California’s most destructive fires remake its cities and scorch its wildlands.
When the fires rage, their names are all around us. They’re hashtagged on our Twitter feeds. They scroll along the bottom of our television screens. They are plastered in giant letters across the front pages of our newspapers.
And long after the smoke has cleared, their names endure — a reminder of the drama and tragedy of the West’s wildfire story.
“Names are more memorable than numbers, so we should be grateful that the practice started early and has continued,” saidStephen Pyne, a fire historian and emeritus professor at Arizona State University. “If a fire was known as LAFD-1961-57, nobody would care.”
How do these fires get their names? Who decides?
Fires are named almost the instant they are reported, said Scott McLean, a spokesperson for theCalifornia Department of Forestry and Fire Protection, also known as Cal Fire. The decision is usually made by the dispatcher who takes the call. Less frequently, fires are named by the first responder to reach the scene.
After receiving a report of fire, dispatchers quickly plug its coordinates into a map and look for a nearby feature to use as a moniker. A geologic landmark like a valley, river or canyon will work. So will the name of a road.
“The name helps direct us to the location,” McLean said. “We respond to about 170 fires a week throughout the state. We don’t have time to second-guess ourselves. We get a location and a name, and then we get to work.”
Most fire agencies in California stick to a single word when naming a fire. That’s why the deadliest conflagration of 2018 was known as theCamp fire, not the Camp Creek fire. When a blaze broke out near Old Waterman Canyon Road in San Bernardino in 2003, it was dubbed, simply, theOld fire.
The ominous-soundingWitch fireof 2007 in San Diego County was named for Witch Creek Canyon in Santa Ysabel, where the first spark ignited. TheRattlesnake fireof 1953 got its handle because it was burning through Rattlesnake Canyon in the Mendocino National Forest when it was first reported.
The names can be evocative, even poetic. Or not.
“It’s not my position to say, but I would give the dispatchers a character count rather than making them stick to a single word,” Pyne said. “It would help the public. With one-word fires you can get really klutzy names.”
When Pyne worked for the National Park Service putting out fires near the Grand Canyon in the 1960s and ’70s, the labeling of fires in the wilderness was a free-for-all.
“We named after girlfriends, we named after incidents that occurred during the fire, we indulged in wordplay — all of which made us feel more attached to the fires and their stories,” he said.
That would not fly at most agencies that respond to fire today.
In 2012, theNational Interagency Fire Centerin Boise, Idaho, issued amemodetailing best practices for fire-naming conventions and protocols.
NIFC advised against naming fires after people, private properties or companies. It said no fire’s name should ever include the words “dead man” or “deadman.” It said naming fires after previous catastrophic fires was frowned upon. And under no circumstances should anyone succumb to the temptation to use a “cute” name like Cross fire, Sure fire or Cease fire.
“What may be funny to one person or group may not be to another,” NIFC officials wrote.
Yet even with these warnings in place, unfortunate fire names are bound to happen. A fire that broke out in Simi Valley on Wednesday was named theEasy firebecause it started on the corner of Easy Street and Madera Road. In view of the fire’s strength,some media outletsreferred to it as the “so-called Easy fire.”
In 2015, an emergency crew member in Idaho responding to the 57th fire of the season at 3 a.m. on an August morning gave up trying to come up with a meaningful moniker and named it theNot Creative fire.
Occasionally, fires occur at the same location over and over, and so they get numbered.
In Idaho, where there are lots of Sheep Creeks and Deer Points, there are also multiple Sheep Creek fires and Deer Point fires, said NIFC spokeswoman Carrie Bilbao.
“Sometimes the call comes in and the dispatcher will have to say, ‘We already had a Deer Creek fire this year, so they’ll have to call it Deer Creek 2,’” she said.
RedZone, a Boulder, Colo., company that provides fire intelligence and analysis, recently examined the names in its national wildfire database and found that the same ones were indeed used over and over again. All together, it counted 28 Cottonwood fires, 24 Canyon fires and 24 Bear fires between the years 1895 and 2010.
These issues don’t come up with hurricanes, which have avery strict naming systemimposed by theWorld Meteorological Organization. The centerpiece is a predetermined list of male and female names which are used on a six-year rotation. The only exceptions occur when a previous storm with the same name was so destructive that it would be inappropriate to use the future.
McLean said he prefers the way fires get named.
“I think hurricanes need more creative names, but that’s just me,” he said.
Ultimately the name of a fire, like the name of a rock band, provides little indication of its power and reach.
“A great fire can have a fatuous name,” Pyne said, while “a dazzling name can’t make a great fire.”
In the end, “the name gives it a useful handle, but it’s the fire’s story that matters.”

"Fire stopped after crossing Mexican border east of San Diego, Cal Fire says",https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2019-10-31/fire-south-of-otay-mountain-mexico,2019-10-31,"SAN DIEGO —A fire that began south of the U.S.-Mexico border late Wednesday night had grown and consumed 50 acres on the U.S. side by Thursday morning before being stopped, authorities said.
“Fire activity north of the border has decreased significantly allowing firefighters to make significant progress,”Cal Fire San Diego tweetedjust after 6 a.m.
Cal Fire crews responding to a report of flames on the south side of Otay Mountain about 10:30 p.m. Wednesday arrived to find the fire burning south of the border, according to a series of tweets from the agency.
“The fire is approximately 5 acres and entirely within Mexico,” Cal Fire San Diegotweeted before midnight.
“Engines will remain at scene to monitor into the evening,” the agency said in another tweet.
The blaze broke out amid a busy night for fire crews on both sides of the border.
Around 6:20 p.m., a blaze erupted in Tijuana’s La Sierra neighborhood,destroying six homesand damaging at least four others before Tijuana firefighters were able to halt the flames.
#CopperFirenear Otay Mtn [update] The fire is approximately 5 acres and entirely within Mexico.
Around 8:20 p.m., a firescorched about a half-acre of vegetationin an overgrown patch of southeastern National City near Chula Vista, authorities said.
That fire ignited in an undeveloped riverbed area known for its homeless encampments, according to a National City Fire Department battalion chief.

California fires will result in higher insurance rates for homeowners,https://www.latimes.com/business/story/2019-10-31/fire-insurance-david-lazarus-column,2019-10-31,"Vida Hamadani was hit twice this week by the Getty fire. As a Brentwood resident, she was forced to evacuate from her house and move in with her son.
As an independent insurance broker, she’s been fielding calls from clients asking what’s going to happen to their rates.
“It’s not good,” Hamadani, 67, told me. “I tell them rates are going to skyrocket. I have a lot of unhappy clients.”
This year’s fire damage to California properties  has been modest compared to last year’s catastrophic loss of  nearly 19,000 homes, resulting in more than $12 billion in insurance claims.
But the trend is clear: Things aren’t getting any better — and thanks to climate change andour eagerness to buildin areas susceptible to wildfire, the situation almost certainly will grow worse. That means the cost to homeowners for coverage will keep rising.
Mark Sektnan, vice president of the American Property Casualty Insurance Assn., didn’t want to say that so bluntly, regardless of how many time I rephrased the question.
But he acknowledged that, for many homeowners, rates are going up. In some cases, that can mean a doubling or even a tripling of premiums.
“Insurers will continue to reflect risk in their rates,” Sektnan said. “As risk increases, so will rates.”
He noted that “we’ve had three historically bad years for wildfires. Rates going forward have to reflect past losses.”
Michael Soller, a spokesman for the state Department of Insurance, said his office has heard reports of rates tripling for some homeowners. “We’re really concerned about that,” he said.
In July, Gov. Gavin Newsom signed into law a bill —AB 1054— that creates a fund of at least $21 billion to address wildfire costs. “The rise in catastrophic wildfires fueled by climate change is a direct threat to Californians,” he said at the time.
Most of that cash will be used to assist utilities in dealing with claims related to blazes started by their equipment. That may keep utility rates from soaring, but will do little for insurance premiums.
The cost of coverage is rising not just because fire danger statewide is growing but also because some insurers have stopped writing new homeowner policies, especially in high-risk areas, such as canyons.
“Companies are constantly trying to understand what their risk is,” Sektnan said.
And they’re acting accordingly. That’s understandable from a business perspective. And bad news for people whose homes may be in harm’s way.
One proposal making the rounds is rate reductions for homeowners who take steps to mitigate fire danger, such as clearing brush around their property. This is the same basic idea as lowering health-insurance costs for people who don’t smoke or drink, or who exercise regularly.
Consumer Watchdog, a Los Angeles advocacy group, wrotean open letterto state Insurance Commissioner Ricardo Lara in August calling on him to crack down on runaway rates.
“Homeowners insurance companies are imposing extreme rate hikes and abruptly non-renewing homeowners who live in areas at higher risk for wildfires, even when they do everything in their power to mitigate fire hazards and harden their homes,” said Carmen Balber, the group’s executive director.
“Homeowners should not lose the ability to insure their homes when they do all the right things to protect themselves and their property from fires,” she said.
Lara, the insurance commissioner, told me he’s “working on solutions to address the crisis of rising insurance costs and policy non-renewals.” He added that “we need the Legislature to engage with us.”
Homeowners in high-risk areas who can’t find coverage on the open market may have to turn to a state-sponsored program called theCalifornia FAIR plan. FAIR covers up to $1.5 million for a structure and its contents, which in some cases won’t be enough for full replacement of a lost home and property.
Sektnan said there’s been an uptick in the number of people turning to the FAIR plan. But he said many people stay in the program for just a few months, until they can find more comprehensive coverage elsewhere.
If nothing else, the current fires serve as a reminder for all California homeowners to make sure their coverage is up to date. Contact your insurance agent to confirm that the estimated replacement cost for your house reflects current market conditions.
Pro tip: Ask about whether you’re covered not just for fire damage but also for damage caused by smoke or ash blowing from elsewhere. Some insurers deny such claims.
You might also consider paying a little more for what’s known as an extended replacement cost endorsement. This is an add-on to your policy that will cover at least a portion of unexpected cost increases in the event you have to rebuild.
It’s a near-certainty that labor costs, as well as prices for materials such as wood and cement, will surge after a devastating blaze.
You can also purchase additional coverage for code upgrades — for example, if the rules have changed for electrical systems, plumbing or insulation since your house was built. Such “betterments,” in insurance lingo, might not be covered by your existing policy.
Whether you’re a homeowner or a renter, take your smartphone and walk around your home shooting a video of your belongings. This can be very helpful if an insurer balks at, say, replacing a top-of-the-line computer or home-theater setup.
If you have to evacuate, save all receipts. Many homeowners policies include so-called ALE coverage, as in “additional living expenses,” which will include costs such as hotel rooms, food and rentals.
Bottom line: Being a homeowner in the Golden State means assuming a risk your neighborhood will burn down.
That risk is growing.

"Days of terrifying darkness, cold and hunger amid PG&E’s sweeping power blackouts",https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2019-10-31/california-power-outage-darkness-cold-and-fear,2019-10-31,"CLEARLAKE, Calif. —For four nights, Eliana Rubin cared for her newborn son, James, by candlelight.
The baby, 11 weeks old, is her first. He’s colicky and wakes often, she said. As the latest Pacific Gas & Electric safety shut-off dragged on this week, she lighted  a flame by her bedside each time the child woke, but was careful to blow it out before falling asleep again. Even more than the dark, she worried about the near-freezing temperatures inside her home in this remote part of Northern California.
“The thing is the cold,” she said Tuesday. “I am, like, folding him under the blankets.”
Amid what was effectively the longest planned power shut-off in California, the toll of the blackout — both immediate and existential — took shape Wednesday for PG&E customers who have weathered back-to-back outages, lasting up to five days for nearly half a million people.
In Lake County, which shares a border with Napa County but lacks its wealth, that has meant fear, cold, hunger and often anger — directed at both the utility and state leaders. More than 90% of PG&E customers in this landlocked county of lonely foothills lost power beginning Saturday evening with little idea when it would flow again.
Despite attempts to prepare after a shorter outage earlier this month, the duration of the blackout frayed both tempers and order. Gas tanks were siphoned, and generators “are like diamonds,” said one resident. Cellphones are still sporadic; news remains mostly word of mouth.
Unsure whether Pacific Gas & Electric would keep a promise to restore power by evening, County Administrative Officer Carol Huchingson said Wednesday afternoon she was considering openingemergency shelters for medically fragile residentswho have been pushed “completely around the bend.” Worry that outages are the new normal has been replaced by insistence that they cannot be.
“It’s insane,” Huchingson said. “It’s horrible and just totally unacceptable.”
When deep darkness took over by 7 p.m. in the scattered towns around Clear Lake, the largest freshwater lake in the state, there was a “tension in the air,” said resident Susan Blunt, a feeling that  although a threat may not be imminent, sunset held a primal menace. The sheriff declared a state of emergency, citing “conditions of extreme peril.”
“Not only are we in the dark, it’s almost like we are completely shut off from the world and that makes it even more terrifying,” said Annette Carter on Tuesday. “I can handle a lot of stuff, but my kids being in fear and not being able to reach out to the world and find out what’s going on ... that’s problematic.”
Carter, who lives on the north end of the lake, is raising three children, including her daughter’s two toddlers. The little ones, she said, were filthy and “all I can do is wash them down with a wash rag.” The blackout made them terrified of the dark, she said, so that she now can’t even close their bedroom door at night.
Carter froze two cases of water before losing power to keep her freezer cold, but it started to melt on the fourth day, which meant lost groceries. She figures she’s already out more than $100, and can’t afford to lose more. She’s an in-home healthcare aide but hasn’t been able to work since the outage. Her husband works at a maintenance yard. It’s going to take her about three weeks to make up lost wages, which means paying rent late, she said.
“Fortunately, I have a really cool landlord and he’s understanding,” she said. “But I think if this continues to go on, he can’t be so understanding.”
PG&E began restoring power shortly after dark on Wednesday and completed the task Thursday. Worn-out residents cleaned up and moved on. Rotten food was double-bagged to keep critters out before being tossed. Neighbors shared social media tips on how to survive the next outage — battery-powered fairy lights in the bathroom, a clever way to brew coffee in the car.
Carter, despite a case of strep throat, helped her kids get ready to trick-or-treat: One dressed as Chase, the German shepard cop-dog from “Paw Patrol,” and the other as a cave girl.
But, like many residents, she said the insecurity doesn’t end with electricity restored.
“They have stolen our  peace of mind,” she said. “We’re still reeling.”
Friday is Nov. 1 — when rent is due in this region where most people are paycheck-to-paycheck or on public assistance, and which is described as “California’s ugly stepsister” by resident Gabrielle Brady.
Multiple people who spoke to The Times said the cost of the blackout, including gas, replacing food and lost income, could break them financially. Small-business owners have spent thousands on generators to stay open, and lost thousands more with spoiled inventory and missing sales. The county, one of the most cash-strapped in the state, spent nearly $700,000 on generators and supplies.
Jose Arevalo owns the Country Kitchen restaurant in Clearlake Oaks, a town of about six blocks and 2,000 people along Highway 20. He estimates that after being closed for four days, he could lose more than $10,000.
After the last blackout, he realized he couldn’t afford to be closed that long. It forced him to burn through the savings he had squirreled away for the upcoming slow months. So he hunted down a generator 100 miles away in Yuba City and paid $1,700 for it. It takes about 12 gallons of gas at a time and runs  for only six hours. That means he had to come in at 3 a.m. each day or it would shut off and he would lose all his food. But gas became scarce — there were no open stations in town.
“It’s stressful,” he said. “You have to get [money] from somewhere else to continue to pay the bills.”
Almost all in Lake County agree on one thing: They have contempt for Pacific Gas & Electric.  Though residents say they understand the need to shut off power for imminent fire threats, they distrust the utility’s methods and motives. They suspect the shut-offs are more about avoiding liability than public safety. Almost everyone has an opinion on what should be done, from breaking up the utility to taking it over.
“Our 11th disaster in four years was brought not by wildfire, not by flood, but by the negligence and abuse of authority of the Pacific Gas & Electric Co. and the California Public Utilities Commission,” county and city leaders wrote Wednesday in a letter to the CPUC.
Many residents said the utility hadn’t been honest or fair, or lived up to its promises about helping residents through the blackouts.
Jerry Gully sat on a bar stool in the dim daylight inside Moose Lodge 2284 on Tuesday, wondering whether he could rig up a generator to pump water from a well. Most wells here are run on electric pumps, which means many people don’t have water. But if he could pump, Gully could flush the toilets, which means he could open the place up as an evacuation center for the Kincade fire.
The lodge, a concrete bunker on a hill with llamas grazing at its base, is normally a thriving social club for its 586 members, mostly seniors who come for cocktails and conversation. But it has also served as a shelter for almost all of the fires that have swept through in recent years, burning more than 60% of Lake County.
It was supposed to be a charging center during the shut-off. On the bar in front of Gully was a signed contract with PG&E outlining the deal. He said the utility never showed up. He’d like some answers for why the aid station never materialized, but can’t find anyone to ask.
“You can’t just throw people back into the Stone Age,” he said. He’s angry the lodge had to sit this disaster out.
“We’ve never missed any type of community necessity,” he said. “PG&E has massively dropped the ball on this stuff.”
Gov. Gavin Newsom is also a target of anger, though he has been vocal in recent days about cracking down on PG&E. The California Public Utilities Commission, which oversees the utility and whose members are appointed by the governor, has launched an investigation into the blackouts. Newsom also pushed for residential customers hit with the shut-offs to receive a $100 credit, a plan the utility at first resisted but has since capitulated on, and announced new aid for outage victims.
But those actions have gained him little favor in Lake County, where President Trump won 43% of the vote to Hillary Clinton’s 47% in 2016, and not much in the way of government help has been seen on the ground yet. Jane King, a friend of Gully’s helping at the lodge, calls it “political yibber yabber.”
A few miles away in a trailer park community, Donald White, a carpenter who previously lived in Redondo Beach, was visiting with a neighbor Wednesday who was sweeping up leaves from the winds that led to the blackout. Both men said they believed taxpayers would ultimately end up paying for the outages, either through increased taxes or raised rates.
“Newsom is a disgrace,” White said. “There’s a lot of people suffering, and Newsom’s there drinking his chardonnay. He’s the chief executive and it all comes from him.”
Though frustration was growing Wednesday, there still was a sense of community and an endurance hardened by isolation.
Denise Serio, an aide at a retirement home that didn’t have a generator, was in Country Kitchen restaurant on Wednesday morning getting coffee for three of her elderly clients. Somebody stole her gas the night before, and she ate a “questionable yogurt” for breakfast, she said. She hadn’t showered in days, had to purchase clean underwear, couldn’t fill a critical prescription and couldn’t pay her rent.
When she tried to go to the PG&E charging station about 10 miles away, “it smelled, and one guy is always trying to talk to me about his dog’s anal glands.”
But her worry was that she couldn’t do very much for her patients.
“I can’t wash their clothes. I can’t wash their dishes,” she said. Instead, she spent extra time just visiting with them. On Wednesday afternoon, she used her dwindling gas to drive one client 30 miles to a town with power to have a hot dinner.
“They are my friends and family,” she said while eating a Philly cheesesteak sandwich in a warm restaurant. “I love these people; they’re wonderful.”

‘Fire! Fire!’: Neighbors spread warning of encroaching Hillside fire in San Bernardino,https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2019-10-31/homes-burning-in-san-bernardino-as-fire-sweeps-into-neighborhood,2019-10-31,"Fierce winds that whipped up early Thursday sparked new fires across Southern California, including a destructive blaze that tore into neighborhoods in north San Bernardino, consuming homes and forcing residents to evacuate before dawn.
The Hillside fire erupted about 1:40 a.m. above San Bernardino near Highway 18 at Lower Waterman Canyon and took off, quickly burning downhill into neighborhoods as authorities rushed to awaken and evacuate residents. The blaze has consumed 200 acres and has burned six homes, said San Bernardino County Firefighter Chris Prater.
The fast-moving fire prompted mandatory evacuation orders for roughly 1,300 residents of about 500 homes north of 50th Street, west of Highway 18 and east of Mayfield Avenue.
One firefighter was hospitalized for smoke inhalation, but no other injuries were reported.
Footage from the scene showed waves of embers flying onto residential streets, igniting palm trees and setting homes ablaze.
As police and firefighters were evacuating neighborhoods early Thursday, some residents refused to leave.
“Stay vigilant, please. You don’t see the wind blowing really hard right now where we’re at, but you go up on the hills and it’s very erratic,” said Kathleen Opliger, incident commander for the Fire Department. “The fire has moved so fast ... that if folks don’t evacuate when we ask them to, it’ll be very difficult to get them out when the fire is moving toward homes.”
By late morning firefighters had knocked down active flames burning in the area and had begun to gain control of the blaze. The cause of the fire, which was 50% contained by 1 p.m., is under investigation. However, fire officials said they’ve determined there are no power lines in the area where they determined the blaze began.
Video footage from the scene taken early Thursday showed waves of embers flying onto residential streets, igniting palm trees and setting homes ablaze. Firefighters sprayed water on two homes burning on Saturn Court, but they appeared to sustain significant damage.
Tony Marzullo, 59, said screams from his neighbor across the street jolted him awake about 2 a.m.
“Fire! Fire!” she yelled.
Outside, the hillsides were burning, winds were gusting and yards were catching fire as embers landed. Marzullo, his son and son-in-law immediately got to work. They helped neighbors from their homes and drove cars sitting in driveways to a nearby church after people had fled. They grabbed garden hoses and tried to douse whatever flames they could.
“Those winds were treacherous,” Marzullo said. “The winds here blow in every direction.”
California
Red-flag warnings have been extended for the windiest spots of L.A. and Ventura counties, but the unusually long Santa Ana wind event is expected to ease. No rain is in the forecast, though.
The winds that sweep through San Bernardino are as familiar as the hillsides that are a backdrop for more than a dozen homes along Viento Way, named after the Spanish word for “wind.”
Before dawn, the gusts were so powerful that water sprayed from hoses was instantly blown into a fine mist that was nearly useless against the raging flames.
Marzullo and his sons were able to put down some flames before a palm caught fire and two of his neighbors’ houses caught fire. Standing in his driveway, he watched the smoke rising from the charred remains of one of the homes, where only a chimney remained standing. Still, firefighters were able to save most of houses on the street.
The winds, the chaos of a wildfire and the loss of property were a familiar experience for Marzullo. In the 1980s, he lost his home to the Panorama fire, which destroyed 310 homes and burned 28,000 acres in San Bernardino County.
This time, his house was safe. Any home destroyed is never a good feeling, he said, but the neighborhood is still standing.
“Overall, it turned out OK,” he said.
Nearby, Rhonda Vigneux stood outside her single-story home — arms crossed to keep warm — gazing at firetrucks parked in the street. Her home was still standing.
“I’m so grateful, but sad for our next-door neighbor,” the 52-year-old said, pointing where a wooden home had stood hours before. “They’re such nice people. The neighbor was the one who woke us up.”
Shortly after 2 a.m., Vigneux said she heard banging on the front window of her home and the panicked sound of her neighbor yelling: “There’s a fire, there’s a fire! It’s in your backyard!”
Massive flames greeted Vigneux and her boyfriend, Victor Thome, 52, when they ran to the sliding doors in the back of their house. They ran around trying to decide what valuables to grab.
Thome grabbed a hose and started spraying down the house as thick smoke choked the neighborhood. He stayed to protect their residence as Vigneux evacuated with their two dogs. Hours later, she returned to survey the damage. In the backyard, the bean-shaped pool was filled with blackened remnants from the fire: ash, charred leaves and burned pieces of wood. The wooden fence was gone, having been quickly consumed in the flames.
“I’m just shocked,” Vigneux said. “It happened so fast.”
At the evacuation center at Pacific High School early Thursday, about 10 people sat on cots lined up inside the gym waiting for news about the fire. A few children in pajamas dribbled basketballs nearby.
Linda Serafin, 34, and her family were among the first to arrive shortly after 3 a.m. after they fled from their home on 50th Street when the fire roared into nearby neighborhoods. Orange flames were visible from her backyard, and the smell of smoke hung in the air.
They grabbed items they had packed in preparation for the Old Water fire, which broke out in the area last week, as well as important documents, food, clothes and blankets and loaded them into their car. Schools were still open, but Serafin said she wanted her children close for the day.
It’s a “mother’s precaution,” she said.
More than 450 firefighters, helicopters and fixed-wing aircraft were working to protect homes and get control of the raging blaze, despite intense winds of 20-40 mph with gusts up to 70 mph, officials said.
“The wind has been the biggest factor in the fire spread,” Prater said.
Meanwhile, a blaze that broke out about 12:40 a.m. at Rancho Jurupa Park in Jurupa Valley,dubbed the 46 fire, has burned 300 acres and forced mandatory evacuations. The fire has damaged at least two homes, according to the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection.
The two blazes were among more than two dozen fires that were sparked in the past two days by an extreme Santa Ana wind event, creating dangerous fire conditions that will batter Southern California through late Thursday.
The air will continue to be dry through the day, and the winds, while tapering off, will still be strong, expected to gust between 40 and 60 mph. The fire area in San Bernardino is expecting single-digit humidity levels and sustained winds of 30-40 mph, according to the National Weather Service.
Intense winds projected to last through the day prompted Southern California Edison to shut off power to nearly 73,000 customers in six counties, including San Bernardino near where the Hillside fire is burning.
The utility is monitoring 223,000 other customers across the state for possible shut-offs later in the day as the winds continue.

Extreme winds fueled fires and toppled big rigs. But firefighters were prepared for battle,https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2019-10-31/how-firefighters-gained-control-easy-fire,2019-10-31,"At the top of theRonald Reagan Presidential Libraryin Simi Valley, the winds were so powerful that people couldn’t stand up straight.
In Fontana, gusts blew over big-rig trucks on the freeway.
And across Southern California, the Santa Ana winds sprayed embers far and wide, sparking more than a dozen fires from Calabasas to rural Riverside County.
But all the unusual warnings about the strong winds — which prompted an“extreme” fire weatherwarning that local National Weather Service meteorologists can’t remember making before — gave the region time to prepare.
This time, firefighters credited an intense surge in pre-deployed firefighting resources.
The fight is far from over; the extreme red-flag warning remains in effect through Thursday night, and the Easy fire threatening Ventura County remains out of control. But officials say the preparations for the winds this time have given them a fighting chance that they didn’t have last year, when the Woolsey fire — one of California’s most destructive on record — burned more than 1,000 homes and resulted in three deaths. Officials have said the battle against that fire was hampered by a lack of resources.
Legislation passed in Sacramento, first signed by Gov. Jerry Brown and then made permanent under Gov. Gavin Newsom, has allocated millions of dollars to pre-position firefighting resources during severe fire weather. As a result, on Wednesday, after the weather service’s extreme fire weather warning, a lot more firefighters were prepared to tackle the fire that bounded toward the presidential library, a repository of records and artifacts from the Reagan administration, Ventura County Fire Chief Mark Lorenzen said.
There was ample air support, with helicopters and fixed-wing aircraft repeatedly dropping loads of water nearby. The California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection and the California Office of Emergency Services sent additional trucks, keeping flames from homes and the library. About 800 firefighters fought the Easy fire, which began near Easy Street and Madera Road in Simi Valley shortly after 6 a.m.
“They worked the flanks pretty hard, and then they were incredibly vital when the fire crossed the 23 [Freeway],” Lorenzen said of the air resources. “We had the DC-10 come in and lay down retardant along the 23 and then right in that neighborhood above it, and it gave us the opportunity to get in there and knock it down. In the absence of the aircraft there, that would have been a really big challenge for us to contain that fire.”
This Santa Ana event was forecast to be unusually strong and long-lasting, and weather observations showed how dangerous the conditions were. Gusts of up to 78 mph were recorded on Boney Peak in the Santa Monica Mountains; Camarillo recorded 55 mph.
The air was parched dry, with relative humidity hitting zero atop Mt. Wilson in the San Gabriel Mountains and on peaks in the Santa Ynez Mountains and the Los Padres National Forest, National Weather Service meteorologist Lisa Phillips said.
Vegetation was also extremely dry. Autumn rains have been late in Southern California for each of the last three fall seasons, a big factor in the severe fire weather the region has suffered in recent years.
Drier autumns put California at risk because that’s when Santa Ana winds come sailing out of high-pressure areas in the deserts of Nevada and Utah and target low-pressure voids toward the California coast. As they come down mountain slopes and speed through mountain passes, the intensely dry and fast-moving winds raise the risk of critical fire weather in highly populated areas.
On Wednesday, humidity levels all over Southern California were dry even at lower elevations, with Sinaloa Lake in Simi Valley getting as low as 8% and Moorpark, 7%. Humidity of 15% to 20% is considered quite dry.
The National Weather Service warned that conditions will remain extreme through most of Thursday. The air will continue to be dry, and although Santa Ana winds have probably peaked, they’ll still be strong, expected to gust between 40 mph and 60 mph, said weather service meteorologist Kristen Stewart.
It’s possible that red-flag warnings — a term used to describe critical fire danger because of high winds, low humidity, and dry vegetation — will be extended for valley hills and mountains beyond Thursday afternoon. Thursday night through Friday, top winds will weaken to gusts of 25 mph to 35 mph.
The monster Santa Ana event is being fueled in part by intensely cold high pressure over the Rocky Mountains.
“There’s actually record cold air mass right now over the Rockies and the Great Basin,” said Daniel Swain, climate scientist with UCLA and the National Center for Atmospheric Research. In Boulder, Colo., there’s a foot of snow on the ground and the temperature is 9 degrees — in October.
“This extremely cold air mass directly from the Arctic is sitting just to the east of California. And that is obviously a great contrast with the not-so-frigid air over California, and especially as you get closer to the ocean,” Swain said. “That thermal contrast is setting up that strong pressure contrast, which is in turn driving these very strong winds.”
Temperatures along the California coast are close to average for this time of year, but to the state’s east, they’re well below average — an extreme difference that’s driving the winds, Swain said.
The air mass “dropped straight down southward out of the Arctic over the Rockies because there’s such a big mass of high pressure over Alaska right now, where they have been experiencing record warmth on a recurring basis, and where there is effectively no sea ice on the Arctic Ocean coast for the first time in recorded history in October.”
The warm mass of air over Alaska, as a result, has had the effect of placing “a big blob of cold air over the Rockies, which is creating this extreme contrast that’s generating the winds in California,” Swain said.
Cold Santa Anas can be destructive. The Thomas fire that killed two people and destroyed more than 1,000 structures in Ventura and Santa Barbara counties came during a cool Santa Ana wind event in 2017.
Colder Santa Ana winds can in some ways be more dangerous than warmer Santa Anas, said climatologist Bill Patzert, especially if the high-pressure system behind them is stationary.
Because the air is so cold, it’s also very heavy.
“So it accelerates more rapidly, because it’s so heavy coming through these passes — that’s why you’re getting these extreme wind speeds,” Patzert said.
One way forecasters predict Santa Ana winds is to measure the difference in pressure between Los Angeles International Airport and the community of Daggett in the San Bernardino County desert. The record for October, which sees particularly flammable vegetation if autumn rains haven’t yet arrived, is negative 10.2 millibars, which occurred Oct. 21 and Oct. 22, 2007. On Oct. 21, 2007, a downed San Diego Gas & Electric Co. power line started the Witch fire, which burned nearly 200,000 acres, destroyed more than 1,000 homes, and left two dead.
The forecast pressure difference for this extreme red-flag event was negative 10 millibars. But by Wednesday night, the difference came in short of that, reaching negative 9.3 millibars.
Southern California is expected to get a break from Santa Ana conditions next week, but there is no outlook for rain over the next 10 days.
Weather conditions have improved in Northern California, which has also seen severe fire weather over the last week. Red-flag warnings in the Bay Area expired Wednesday afternoon as winds have eased, although forecasters warned that the air is still quite dry.

"From Simi Valley to wine country, extreme winds and explosive fires maintain hold on California",https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2019-10-30/fire-wind-simi-valley-kincade-california,2019-10-31,"Buffeted byunusually strong winds,brush fires broke out across Southern California on Wednesday, sending thousands of people fleeing, closing major freeways and threatening the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library.
The cycle of fire began Wednesday morning when flames surrounded the library and museum in Simi Valley and stalked nearby neighborhoods as it swiftly scorched hundreds of acres in Ventura County. As the day wore on and the winds howled, more than a dozen other smaller fires erupted in communities including Riverside, Santa Clarita, Brea, Whittier, Lancaster, Calabasas, Long Beach, Nuevo and Jurupa Valley.
The outlook was brighter in Northern California, where thousands of evacuees began to return home as firefighters started to gain the upper hand on the wine country blaze that has scorched more than 76,000 acres and burned dozens of homes.
The biggest battle Wednesday was in Ventura County, where 800 firefighters trying to control the wind-whipped fire surrounding the presidential library were stymied by intense  gusts that sent embers flying far beyond the body of the blaze. Helicopters repeatedly dropped loads of water around the Reagan complex, which is perched atop a hill blanketed in dense brush, amid 60-mph winds that were strong enough to knock a person off balance.
California
The Easy fire has chewed through 1,600 acres of dry, dense brush. After leaping across a road, it made a run for the Reagan Presidential Library.
The Easy fire began near Easy Street and Madera Road in Simi Valley shortly after 6 a.m. and bounded toward the library, a repository of records and artifacts from the Reagan administration, officials said.
“Unfortunately it was about the worst time it could happen — 40-mile-an-hour sustained winds and fuels that were ripe and ready to carry fire,” said Ventura County Fire Chief Mark Lorenzen.
Though flames surrounded the 125,000-square-foot center for several hours, the library was not damaged, officials said.
The blaze, which had chewed through 1,400 acres of brush as of Wednesday afternoon, burned at least one home on Tierra Rejada Road and threatened an additional 7,000 in parts of Simi Valley, Thousand Oaks and Moorpark.
Southern California Edison confirmed Wednesday evening that the fire broke out in its service territory near one of its sub-transmission lines, which was not de-energized at the time of ignition. The exact cause of the fire remains unknown.
The utility has notified the California Public Utilities Commission that there was activity on the sub-transmission line around the reported time of the fire, spokesman Robert Villegas said.
Rory Kaplan, who has lived just south of the library for nearly two decades, fled among an exodus of neighbors Wednesday morning. About 26,000 people were evacuated because of the Easy fire, officials said.
“One thing is sure,” Kaplan said. “They aren’t going to let Reagan’s library burn — and that protects us.”
For many in the state, evacuating their homes has become a familiar routine as wildfires threaten the same suburban neighborhoods yearly. That is particularly true in Ventura County, where the Woolsey fire was sparked last November and where, the year before, the Thomas firegrew to become the largest fire in state historyat the time.
Kris Mae, 69, hunkered down at an evacuation center in Thousand Oaks on Wednesday after leaving her home a few miles from the library. Her car had been packed for a month, with several suitcases, boxes of important files and a fire safe — just in case.
“It’s too hard to pack and unpack over and over,” she said.
Though California has experienced multiple deadly blazes in the last few years, weather officials warned that this week could lend itself to conditions that are even worse.
Abnormally strong winds that began Tuesday night are expected to continue through Thursday and could reach up to 80 mph in mountain areas. Such wind conditions, which weather officials deemed “extreme red-flag” danger, have not been seen since 2007, when they helped unleash the sixth-most destructive fire in California history.
Ernie Muro, 73, walked his Chihuahua mix Lulu through his lush yard Wednesday afternoon in Simi Valley’s Wood Ranch neighborhood, preparing to leave when the time came. As he stood outside, helicopters repeatedly dropped water near the avocado orchard next to his house.
California
When the Easy Fire erupted early Wednesday morning in Simi Valley, a priority quickly arose: Save the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library.
This isn’t the first time he has seen fire from his home, he said.
“We’ve had them all around us before,” Muro said. “This time of year is nerve-racking.”
By midday Wednesday, Southern California was facing peak fire weather, with winds of up to 78 mph at Boney Peak in the Santa Monica Mountains in Ventura County, while relative humidity fell to rock bottom, clocking in at zero at Mt. Wilson in the San Gabriel Mountains and peaks in the Santa Ynez Mountains and the Los Padres National Forest, Phillips said.
The air was exceedingly dry throughout Ventura County. Relative humidity was 8% at Sinaloa Lake and 7% in Moorpark. With the winds, that could be a dangerous combination, experts said.
“The magnitude of the wind gusts really is going to be a concern,” said Daniel Swain, climate scientist with UCLA and the National Center for Atmospheric Research.
The forecast of extreme Santa Ana winds prompted Southern California Edison to say it might shut off power to more than 340,000 customers in Los Angeles, Ventura, Santa Barbara, San Bernardino and Riverside counties.
California
A few areas were still off-limits, including some parts of Kenter Avenue and Mountaingate Avenue, as firefighters continued to tame the Getty fire.
Also Wednesday, a fire in the Riverside County town of Nuevo began shortly after 7 a.m., burning several structures. Hours later, the Hill fire in the Jurupa Valley community of Riverside Countyprompted mandatory evacuations and closed the 60 Freewayin both directions. The Brea Canyon fire in eastern Los Angeles County burned 5 acres at Brea Canyon Road and briefly forced closure of the 57 Freeway.
The Getty fire, which damaged 12 homes Monday, continued to keep more than 7,000 people out of their homes in and around Brentwood. As of Wednesday morning, the blaze was 27% contained, but increasing containment any further became challenging because of the powerful winds.
As conditions worsened in Southern California, the weather farther north provided a respite for firefighters who had been battling strong winds.
Firefighters in wine country were able to double the containment of the massive Kincade fire to 30% as of Wednesday morning, according to the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection. The fire has already burned 76,825 acres and destroyed nearly 100 homes, officials say.
Pacific Gas & Electric Co. said Wednesday that it would beginrestoring power to customerswhose electricity was  shut off this week in its latest bid to reduce wildfire risk. Crews will inspect utility lines, repair damage and restore power to about 365,000 customers in its service area, except for Kern County, which is still experiencing strong winds, according to PG&E.
Muro, who was wandering in his yard in Simi Valley, said he and his family would evacuate either when they got notified to do so, or when the fire felt too close.
Muro moved to the neighborhood because it’s quiet — usually — and has views of rolling hillsides and the orchard.
“Why would you want to live anywhere else?” he said as Lulu sat at his feet in the yard, patiently waiting. “It’s beautiful.”

Inside the battle to save the Reagan Library as fire laid siege to landmark,https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2019-10-30/battle-to-save-reagan-library-fire-laid-siege-landmark,2019-10-30,"When theEasy fire eruptedearly Wednesday morning in Simi Valley, the stakes of this particular firefight quickly came into focus:
Save the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library.
The pre-dawn blaze, stoked by strong easterly winds, was racing toward the hilltop compound surrounded by nearly 100 acres of rolling grasslands.
Long vulnerable to wildfire, the library had taken efforts to protect the facility — where Ronald and Nancy Reagan are buried — but this particular assault was unprecedented.
Maneuvering amid 60-mph winds, helicopters circled,unleashing their water dropsbehind the library. Two super-scooper planes swooped low to hit the advancing flames with such an inundation that it created a rainbow in the morning sun.
Every two minutes, a new rotation of choppers or super-scoopers dipped into the canyon behind the library, turning fire into smoke.
“They are getting beat up good, those pilots,” said JD Nees, who flew helicopters for the Navy reserve. With wind gusts reaching 60 mph — strong enough to knock a person off the feet — the choppers bounced and danced in the unpredictable turbulence.A hand crew crested the hill, the inmates working to tamp down the smoldering soil. “That’s a good sign,”  Nees said.
When library planners selected the site in 1987, its location in eastern Ventura County was undeveloped and praised for its views of the adjoining mountains and its Western disposition, isolated and scenic.
California
Times staff photographer Wally Skalij has covered many wildfires for the paper. On Monday, he went to Simi Valley for the Easy fire, where he got a notable shot.
But its rural character brought with it the inherent risk of wildfire. After the firestorms of 2017, 300 goats were brought in to help reduce the excessive fuel load, part of the county’s vegetation management program.
As the Easy fire burned south, it swept down a ridge toward a tract of homes off Madera Road. An off-duty LAPD officer, wearing a raid jacket, began yelling to residents that the fire was approaching. As flames grew visible, homeowners on Roosevelt Court began to make plans.
“I pulled the cars out into the driveway, put the passports and bank documents in one and my musical instruments in the other car,” said Rory Kaplan, who moved here in 2001 when the homes were built.
“I am ready to go,” he said.
The news to evacuate came over a loudspeaker from the Simi Valley police, and Kaplan joined the exodus with his neighbors. Kaplan believed his home would be safe.
“One thing is sure, they aren’t going to let Reagan’s library burn — and that protects us” he said.Soon the roads out of Simi Valley had clogged with residents streaming south toward Thousand Oaks, cars and SUVs jammed with boxes and treasured objects.
In 1993, two years after the library opened, Reagan  stood on the grounds of the library, accompanied by two dozen firefighters, a convoy of fire engines and a fire department helicopter.
He delivered a half-hour speech praising the heroic efforts of the fire crews who had battled the firestorms earlier that year.
Years earlier, the Reagan family had lost their ranch in Malibu to fire, which the president’s daughter, Maureen, mentioned to visitors.
“We live in a place with unique terrain that’s continually touched by fire,” she said, “and thank God we have unique and special men and women that are trained to stop those fires when they threaten people.”

Q&A: How a Times photographer got this Easy fire photo with Reagan’s Air Force One,https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2019-10-30/easy-fire-photo-air-force-one-reagan-library,2019-10-30,"On a hill in Simi Valley overlooking Southern California, the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library is the final resting place of the 40th president and his wife, and the site of his Air Force One aircraft.
That same aircraft was the unlikely anchor for a photo of the hills set alight by theEasy fire, which broke out early Wednesday morning and sent thousands of Simi Valley residentsrunning from their homesbefore dawn.
Staff photographer Wally Skalijhas covered many a fire for The Times. As flames from the Easy fireraced toward the Reagan Library, he was ready and waiting to capture this unique view of the 2019 fire season in Southern California.
The library is designed towithstand earthquakes and wildfires. As the grounds nearby burned, people inside sheltered in place. To hold back the flames, firefighters launchedaggressive attackson the burning ridges near Simi Valley’s residential areas.
In a question-and-answer session, Skalij explained how he got the shot.
I have been shooting fires for over 20 years and think I’ve seen everything, but it seems something new arises at every fire.
It’s not always about the huge flame photos. It’s about giving the viewer a different perspective and telling the story.
I was stationed at theGetty firelast night waiting to see if it would flare up again. I was getting notices that the winds in Simi Valley were gusting around 60 mph so I headed in that direction.
As I arrived, the Easy fire started. I immediately headed to the front of the fire.
My colleague, staff photographer Al Seib, told me the Reagan Library was nearby. I didn’t know what to expect but noticed Air Force One inside overlooking the hills.
I waited for 45 minutes for the fire to arrive.
Overall I was looking for [a moment of] historical value and to create something that would grab the reader.
My only challenge in shooting this photo was not getting kicked out. I wasn’t 100% sure I was allowed to be in there.

Easy fire: Volunteers band together to rescue horses spooked by blaze,https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2019-10-30/easy-fire-horses-evacuated,2019-10-30,"As thefast-moving Easy firetore through Simi Valley on Wednesday, dozens of neighbors helped evacuate panicked horses from ranches in Ventura County’s rural Santa Rosa Valley, often struggling to push or coax the animals into trailers.
A caravan of trailers driven by volunteers snaked its way through the valley’s dusty dirt roads, looking for horses that needed to be evacuated. The cars stopped on a narrow road where volunteers said several horses had been dropped off by a woman whose property was on fire. Over loud whinnies, the good Samaritans tried to coordinate where they should take the animals.
“Anyone have a tall trailer?” one woman shouted, while holding the reins of a horse. “I don’t know if this horse can fit in our trailer.”
Evacuating the animals is challenging, said Fia Perera, 48, who was figuring out whether she needed to move her two horses and her 900-pound pig, Tallulah.
Many horse owners don’t have trailers and depend on volunteers when emergencies force them from their homes. Some animals also aren’t halter-trained, Perera said, making it difficult to move them.
“When they get agitated and excited, you have to be firm,” she said. “If you’re panicky, they pick up on your energy.”

The Easy fire, which broke out shortly after 6 a.m. near Easy Street and Madera Road, has forced thousands of people from their homes as officials try to keep flames from overtaking neighborhoods.
The equestrian community has consistently come together during fires. Volunteers often find people who need help through word-of-mouth or on social media, especially through a Facebook group called Southern California Equine Emergency Evacuation.
California
Here are some tips to keep your pets and large animals safe during a wildfire.
“People come from all over to help out,” Perera said.
Jacqui Masson, 55, drove to the Santa Rosa Valley to help friends evacuate their horses. The horsewoman tries to make herself as useful as possible during fires. She’ll help get horses into trailers or muck stalls at evacuation centers.
“Anytime there’s a fire, people are saying, ‘I’ve got four stalls here, 10 stalls there,’ ” she said.
Raizy Goffman, 79, who lives in Porter Ranch and manages horse shows in Los Angeles, was one of several who arrived with her trailer to help. She spent the morning reaching out to dozens of ranch owners and horse trainers in the area. She stopped at several ranches but left when she saw they already had enough assistance.
“Everything is difficult,” she said of the situation, before jumping in the car to see whether she could help a few yards down the road, where volunteers were trying to get a halter on a horse that hadn’t been broken in.

California fires: Reagan Library threatened in Simi Valley as firefighters make progress in wine country,https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2019-10-30/california-fires-reagan-library-threatened-in-ventura-county-firefighters-make-progress-in-wine-country,2019-10-30,"A large brush fire erupted in Simi Valley early Wednesday and was quickly burning toward neighborhoods, triggering mandatory evacuations amid strong Santa Ana winds
Firefighters in Southern California were battling a fast-moving brush fire that was threatening thousands of homes and the Ronald Reagan Library in Ventura County, while crews made progress against the Kincade fire that’s been burning for a week in Northern California’s wine country.
The Easy fire, which started near the 118 Freeway and Madera Road in Simi Valley shortly after 6 a.m., has chewed through 1,300 acres of dry, dense brush and is threatening 6,500 homes, Ventura County Fire Capt. Steve Kaufmann said.
The blaze isburning near the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library. Thick smoke choked the hillside where the 125,000-square-foot complex — a repository of records and artifacts from the Reagan administration — is perched among dense brush. Flames burned all around the library but it has not been damaged, officials said.
Amid wind gusts strong enough to knock a person off balance, tanker helicopters dropped their loads behind the library and two super-scooper planes unleashed such a volume of water it created its own rainbow.
The Easy fire was one of several burning in Southern California.
Despite extreme red flag warnings because of the powerful Santa Ana winds, firefighters were hoping to increase containment of theGetty firein Brentwood.
The fire, which burned 12 homes Monday, was 27% contained and had scorched 745 acres as of Wednesday morning, officials said. About 7,000 homes remain evacuated.
Meanwhile, in Northern California, firefighters were exerting more control over the massive Kincade fire , which grew slightly to 76,825 acres.
Containment of the fire doubled overnight to 30% as of Wednesday morning, according to the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection.
“The eastern part of the fire was active overnight, but firefighters continued to make forward progress as a whole,” even amid another strong wind event (forecast to be the week’s last), Cal Fire said.
Tuesday night, winds reached 60 mph in high terrain and up to 30 mph in the valleys where the fire is burning, said Spencer Tangen, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service. By Wednesday morning, the winds had already begun to slow..

Firefighters battle to save Reagan Library as Easy fire reaches its doorstep,https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2019-10-30/firefighters-battle-to-save-reagan-library-from-fast-moving-easy-fire,2019-10-30,"A large brush fire erupted in Simi Valley early Wednesday and was quickly burning toward neighborhoods, triggering mandatory evacuations amid strong Santa Ana winds
Perched on a hill overlooking Simi Valley and Moorpark, the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library offers sweeping views. But that location has long made it vulnerable to wildfires.
On Wednesday, the fast-movingEasy firehad surrounded the library, which was closed to the public. Those in the library sheltered in place as helicopters dumped thousands of gallons of water on nearby flames and fire crews cut containment lines around the fast-moving blaze.
The fire was being held back by an aggressive ground and aerial attack on the ridges beyond Simi’s modern residential estates.
Helicopters repeatedly dropped loads of water behind the library amid 60-mph winds, turning the flames on the ridge 300 feet below into smoke. Amid wind gusts strong enough to knock a person off balance, two super-scooper planes dipped down behind the library before unleashing such a volume of water it created its own rainbow.
Every two minutes, a new chopper or super-scooper swooped overhead, dipping down into the canyon behind the library.
“They are getting beat up good, those pilots,” JD Nees, a Navy reserve pilot, said of the helicopter pilots who are navigating 60-mph winds whipping across their paths. “I have flown those things.”
Nees watched as the pilots made run after run at the flames before a hand crew appeared on the hill. “That’s a good sight to see,” he said, as two inmates crews began working to tamp out the smoldering soil.
As the fire swept down the ridge toward Roosevelt Court, an off-duty LAPD officer wearing a raid jacket began yelling, alerting residents that the fire was coming down the hill. Tensions immediately heightened as the flames became visible to homeowners.
Rory Kaplan has lived on Roosevelt since the homes were built there in 2001.
“I got the reverse 911 about 6:30 a.m.,” he said. “I pulled the cars out into the driveway, put the passports and bank documents in one and my musical instruments in the other car. I am ready to go.”
Simi police began directing everyone via loudspeaker to leave the neighborhood behind the Reagan Library. Kaplan joined the exodus.
“One thing is sure, they aren’t going to let Reagan’s Library burn — and that protects us,” he said.
Roads out of Simi Valley were packed as residents poured south toward Thousand Oaks, their cars and SUVs brimming with boxes packed with treasured objects.
The library, which is designed to withstand earthquakes and wildfires, has been threatened by fire in the past. Officials say they take pains to protect the facility, ensuring that the open space around the building is kept clear. Each year, the library bringsin goatsto eat vegetation around the buildings.
Opened in 1991,the libraryis home to the Marine One presidential helicopter, Air Force One presidential aircraft, a piece of the Berlin Wall, a replica of Reagan’s White House Oval Office and a steel beam recovered from the World Trade Center after 9/11.
Two years after the library opened, the Reagan family threw a celebration there for firefighters who battled Southern California’s 1993 firestorms.
“Many years ago, we lost our old ranch in Malibu to fire,” the president’s daughter Maureen Reagan said at the time. “When those winds start to blow, the same could happen to any one of us. We live in a place with unique terrain that’s continually touched by fire, and thank God we have unique and special men and women that are trained to stop those fires when they threaten people.”
The Easy fire, which broke out shortly after 6 a.m., has burned 1,300 acres and is threatening 6,500 homes.

"Easy fire, burning out of control in Ventura County, started near Edison line, utility says",https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2019-10-30/large-brush-fire-erupts-in-simi-valley-near-reevacuations-in-simi-valley,2019-10-31,"A major brush fire swept by gusts of Santa Ana winds up to 65 mph raced through Simi Valley hillsides toward neighborhoods Wednesday, threatening 7,000 homes and forcing thousands of residents to flee.
The Easy fire, which started near Easy Street and Madera Road shortly after 6 a.m., quickly burned toward Tierra Rejada Road, leaped across the street and made a run toward theRonald Reagan Presidential Library, said Ventura County Fire Chief Mark Lorenzen.
“Unfortunately, it was about the worst time it could happen — 40-mile-an-hour sustained winds and fuels that were ripe and ready to carry fire,” he said.
Southern California Edison confirmed Wednesday evening that the fire broke out in its service territory near one of its subtransmission lines, which was not de-energized at the time of the eruption. The exact cause of the fire remains unknown.
The utility has notified the California Public Utilities Commission that there was activity on the subtransmission line near the reported time of the fire, spokesman Robert Villegas said.
Southern California Edison “is conducting a review into the circumstances surrounding the fire and will cooperate with all investigations into the origin and cause,” Villegas said. He said the utility’s top priority is the safety of its customers, employees and communities.
Thick smoke choked the hillside where the 125,000-square-foot library — a repository of records and artifacts from the Reagan administration — is perched amid dense brush. Flames burned on all sides, but the library has not sustained damage, officials said.
Shortly after 3 p.m., the fire jumped the 23 Freeway in the Moorpark area, where firefighters took a stand to prevent it from spreading west toward the Santa Rosa Valley. Crews pounced on the flames and extinguished the spot fire before it took hold, Lorenzen said at an evening news briefing.
“We have been able to at least defeat that part of the fire there and keep it from spreading toward the west,” he said.
The blaze, which has chewed through more than 1,600 acres of dense, dry brush, is also burning east toward homes along Madera Road. At least one home on Tierra Rejada was damaged and 7,000 others are threatened. Three firefighters are being treated at a local hospital for suspected smoke inhalation, authorities said.
About 30,000 residents in portions of Simi Valley, Moorpark and Thousand Oaks have been evacuated. “Be ready and prepared,” Lorenzen said. “When we ask you to leave, please leave immediately.”
There was no containment of the fire as of Wednesday night. Although firefighters had bulldozer and hose line around a significant section of the blaze, they will not consider it contained until it has been wind tested for 12 hours. Fire officials anticipated the containment figure would increase Thursday, as long as things remain under control.
The size of the fire pales in comparison to Ventura County’s previous wind-driven monsters: the Thomas fire in 2017 that burned almost 282,000 acres and remains the second largest fire in the state’s modern history, and the Woolsey fire, the seventh most destructive fire in state history, which burned almost 97,000 acres in Ventura and Los Angeles counties and destroyed about 1,600 structures, including several homes.
Fire officials said this time was different, in part because of what they’ve learned from previous fires and because they had substantially more resources from the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection and the Governor’s Office of Emergency Services.
Lorenzen said that given the extreme wind event warning, Cal Fire sent more firefighters to the region, and thanks to a recent boost in state funding, there were more strike teams that also came to the area.
Helicopters and fixed-wing aircraft were also crucial, as they aided ground crews in keeping the fire skinny, Lorenzen said.
“They worked the flanks pretty hard, and then they were incredibly vital when the fire crossed the 23,” Lorenzen said. “We had the DC-10 come in and lay down retardant along the 23 and then right in that neighborhood above it, and it gave us the opportunity to get in there and knock it down. In the absence of the aircraft there, that would have been a really big challenge for us to contain that fire.”
The efforts of 800 firefighters, eight air tankers and nine helicopters trying to get control of the fast-moving blaze were stymied through the morning by extreme wind conditions.
The fire quickly outflanked crews as gusts picked up embers and carried them through the air. Wind-driven embers have been known to blow miles ahead of the front line of a blaze, setting spot fires and igniting homes. For that reason, officials cautioned people near the evacuation zones to keep their doors and windows closed.
Tanker aircraft dropping water and fire retardant were forced to divert from the area periodically because of turbulence, officials said.
“The [conditions for] air assets are challenging at best,” Ventura County Fire Capt. Steve Kaufmann said. “You can see a lot of the water that’s coming from the ‘super scoopers’ is atomized because of the wind. It definitely makes it challenging for us.”
Ventura County Assistant Fire Chief Chad Cook said significant manpower was devoted to areas near the Reagan Library through the morning to protect the landmark. Helicopters repeatedly dropped loads of water behind the library amid 60-mph winds, turning the flames into smoke on a ridge 300 feet below. As wind gusts blew strong enough to knock a person off balance, two ‘super scooper’ planes dipped down behind the library, unleashing a large volume of water that created its own rainbow.
With fire sweeping down the ridge toward Roosevelt Court, an off-duty LAPD officer began yelling, alerting residents that the blaze was headed down the hill. Tensions immediately heightened as the flames became visible to homeowners.
Rory Kaplan has lived on Roosevelt since the homes were built there in 2001.
“I got the reverse 911 about 6:30 a.m.,” he said. “I pulled the cars out into the driveway, put the passports and bank documents in one and my musical instruments in the other car. I am ready to go.”

Times staff photographer Wally Skalij has covered many wildfires for the paper. On Monday, he went to Simi Valley for the Easy fire, where he got a notable shot.
Simi Valley police began directing everyone via loudspeaker to leave the neighborhood behind the Reagan Library. Kaplan joined the exodus.
“One thing is sure,” he said. “They aren’t going to let Reagan’s library burn — and that protects us.”
Just south of Madera Road, a group of neighbors stood in an intersection in the Village on the Green neighborhood in the Wood Ranch area, watching the fire crawl down nearby hillsides and waiting to see whether they would be evacuated.
Helicopters flew close overhead, the sound of their engines echoing as they dumped load after load of water on the blaze. The wind ebbed and flowed through the neighborhood, shooting cold air past the group.
“I’m not so nervous, but my wife is,” Erik Roodman, 54, said as he watched the action. “She already has a bag packed. I just made sure I had clean clothes on in case I need to go.”
Hours earlier, thousands of residents fled their homes as wind-whipped flames rapidly consumed large swaths of brush, casting hillsides in an orange glow.
All Simi Valley public schools were closed because of the fire, and a shelter has been set up at the Thousand Oaks Community Center at 2525 N. Moorpark Road.
Kris Mae, 69, was one of the first people to arrive at the community center. Mae, an early riser, had been watching television on mute and listening to the radio when she heard the announcer say there was a fire near the Reagan Library — about four miles from her house. Outside, she saw a beige-and-red-hued plume of smoke.
“I’m right in the path,” she said. “That’s why I left my house, because it was so close.”
But she was prepared. She had packed her car with several suitcases, boxes of important files and a fire safe about a month ago when the first major fires of the season started.
“It’s too hard to pack and unpack over and over,” she said. “I’m a very nervous person when I get shaken.”
Chandler Collins, 23, was jolted awake early Wednesday by the sound of his grandmother banging on his door. They had to evacuate.
It was still dark outside, but he could see flames licking uphill near their home, which is on the same road as the Reagan Library. He threw together some clothing, pet supplies for his cat, Shadow, and his chinchilla, Rocket, plus his Halloween costume, in case he couldn’t make it back home before his dress-up day at work Thursday.
“I’ve never done this before, but it’s probably going to happen more often,” he said of the evacuations.
California
When the Easy Fire erupted early Wednesday morning in Simi Valley, a priority quickly arose: Save the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library.
The Easy fire was one ofseveral blazesthat broke out across Southern California on Wednesday.
Throughout the day firefighters converged on multiple blazes throughout the region — the Hill fire in Jurupa Valley in Riverside is the largest of the others at 200 acres and at times closed the 60 Freeway. Fires broke out in Whittier Narrows, Brea, Calabasas and at least one other in Riverside.
The new fires come amid dangerous weather conditions and the threat of more intentional power blackouts as utility companies attempt to reduce wildfire risk.
In the area of the Easy fire, gusts of about 30 mph from the northeast were reported nearby around 8 a.m., National Weather Service meteorologist Lisa Phillips said.
By midday Wednesday, Southern California was facing peak fire weather, with winds of up to 78 mph at Boney Peak in the Santa Monica Mountains in Ventura County, while relative humidity fell to rock bottom, clocking at zero at Mt. Wilson in the San Gabriel Mountains and peaks in the Santa Ynez Mountains and the Los Padres National Forest, Phillips said.
The air was exceedingly dry throughout Ventura County. Relative humidity was 8% at Sinaloa Lake and 7% in Moorpark.
Forecasters said the winds would be the strongest to hit the region in recent memory.
“The magnitude of the wind gusts really is going to be a concern,” said Daniel Swain, climate scientist with UCLA and the National Center for Atmospheric Research. “The actual winds that people experience really will be quite extreme in a lot of places, really everywhere except for the wind-sheltered parts of downtown L.A. and central L.A.”
The extreme fire weather conditions are expected to persist through Thursday evening, the National Weather Service said. While Santa Ana winds have likely peaked, they’ll still be strong, with expectations of gusts between 40 mph and 60 mph.
It’s also possible that red flag warnings — a term used to describe critical fire weather danger from a combination of high winds, low humidity and dry vegetation — will be extended for valley hills and mountains beyond Thursday afternoon. On Thursday night through Friday, top winds will weaken to gusts of 25 mph to 35 mph.
Southern California is expected to get a break from Santa Ana conditions next week. Unfortunately, there is no outlook for rain over the next 10 days.
The forecast of extreme Santa Ana winds prompted Southern California Edison to say it might shut off power to more than 340,000 customers in Los Angeles, Ventura, Santa Barbara, San Bernardino and Riverside counties.
To the north, Pacific Gas & Electric Co. said Wednesday that it would beginrestoring power to customerswho were shut off this week in its latest bid to reduce wildfire risk. Crews will inspect utility lines, repair damage and restore power to about 365,000 customers in its service area, except for Kern County, which is still experiencing strong winds, according to PG&E.
Fire danger from power lines was underscored Tuesday when L.A. officials said a Los Angeles Department of Water and Powerline hit by a tree branch sparked the Getty fire.

"A year after fire destroyed its town, Paradise’s dream season ends in title game",https://www.latimes.com/sports/highschool/story/2019-11-30/paradise-bobcats-dream-season-ends-in-loss-sutter-union-loss-division-title,2019-12-01,"The dream season of the Paradise Bobcats ended abruptly Saturday in a 20-7 loss to Sutter Union in the Northern Section Division 3 championship game at River Valley High in Yuba City.
In a game played in a steady, cold rain, Paradise’s two fumbles, two interceptions and two red-zone failures led to a loss in a contest the Bobcats (12-1) never led.
It was the first loss in 13 games for a team on amission to claim a championshipthat was denied them last year when their season was cut short after theNov. 8 Camp firedestroyed about 14,000 homes and left most of the city in rubble in the most destructive wildfire in California history. While all the players and coaches survived, 95 of the 104 players lost their homes, as did all but one of the coaches.
“I’m so proud of these young men,” Paradise coach Rick Prinz said after Saturday’s loss. “What they’ve accomplished is about far more than football. Playing for the town, playing for each other. They never stop fighting.”
Sports
Times columnist Bill Plaschke writes about Paradise High School football team’s first season since a devastating fire destroyed their town in November 2018 and claimed the lives of 86 people.
Their mere presence in the section title game seemed unimaginable last spring when they began practice with no helmets, no pads, not even a football. Many players had moved out of the area with their families, so they were initially unsure they could even field a team.
They were dropped from their league because of uncertain enrollment numbers, they had to cobble together a schedule, and nobody knew what to expect.
But nobody expected they would roll through their first dozen games with a passion that inspired rebirth in their leveled city.

California will never control raging wildfires if it doesn’t stop building in high-risk areas,https://www.latimes.com/opinion/story/2019-11-29/california-wildfire-housing-ideas,2019-11-29,"After three years of devastating and deadly wildfires, perhaps we should no longer be surprised by them.
It was shocking in 2017 when the Tubbs fire jumped the 101 Freeway and charred a suburban subdivision in Santa Rosa. It was unthinkable last year when Paradise residents had to run for their lives as the city was almost entirely destroyed by the Camp fire. And still people were caught off guard last month when the Saddleridge fire forced hundreds of residents in Sylmar and Porter Ranch to flee their homes in the middle of the night.
Read the full series
A terrifying pattern has been revealed. California’s wildfires are now regularly destroying subdivisions and established neighborhoods that once seemed at low risk from wildfires. There’s ample scientific data and research to explain why: Climate change amplifies natural variations in the weather, leading to more frequent and more destructive wildfires. Poorly maintained utility lines are setting blazes.
Despite that, we’re still building homes — more and more of them — in fire-prone areas. State and local leaders have been slow to adopt the housing, land-use and development reforms that would make California communities much safer in the coming years. Here are a few suggestions culled from experts that, if enacted soon, could deliver lasting security.
The devastation in Paradise, Santa Rosa, Ventura County and Malibu demonstrated that homes are not only casualties in the fires, but also the fuel that feeds and exacerbates the blazes. Wind-driven fires can blow embers over great distances. The embers lodge under eaves, get sucked into vents or broken windows and can ignite a house from the inside out, which creates more embers and more heat. The fire then spreads from house to house, sometimes leaving surrounding trees largely untouched.
The first and most obvious step is to retrofit homes in high-risk areas to make them more resistant to fire. Researchers analyzed some 40,000 buildings exposed to wildfires between 2013 and 2018. They found that homes built to keep out embers and withstand extreme heat weremuch more likely to survive. Yet so far, the state has done little to require home hardening or to fund it.
The needed retrofits aren’t very expensive. Homeowners should cover their vents with fine wire mesh and enclose their eaves to prevent embers from getting inside the structure. Double-paned windows are less likely to shatter in high heat, and steel shutters can help too.
Properties also need regular inspections to make sure they are prepared for fire season. Are there gaps in roof tiles that might allow embers into the attic? Are the gutters full of dry leaves and twigs? Do the residents know to shut the doggie door when they evacuate?
Earlier this year, Assemblyman Jim Wood (D-Healdsburg) proposed creating abillion-dollar revolving loan fundto help homeowners pay for retrofits and to remove flammable vegetation near their homes. The funding  was cut from the bill.
Next year, Gov. Gavin Newsom and state lawmakers should invest that $1 billion — or more — to help people in high-risk areas make their homes more fire resistant. But it’s not enough to have individual homeowners voluntarily harden their houses if neighboring properties are tinder boxes. Fire is contagious. The greatest protection comes when entire neighborhoods are hardened together and maintained together. Whatever legislation is passed should reflect that.
Still, all the fire-resistant materials and hardening in the world can’t guarantee safety. During the 2017 Thomas fire in Ventura County, new houses built to the strictest fire codesstill burned down. The houses were in a state-designated “very high fire hazard severity zone,” which means the area has the greatest probability of burning based on vegetation, topography and fire history. And when 80-mile-per-hour winds blow embers across a landscape that is already prone to burn, the fire can quickly overwhelm hardened homes.
State officials have to recognize that there are some homes and neighborhoods that shouldn’t be rebuilt. Or rebuilt again, since some communities have burned more than once. For decades, the Federal Emergency Management Agency has helpedbuy out propertiesdestroyed by flood waters, in a bid to stop the expensive and sometimes deadly cycle of flood-rescue-and-rebuild in high-risk areas. In Texas, communities have used a combination of local bonds, drainage fees and federal dollars to buy out flood-prone houses.
Buyouts are considered one of the most cost-effective ways to prevent flood destruction. These are voluntary sales and the government pays fair market value. The homes are demolished and the property becomes open space. It’s pricey to buy up dozens of properties at a time, but it can be cheaper and more effective than developing new flood control infrastructure.
Yet there’s been little discussion in California of trying to use FEMA grants or other funds to make similar buyout offers in high fire-risk areas. It wouldn’t be possible to buy out every property owner in the very high fire hazard severity zones — there are an estimated 2.7 million Californians living there. Rather, a buyout program could target the areas at the very greatest risk, perhaps because the community was built without adequate evacuation routes, or because the neighborhood has been burned two or more times before.
The best way to prevent wildfire destruction and death is to stop building houses in the path of fire. Half of all buildings destroyed by wildfire in California over the last 30 years have been in developedareas next to wildlands.
So far, though, gentle suggestions that local governments should consider wildfire risk when approving development aren’t working, and neither is Newsom’s call to“deprioritize”development in high fire-risk areas. Land-use decisions are made by local elected officials and they’ve proven themselves unwilling to say no to dangerous sprawl development and equally unwilling to say yes to denser, urban infill housing construction that would be more sustainable. Just look at Los Angeles County, where the Board of Supervisorsapprovedconstruction of a 19,000-home mini-city to be built at Tejon Ranch in a remote valley that has been deemed a high risk for wildfires.
California lawmakers need to push — even force — local elected officials to make more responsible development decisions.
Earlier this year, Sen. Hannah-Beth Jackson (D-Santa Barbara) introducedSenate Bill 182, which would prohibit cities and counties from approving new housing developments in high fire-risk areas unless the projects meet new “wildfire risk reduction standards.” Those would include siting the homes so they have natural fire breaks and are easier for firefighters to defend, building evacuation routes, and having an ongoing, funded program to inspect and maintain defensible space around homes.
The bill was held up amid concerns that it could allow anti-growth cities to use the presence of some high fire-risk areas within their borders as an excuse to shirk their responsibility to build enough housing in the non-fire-risk areas of the city. That should not be allowed.
Yes, California has a severe housing shortage that is making the state unaffordable and unlivable for too many people. But the state can’t keep counting on sprawl to solve the housing crisis. That only puts more people at risk in future wildfires, and it generates more greenhouse gases as residents commute from far-flung subdivisions. That hastens climate change, which, in turn, worsens wildfire conditions in California.

Power lines are still starting California wildfires. We can’t wait three years for a fix,https://www.latimes.com/opinion/story/2019-11-29/fix-california-wildfires-utlities-and-fire-starting-power-lines,2019-11-29,"California faces a crisis that requires quick and effective action.
The destructive and dangerous fires that have always been part of life in the state are becoming even more so. Many of the most recent — and worst — of those fires have been started by downed or sparking power lines. Yet the best solution the state and the utility companies have come up with to prevent that is to shut down power preemptively to hundreds of thousands of households, often in a chaotic and disruptive manner. In October, as fire season began, the rollout of these “public safety power shut-offs” was a disaster.
This process has to be fixed. The damage to the state’s economy, not to mention the hardship, confusion and fear felt by millions of residents and businesses forced to endure days, even a week, without power, requires action.
It seems that Gov. Gavin Newsom understands the urgency. Instead of just complaining about the utilities’ lack of investment in safety measures or their failure to implement the shut-offs effectively, he has convened an “energy team,” headed by an “energy czar,” Ana Matosantos, charged with envisioning a new path for the state’s electrical grid. He also appointed a new president of the California Public Utilities Commission, Marybel Batjer, who, three months into the job, has already shown more regulatory teeth than her recent predecessors.
Both Matosantos and Batjer have vowed that next year won’t be as bad as this year. Here are some relatively short-term steps that can be taken to help.
Read the full series
First, the power lines must be made safer. Not in three or more years, as envisioned in the wildfire mitigation plans that the state’s electrical utilities were required to draw up this year. But starting this year.
Doing this will require some political will. But it is not impossible. We know how power lines start fires: Tree limbs are blown by high winds into overhead wires. Either they spark (the cause of the Getty fire) or they are knocked to the ground and set fire. In other cases, lines strung too close to each other slap together in high winds, causing them to arc and send sparks raining down on trees and bushes (the cause of the Thomas fire).
A good first step would be for the PUC, which regulates the state’s for-profit power companies such as Pacific Gas & Electric and Southern California Edison, to order an immediate inspection of all the power lines in the state, starting with those in the high-fire risk areas. The goal would be to identify potentially weak spots and come up with a prioritized list of fast fixes.
To be sure, this will not be cheap. But ratepayers and taxpayers are already on the hook for the billions of dollars needed to fund electrical safety upgrades outlined in the state’s wildfire mitigation plans and to cover insurance claims for property destroyed in fires ignited by power lines, to say nothing of the hundreds of millions of dollars that they spend on state and local fire agencies each year to fight wildfires and protect homes and lives. Smart investments now could save money down the road.
Also, we have to implement our power shut-offs better. What happened in October was an unforgivable mess.
And it was not hard to see it coming. When lawmakers gave their blessing to expanded outages    as a way to prevent power lines from setting fires, they didn’t require utilities to commit to any sort of shut-off criteria, such as a minimum wind speed that would have to be reached before the power could be cut. The only requirement was that power shut-offs be used as a last resort. The utilities officials said don’t worry, we know what we are doing. Trust us to figure out how to do it.
The problem with that became apparent almost as soon as PG&E and Edison, the state’s two largest investor-owned power companies, started warning the millions of people in their service areas that they might experience a  blackout. Maybe. We don’t know when. Or if. But be prepared. Just in case.Despite having months to get ready for that moment, neither PG&E or Edison adequately prepared for the inevitable onslaught of customers logging on or calling up to find out if they would be among those losing power. And then when the powerwasturned off, it seemed to be done randomly and not terribly effectively. For example, despite high winds, some power lines continued to be energized in risky areas. Some of them malfunctioned and are now suspected of setting the Kincade fire in Northern California and the Saddleridge, Getty and Maria fires in the Los Angeles area.
This doesn’t have to happen again. We know this because one investor-owned utility, San Diego Gas & Electric, has been employing preventive shut-offs for years as a way to avoid starting fires without leaving huge numbers of its 1.4 million customers in the dark for long periods of time. Indeed, during the red flag warnings between Oct. 9 and 11, PG&E turned off the power to some 730,000 customers, affecting 1.8 million people in 38 counties, while SDG&E shut off the power of only about400 of its customers. This was because after two devastating wildfire seasons in the 2000s, the utility had wisely invested in devices and technology to better predict dangerous conditions and to section off specific lines so effectively that it could shut down power to the windy end of one street and keep the lights on at the other end.
At the very least, regulators at the PUC must come up with minimum shut-off criteria. That could involve wind levels or the issuance of a red flag warning by the state or some other standard. But it can’t be left to the individual utilities alone to decide when a shut-off is appropriate.
And communications must be more narrowly targeted. If warnings become too common or go out too broadly, there’s a danger that people will ignore them and fail to prepare for when the lights really do go out.
Here’s another suggestion: If a power shut-off is determined to have been unjustified by the PUC, or larger in scale than necessary, then utilities should pay hefty fines that they can’t pass on to ratepayers.
Finally, let’s get moving to develop safe backup power sources. When the power was turned off to millions of Californians in October, untold numbers of backup diesel generators kicked on, for those Californians lucky or prepared enough to have one on hand. But though those gas-burning, carbon-belching generators may have kept the food from spoiling during the outages, they presented their own problems. For one thing, they are fire hazards themselves, and in fact they set several small fires in Northern California during the October power outages. They also emit greenhouse gases that foul the air, and they can kill people when used in improperly vented areas.
The best way of discouraging the use of diesel generators is to put a rush on something that the state has already been planning for: building small-scale local power generators fed by renewable sources such as the sun or wind, coupled with storage batteries that can be switched on when the grid is turned off.
Just a decade or so ago, deploying these types of backup generators in any meaningful way was still an unaffordable dream. But in the last few years battery storage technology has made huge leaps in both affordability and capacity.
It wouldn’t be a bad investment of taxpayer funds for the state to allocate some of its current budget surplus to buying backup solar power generating systems and battery storage systems, creating mini-microgrids in centrally located places, such as schools in high-fire risk communities, that could act as community power centers during public safety power shut-offs.
This isn’t the definitive list of things that need to be done to help California survive its inevitable fires, just a few short-term things that can reasonably be accomplished by the time peak fire season begins in 2020.

The clock is ticking on California’s next fire season. We need to get ready,https://www.latimes.com/opinion/story/2019-11-29/california-wildfire-season-prepare,2019-11-29,"Dangerous, destructive, seemingly apocalyptic wildfires have always been an element of life in California. Like earthquakes, they’re part of the deal people make to live in a state that also offers a culture of reinvention, extraordinary natural beauty and, much of the time, fabulous weather.
But fire season — those summer and fall months when humidity plummets and hot desert winds roar through canyons and mountain passes — has changed in recent years. It’s grown longer and more dangerous. Half of the state’s 20 most destructive fires have occurred in the last four years. And about 150 people have died in wildfires in California since 2015, about as many as were killed in wildfires in the previous 82 years.
Read the full series
There’s no mystery as to why. Climate change has exacerbated the state’s naturally dry and windy inclination even as humans have pushed development into historically risky areas, building homes and businesses in dry, vegetation-rich parts of the state and extending transmission lines to power them.
The power lines, the new development, the changing climate — this was a volatile situation even before the state’s utilities failed to invest in the technology, sometimes simple technology, that would have made their lines less vulnerable to sparking during the intensifying seasonal high winds. The combination, though, has been catastrophic. Power lines have ignited more than 2,000 wildfires just since 2014. Overall, seven of the 10 deadliest and most destructive fires in California were started by downed or sparking power lines or electrical equipment, including the Thomas fire in 2017 that was, at least until the following year, the largest wildfire in state history.And nothing in the state’s history compares with the past, terrible 12 months. First came the worst fire season on record, beginning in November 2018, and then, in October and November of 2019, there were deliberate power blackouts on an unprecedented scale. The outages were intended to stop fires but actually added to the chaos, confusion, cost and peril.
It can’t happen again. And the responsibility to make sure it doesn’t rests with California’s elected officials, regulators and utilities.
Now that the smoke has cleared and the winds have calmed, at least for the moment, it’s time for fast action — faster than government is used to moving. Even while continuing to work toward major long-term changes such as restructuring Pacific Gas & Electric, the state’s largest investor-owned utility, and building local renewable-energy systems, Californians will be looking to their leaders to show the appropriate urgency on safeguards that will be in place by the time peak fire season hits in 2020.
To that end, we talked to or heard from energy and land-use experts, state officials, legislators, utility executives, regulators, ratepayer advocates and others and came up with a few actions that can be reasonably begun over the next year in two critical areas — the state’s electrical grid and land use — to ensure that future fire seasons aren’t as dangerous and disruptive as the last.

"I-5 through Grapevine reopens, Cave fire fizzling out after snow and rain wallop Southern California",https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2019-11-28/interstate-5-through-the-grapevine-closed-by-snow-as-new-storm-pounds-southern-california,2019-11-29,"A powerful winter storm walloped Southern California on Thursday, coating high desert areas with heavy snowfall, causing intense downpours and flash flooding in coastal neighborhoods and twice forcing the closure of I-5 through the Grapevine.
I-5 UPDATE @ 9:30 PM:All SB I-5 lanes are now OPEN from Grapevine.CHP is beginning to escort vehicles on NB I-5.Thank you for your patience and drive slowly and carefully through the pass!https://t.co/jNnEDKusuO
All lanes reopened shortly after 9:30 p.m. But southbound lanes of the 15 Freeway remained closed Thursday night as drivers were warned to avoid the Cajon Pass area after a traffic collision.
The storm — produced by a cold front from the Gulf of Alaska — frustrated holiday travelers who found themselves crawling along alternative routes in sometimes icy conditions when the California Highway Patrol shut the main artery linking the state’s north and south for more than nine hours earlier Thursday.
More than 7 inches of snow fell in Pearblossom by noon while enough snow piled up in nearby Palmdale to snap tree branches, the National Weather Service said.
Farther south, the storm deluged Long Beach with more than 2 inches of rain, breaking the city’s previous record for the day set in 1970.
Still, some found a way to enjoy the spectacle of a white Thanksgiving Day and feel gratitude for a break in the recent dry conditions that have fueled destructive wildfires throughout the state.
In Santa Barbara County, Fire Department spokesman Mike Eliason stood alone  atop a ridge and surveyed the smoldering landscape of the Cave fire as snow began to fall.
“This is just really unique. We’ve never had fire withactive snowfall near the point of origin,” Eliason said. “It was a very thankful moment. Thankful that no one got injured, no one lost their home, that the snow came over heavy rain. And I’m just thankful that everybody got home safe.”
Some firefighters were allowed to return home as weather conditions helped bring the fire under control, he said.
The holiday’s chilly and gray conditions may seem worse than usual because they are such a sudden departure from earlier in the month, said climatologist Bill Patzert.
“It was weather whiplash — an abrupt change from hot and dry to unusually frigid. Like 0 to 60 in a Tesla,” Patzert quipped. “I think as far as the fire season, we can say R-I-P. ... There are quite a few storms lined up.”
A new winter storm is expected to arrive in Northern and Central California on Saturday, persist through the busy Sunday travel day and continue through Tuesday. It could hit Southern California by next Wednesday and Thursday. Satellites show even more rain could be lined up behind that.
Unlike this week’s storms, next week’s is expected to be fueled by an atmospheric river of subtropical moisture from the west — long plumes of water vapor that can pour over from the Pacific Ocean through California. As a result, there should be heavy precipitation, but it’s still too early to pinpoint  where rain and snow will be funneled.
“It’s kind of like a fire hose, which is hard to control,” said Carolina Walbrun, meteorologist with the National Weather Service’s Monterey office. “Right now, we’re confident that there’s going to be rain, and a lot of it, on Saturday afternoon through Sunday. Where the heaviest precipitation is going to be is still uncertain.”
Depending on what areas are affected by the atmospheric river, there could be concerns about mudslides for recently burned areas, such as the Kincade fire area of northern Sonoma County, which burned through very steep terrain.
“If that fire hose aims toward that burn scar,” Walbrun said, “we’re going to have some issues.”
Thursday’s storm was the second to hit the region this week.
At around 4:30 a.m. Thursday, authorities closed the I-5 through the Tejon Pass and urged motorists to use Highway 101 instead. Because the 101 is at a lower elevation, it generally doesn’t getenough snowto force a closure.
We are still clearing stuck vehicles and the snow is still falling.  We will provide an update when something changes.  We do not have an estimated time of reopening.  We will post and tweet when we do.  SR-58 is open but we recommend US-101 as the preferred detour.#Grapevinepic.twitter.com/tapGutB8sg
On the freeway just north of Lake Hughes Road, the California Department of Transportation began operating a new gate that allows drivers to turn around and travel back in the other direction when road conditions are dicey.
The 52-foot-long steel gate weighs 5 tons, and crews can open it by hand in less than two minutes. The gate enables drivers to avoid surface streets, which become congested when the freeway is closed, said Caltrans spokesman Eric Menjivar.
“We were pretty excited to get this new gate into use,” Menjivar said. “We think this ‘snow gate’ will help people get to where they need to get to.”
On the northern side of the Grapevine, Shell gas station assistant manager Abraham Diaz said his day was filled with a rotation of commuters stymied by the highway closure.
“Some are frustrated, some are upset. Some go, ‘You know what? Forget this. I’m going home,’” Diaz said.
The freeway was reopened for a few hours before authorities closed all lanes again about 8:20 p.m. They were reopened about an hour later.
The rains were suspected of playing a role in the creation of a sinkhole that forced the closure of a two-mile section of Turnbull Canyon Road in Whittier. The road was expected to be closed between Beverly Hills and Skyline drives until at least Monday.
In preparation for the storm, Los Angeles opened several emergency shelters, making 471 beds available through Friday. More than 1,200 are expected to open over the next month during the city’s annual winter roll-out.

At least 9,000 Southern California Edison customers found themselves without power at some point Thursday morning as the utility worked to fix utility equipment damaged by snow, company officials said. Among them were about 4,000 customers in Crestline in San Bernardino County, said Edison spokesman Robert Villegas. The rest were spread throughout the utility’s 50,000-square-mile territory.
Edison increased staffing and placed workers throughout its service area early to limit chances that repair crews would be cut off from customers due to mud or debris flows, Villegas said.
“We fully anticipate multiple days of stormy weather, so we have our crews working,” he said. “It’s always a tough thing on holidays for those who aren’t going to be home, but it’s a part of their job.”
Others found a good way to enjoy themselves away from home.
With the temperature in Palmdale in the 30s, Highland High School football coach Richard Lear gave his players the option of practicing inside or outside in preparation for their championship game on Saturday against North Torrance. Their answer: outside.
Linebacker Daniel Brown looked like a Marvel superhero ashe sent his body flying, cutting in half a snowman that had been built on the field.
“It wasn’t our most productive practice,” Lear said, “but might have been our funnest.”
Times staff writers Eric Sondheimer, Hailey Branson Potts, Anh Do, Paige St. John and Hannah Fry contributed to this report.

Judge keeps a California law on utilities paying fire damages,https://www.latimes.com/business/story/2019-11-27/bankruptcy-judge-keeps-california-law-utilities-fire-damages,2019-11-28,"SAN FRANCISCO —A federal bankruptcy court judge on Wednesday rejected Pacific Gas & Electric’s latest attempt to change a California law requiring utilities to pay for the devastation from wildfires ignited by their electrical equipment.
The decision issued byU.S. Bankruptcy Judge Dennis Montalipreserves a long-standing principle known as“inverse condemnation.”
The century-old law helped drive the nation’s largest utility into bankruptcy protection 10 months ago as it faced at least $20 billion in losses stemming from a series of deadly and destructive wildfires in 2017 and 2018.
The ruling is a victory for thousands of people who lost their homes and loved ones in the fires, as well as insurers trying to recover part of the roughly $16 billion they have already paid their policyholders.
In addition to using bankruptcy to reorganize its finances, PG&E hoped the process would enable it to shed the burden of inverse condemnation.
But Montali pointed out that there is no evidence yet that PG&E would not be allowed to pass along its wildfire costs if it could show regulators that it had acted as a “prudent operator.” He said PG&E seemed to be “seeking a solution, fire cost reimbursement, in search of a problem.”
In a statement, PG&E expressed disappointment with Montali’s reasoning before sounding a conciliatory note.
“We understand and appreciate that there are diverse opinions on this subject,” the company said. “We look forward to being engaged in discussions on these important issues to all Californians.”
Although utilities never liked the concept of inverse condemnation, it wasn’t crippling until recently. That’s because California’s power regulators typically allowed profit-driven utilities to recoup their fire losses by raising their rates — effectively forcing their customers to bear the burden instead of their stockholders.
That changed two years ago when California’s Public Utilities Commission rejected a request from San Diego Gas & Electric to pass along losses from a past fire to its customers. Regulators had determined the utility’s negligence in protecting and upgrading its electrical system played a key role in the fire.
That raised the specter of California utilities having to shoulder all the costs of future wildfires at a time when the blazes are growing more frequent and destructive amid climate change.
The shift in the regulatory landscape has been even more jarring because PG&E and other utilities put off maintenance on aging electrical systems. Those past decisions can now be interpreted as poor management or outright negligence after PG&E’s power grid was linked to several fires that destroyed thousands of homes and killed dozens of people.
With utilities no longer assured of passing along wildfire costs through higher rates, investors began to demand higher interest rates for the companies to borrow money. That, in turn, threatened to make it too expensive for PG&E to pay for the work to make its system safer and more reliable, which would hurt its 5 million customers in the long run.
“PG&E continues to believe that imposing strict liability without regard to fault under inverse condemnation is a flawed legal doctrine and bad for our customers, our economy and our state,“ the company said after the ruling.
PG&E also had tried to persuade the bankruptcy judge that the law was designed to serve as a “socialization of losses,” so it should always be allowed to recover its wildfire costs through higher rates.
During court hearings on the issue, Montali repeatedly questioned whether a federal bankruptcy judge should tinker with a liability standard that California lawmakers reviewed last summer and allowed to stand — underscoring it again in his written ruling.
PG&E could still appeal Montali’s decision but didn’t address whether it would in its initial statement.
Montali predicted the California Supreme Court also would spurn any attempt by the utility to skirt the law.

Rose Parade 2020: Overnight campers brave the cold to claim prime spots,https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2019-12-31/rose-parade-2020-overnight-campers-on-parade-route,2020-01-01,"As the temperature continued to drop Tuesday night, 18-year-old Brianna Zameza sat in a folding chair on Colorado Boulevard in Pasadena sniffing a jar of Vicks Vaporub, willing it to help ward off a cold.
The Pasadena local was determined to make her first time camping overnight on the sidewalk of a city awaiting its annual day in the national spotlight a success.
Each year, hundreds of campers flock the day before the Tournament of Roses Parade to the free curbside seating available on a first-come, first-served basis along three stretches along the 5 1/2-mile parade route.
With duct tape and chalk, they divide up the sidewalk, then stake their claim with camp chairs, wholesale packs of chips and fruit, sleeping bags, heavy blankets, puzzles and board games.
Zameza was full of hometown pride Tuesday evening as she reflected on a recent vacation to Laughlin, Nev., where she was surprised to find out locals there knew where Pasadena was.
“Once I said ‘Pasadena,’ they were, like, ‘Oh, that’s where the Rose Parade takes place,’” Zameza said. “And it made me see that this is something special, even beyond where I live.”
Many of the campers are veterans, well acquainted with what is often a chilly night, and they bring propane-powered portable heaters.
And some, such as Andrés Villagrana, a 15-year-old Pasadena resident who has attended the parade for as long as he can remember, bring fire pits and heaps of firewood.
Andrés and his cousin Diana Calderón, 18, were tasked Tuesday evening with watching over their family’s spot.
“The truth is you’re never completely asleep,” Calderón said. “It’s too exciting. So we all go to bed at 3 a.m. and wake up super early.”
What’s she most looking forward to? A particular float or band?
“Honestly, my favorite part of all this is just being here with family, throwing marshmallows at passing cars,” Calderón said.
People camp out along the parade route for a few reasons: to spend time with family and friends, stake out a good spot to watch the parade — and to engage in shenanigans.
Wearing a down jacket, Mardis Gras beads and a “Happy New Year” headband, Paulina Gault and her friends were busy pelting passing cars at the corner of Oakland Avenue and Colorado Boulevard with marshmallows and tortillas, and spraying vehicles with Silly String.
“We normally put shaving cream on the tortillas,” Gault, 21, of Pomona said, “to really make them stick.”
It’s a harmless Rose Parade tradition, she explained, noting that the police generally don’t have any issues with the pre-parade pranks.
“In fact,” Gault said, “sometimes you’ll see their cars covered in Silly String, too.”
An estimated 700,000 people attend the parade, which starts at 8 a.m. on New Year’s Day. The overnight campers come from near and far to get their seats.
Dan McGuire, 63, traveled from Saratoga, Wyo., to camp and attend the parade.
Whereas locals were quick to discuss how they planned to stay warm overnight, McGuire was unconcerned. Back home in Saratoga, a town that holds an annual ice fishing derby in January, overnight temperatures were expected to drop to 11 degrees Tuesday night.
McGuire, enjoying the much warmer weather, looked over as a row of gleaming, classic cars cruised down the street, and he grinned mischievously.
“They’re smart to come out now,” he said. “Come 9 o’clock, I’m whipping out the Silly String.”
Sporting a black 2020 Rose Parade baseball cap, LaTresa Harris, accompanied by two cousins and her two daughters, waited for night to fall while blasting Rihanna’s “Only Girl” on her speaker.
This is her second time camping out for the parade, and Harris woke up at 4 a.m. Tuesday to ensure she could claim her piece of sidewalk by 8 a.m.
Her daughters, ages 7 and 10, were absorbed playing video games on their phones.
“But when the sun goes down, and they close the street, they’re going to be up and down on their scooters,” Harris said.
The street closure, she explained, is what the children most look forward to, “because they’re free and they’re safe.”

California makes it easier to thin vegetation fueling wildfires. Will it make a difference?,https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2019-12-31/california-land-clearing-wildfire-prevention,2019-12-31,"SACRAMENTO —California regulators said Tuesday that they have streamlined the state’s permit process to speed up the approval of tree-thinning projects designed to slow massive wildfires that have devastated communities in recent years.
The state Board of Forestry and Fire Protection approved a vegetation management program based on more than a decade of analysis of the potential environmental damage from removing different types of fuel, ranging from alpine trees to chaparral.
That will allow new projects to use the preapproved environmental analyses rather than starting fresh each time to meet the requirements of California’s strict environmental laws.
Gov. Gavin Newsom equated it to the emergency orders he issued nearly a year ago to speed up approval of 35 forest management projects intended to help protect more than 200 communities in high-risk areas.
The orders suspended some requirements and regulations, which his office said reduced the usual three- to five-year timeline to less than a year while still protecting the environment.
The projects generally involve thinning or clearing trees or brush along wide paths near vulnerable communities so that wildfires slow down and can be contained while they move through areas with less fuel. Other projects aim to restore a more natural balance between fire and forests.
Critics say the fuel-thinning projects wouldn’t have slowed the wind-driven infernos that devastated communities in recent years and largely leveled the town of Paradise more than a year ago. Nor will they help with slower-moving forest fires unless the breaks in fuel are maintained for generations, they note, including by weeding out more flammable brush and grass that would naturally grow where trees are removed.
State regulators say they expect the streamlined process to create efficiencies that will help California eventually meet its goal of treating 500,000 acres of non-federal land annually. The state is responsible for more than 20 million acres of wildland, but the new program will not be used in considering plans for commercial timber harvests or residential development.
President Trump has repeatedly criticized the state’s Democratic leaders for not doing enough to manage forests to prevent wildfires.
Newsom’s office pointedly noted that the federal government owns nearly 58% of California’s forestland, while the state owns 3% and 40% is privately owned. The federal government is attempting to match the state’s goal of treating 500,000 acres each year.
“The scale of the wildfire crisis in California is unprecedented, and we need a response to match the scale and severity of this challenge,” Newsom said in a statement.

"Drones, fireworks, countdowns: Cities around the world ring in 2020",https://www.latimes.com/world-nation/story/2019-12-31/revelers-around-the-world-usher-in-the-new-decade,2020-01-01,"Revelers around the globe are bidding farewell to a decade that will be remembered for the rise of social media, the Arab Spring, the #MeToo movement and President Trump.
Here’s a look at how the world is ushering in 2020:
The Sunshine State’s hedonistic, subtropical island has six different “drops,” including a drag queen drop.

Fireworks burst and confetti fell in one of the world’s most watched New Year’s Eve spectacles.
Singapore stole the show on New Year’s Eve as 500 drones performed in unison, forming a clock, a planet, a diamond and a mythical Merlion, Singapore’s official mascot that has a lion’s head and a fish’s body.

The intricacy of the show, in which some drones got within 3 feet of one another, took a year to create, choreograph and produce, the Straits Times reported.

A joyful crowd of Parisians and tourists walked, biked and used scooters to reach the Champs-Elysees for New Year’s celebrations, in a city with almost no public transport amid massive strikes.

Revelers converged at the famous avenue to watch a light show at the Arc de Triomphe, followed by a fireworks display at midnight. Paris police set up a security perimeter around the Champs-Elysees area with a ban on alcohol and traffic restrictions.


All Metro lines in the French capital were closed except for two automatic lines, and only a few night buses were running, as Tuesday marked the 27th consecutive day of transport strikes against President Emmanuel Macron’s plans to overhaul the French pension system.

Hundreds of thousands of revelers were expected to ring in the new year in front of the Brandenburg Gate in Berlin while revelers celebrated around the country.
Several German cities including Munich and Hamburg have banned private fireworks amid concerns about the danger and environmental impacts from the increasingly powerful fireworks.


Snow bike races in Villars-sur-Ollon were held Tuesday to celebrate the new year at the St. Sylvestre Grand Prix, a ritual that has been going on for more than three decades. Participants rode their bikes down snow-covered ski slopes from the top of Roc d’Orsay to the center of the Villars resort, the race’s website says. A drone captured an image of cyclists and a hang-glider during the race.

Russians began the world’s longest continuous New Year’s Eve with fireworks and a message from President Vladimir Putin urging them to work together in the coming year.
Putin made the call in a short speech broadcast on television just before the stroke of midnight in each of Russia’s 11 time zones. The recorded message was followed by an image of the Kremlin Clock and the sound of its chimes. State TV showed footage of extensive festive fireworks in cities of the Far East.
But one holiday tradition was missing in Moscow this year — a picturesque layer of snow. The Russian capital has had an unusually warm December, and temperatures in central Moscow as midnight approached were just above freezing.

More than a million people descended on a hazy Sydney Harbor and surrounding areas to ring in the new year despite ongoing wildfires ravaging New South Wales, Australia’s most populous state.
Some communities have canceled New Year’s fireworks celebrations, but Sydney Harbor’s popular display was granted an exemption to the fireworks ban in place there and elsewhere to prevent new wildfires.

"Death toll rises as Australian wildfires burn on, with no rain in sight",https://www.latimes.com/world-nation/story/2019-12-31/raging-wildfires-trap-4-000-at-australian-towns-waterfront,2020-01-01,"PERTH, Australia —Wildfires burning across Australia’s two most populous states Tuesday trapped residents of a seaside town in apocalyptic conditions and killed at least two people while more property along the country’s east coast fell victim to a devastating fire season.
About 4,000 residents in the southeastern town of Mallacoota in Victoria state fled toward the water Tuesday morning as winds pushed a  wildfire toward their homes. The smoke-filled sky shrouded the town in darkness before turning an unnerving shade of bright red.
Australia’s annual wildfire season, which peaks during the Southern Hemisphere summer, started early after an unusually warm and dry winter. Record-breaking heat and windy conditions triggered devastating wildfires in New South Wales and Queensland states in September.
About 12.35 million acres of land have burned nationwide over the last few months, with 12 people confirmed dead and more than 1,000 homes destroyed. Nearly 100 fires were burning across the state of New South Wales, which is home to Sydney.
New South Wales state Rural Fire Services Commissioner Shane Fitzsimmons said this wildfire season is the worst on record and painted a bleak long-term picture.
“We’ve seen extraordinary fire behavior,” he said Tuesday. “What we really need is meaningful rain, and we haven’t got anything in the forecast at the moment that says we’re going to get drought-breaking or fire-quenching rainfall.”
The wildfire crisis has reignited debate about whether Prime Minister Scott Morrison’s conservative government has taken enough action on climate change. Australia is the world’s largest exporter of coal and liquefied natural gas.
Morrison, whom critics have deemed a climate change skeptic, conceded  last month that “climate change along with many other factors” has contributed to the wildfires.
The prime minister took criticism for going on a family vacation to Hawaii in December during the crisis. He eventually cut his trip short and publicly apologized.
Late Tuesday, Mallacoota was saved by changes of wind direction, but authorities said “numerous” homes were lost. Residents returning home were urged to boil tap water before drinking it. Forest Fire Management Victoria said the wildfires had put heavy demands on tap water that are affecting supplies.
Stranded residents and vacationers were reported to be sleeping in cars on New Year’s Eve, while gas stations and surf clubs transformed into evacuation areas.
Victoria state Premier Daniel Andrews had earlier announced plans to evacuate the trapped people by sea. There were grave fears for four missing people. “We can’t confirm their whereabouts,” Andrews told reporters Tuesday.
Andrews has requested assistance from 70 firefighters from the United States and Canada, while Australia’s military sent air and sea reinforcements.
Victoria Emergency Services Commissioner Andrew Crisp confirmed “significant” property losses across the region. More than 115 communities in Victoria remained under emergency warnings Tuesday night.
Some communities canceled New Year’s fireworks celebrations, but Sydney’s popular display over its iconic harbor controversially went ahead in front of more than a million revelers. The city was granted an exemption to a total fireworks ban in place there and elsewhere to prevent new wildfires.
Fire conditions in Victoria and New South Wales worsened after oppressive heat Monday mixed with strong winds and lightning.
Police in New South Wales said Tuesday that two men — a 63-year-old father and 29-year-old son — died in a house in the wildfire-ravaged southeast town of Cobargo, and a 72-year-old man remained missing.
“They were obviously trying to do their best with the fire as it came through in the early hours of the morning,” New South Wales Police Deputy Commissioner Gary Worboys said. “The other person that we are trying to get to, we think that person was trying to defend their property in the early hours of the morning.”
On Monday, a firefighter was killed when extreme winds flipped his truck. Samuel McPaul, 28, was the third volunteer firefighter in New South Wales to have died in the last two weeks. He was an expectant father.
More than 130 fires remain burning across New South Wales, with five at an emergency level. Authorities warned that power would be out for 24 hours along the fire-ravaged south coast of the state.

"Across the U.S., states are bracing for more climate-related disasters",https://www.latimes.com/world-nation/story/2020-01-30/states-climate-disasters,2020-01-31,"WASHINGTON —State lawmakers across the country are calling for huge investments to mitigate the effects of wildfires, flooding, hurricanes, droughts and other natural disasters made more devastating and frequent by climate change.
Following the hottest decade on record, which saw record-breaking wildfires in the West, extreme weather events like Superstorm Sandy, a years-long drought in California, and severe flooding in the Midwest, legislators in many states say it’s long past time to treat such events as the new normal — and invest accordingly.
“We’re going to see more and more of these impacts as the years go on,” said California state Sen. Ben Allen (D-Santa Monica). “We either invest in efforts on the ground right now or we pay a lot more down the line.”
The federal government is looking ahead as well. The Department of Housing and Urban Development is operating a $16-billion program to help coastal states prepare for natural disasters, a shift from the typical funding model of providing money after disasters have happened.
Even states whose leaders don’t publicly acknowledge the existence of climate change, such as Texas and South Carolina, have applied for federal dollars citing “changing coastal conditions” or “unpredictability,” the New York Times reported.
Texas wants to invest the federal money in flood control, removing homes from high-risk areas and helping local governments pay for projects. The state last year put more than $3 billion from its rainy-day fund toward flood control.
Louisiana hopes to use federal dollars to better map flooding areas. The state already is undertaking its own sweeping plan to limit development and move residents out of areas most prone to flooding, while improving infrastructure in communities on higher ground that are likely to receive displaced populations from neighboring towns. In New Orleans, leaders will be spending $500 million on infrastructure upgrades over the next five years, after residents in 2019 voted to authorize a bond to address flooding and other concerns.
“There’s more of an appetite among states for action, because there’s an increase in the disasters that we’re seeing,” said Beth Gibbons, executive director of the American Society of Adaptation Professionals, an organization dedicated to climate resilience work.
Jim Murley serves as the chief resilience officer for Miami-Dade County, which is experiencing flooding caused by sea level rise and increased hurricane threats. Planning for climate change, he said, is a different beast than typical government work.
“Most of what government does is thinking three to five years ahead,” he said. “[With climate change] we seriously have to think about 2040, 2060, 2100 — that doesn’t happen. We don’t do that for transportation planning, water planning — anything. You have to deal with a lot of uncertainty while at the same time believing the science is taking you on some path among these scenarios.”
Florida’s first chief resilience officer, appointed last year by Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis, is surveying what local governments are doing to develop best practices that can be employed statewide.
Some states’ proposals would borrow massive amounts of money to pay for future work, create new surcharges to bankroll permanent disaster accounts, or shift development away from areas prone to disaster. All those plans would come at a cost to state budgets or taxpayers, but supporters say the spending is necessary.
In some states, critics have argued that proposals represent excessive government spending or would inflict economic hardships on residents. Others have countered that some measures don’t go far enough.
Under the status quo, California is projected to face financial liabilities of $100 billion annually by 2050 because of climate change, said Allen, the state senator. That’s why he is proposing a climate bond, borrowing more than $4 billion to help prevent wildfires and droughts, shore up drinking water and protect coastlines. The bond would cover a wide variety of projects, some of which would get underway almost immediately, with others to be identified over time.
By investing in resilience projects over the next 10 to 15 years, Allen said, the state would be better prepared for inevitable future disasters. He said California lawmakers have expressed interest in his bill, which would need to pass the state Legislature before being sent to voters for approval.
Some Republicans have voiced opposition, including state Assemblyman James Gallagher of Yuba City, who told the Associated Press the state should pay for the work within its existing budget rather than borrowing more money.
Allen, though, thinks the growing challenges require additional long-term investment. “Anybody who’s thinking about the state of affairs in California right now in terms of any of these problems — wildfires, drought, mudslides, sea level rise — understands that any one of these incidents are part of a broader trend,” Allen said. “Unfortunately, this is the new normal.”
In Washington state, Commissioner of Public Lands Hilary Franz is leading the push for a bill that would establish a dedicated account to help prevent and fight wildfires. A new surcharge on home and auto insurance policies, estimated to cost the average household $1 a month, would raise an estimated $63 million a year.
“We’re finding increasing numbers of wildfires; we’re seeing an increasing geographical area for those wildfires,” Franz said. “We cannot afford to be complacent or think those are anomalies. ... We currently spend on average $153 million a year fighting wildfires. I’d rather be putting $63 million a year toward reducing catastrophic fires.”
Begging lawmakers each year for money for forest health projects and wildfire response resources has usually yielded “zero,” she said. The dedicated account would pay for new resources like additional firefighters, trucks and a helicopter, as well as bankroll the state’s plan to treat forests that have grown too dense and are filled with diseased and dying trees. Franz’s proposal has Democratic sponsors in both chambers, while Gov. Jay Inslee, also a Democrat, has not yet weighed in. Franz said it wouldn’t be easy to pass the bill over likely opposition from the insurance lobby.
While climate change is shifting conditions in coastal areas, it’s also making the West drier, increasing the likelihood of more frequent and severe droughts. Last year, seven Western states signed, and Congress approved, an agreement to use less water from the Colorado River. Limits go into effect when the water falls below certain levels. Regional leaders say much more work remains to prepare for drier conditions under climate change.
In New York and South Carolina, legislators will consider bills that would prepare for disaster by pushing people to get out of nature’s way. New York put hundreds of millions of dollars into buyouts for homes flooded during Superstorm Sandy. A proposal from state Sen. Joseph Griffo, a Republican, would establish a dedicated fund for buyouts — including in his upstate, inland Mohawk Valley district.
“We need to now have a permanent program in place under an existing agency of the state,” Griffo said. “Right now, we’re reacting, and we’ve done a fairly good job, but it’s case by case. Because this is occurring more regularly, let’s put some more structure together.”
Under his bill, residents whose homes flood repeatedly could lobby their local government to designate the area a flood zone and ask for state money to buy them out and return the land to its natural state. He said the bill has drawn interest, but legislators may need some convincing to approve more state spending despite a $6-billion budget deficit.
South Carolina coastal areas that are prone to flooding and sea level rise have developed rapidly. That has led to a “vicious cycle” in which taxpayers end up paying for disaster relief to rebuild homes that will flood again, said state Sen. Stephen Goldfinch, a Republican.
Such homes can be eligible for buyouts from the Federal Emergency Management Agency, but the homeowner must cover 25% of the cost. Goldfinch has filed a bill that would provide zero-interest state loans for homeowners who don’t have the money on hand to meet the FEMA requirement. He’s hoping for $5 million from the state to get the program underway.
“We’ve experienced unprecedented flooding for five or six years now,” Goldfinch said. “If you add up all the repair costs of fixing a home five or six times, the buyout’s a better solution.”
In Pennsylvania, state Sen. Jay Costa, a Democrat, said climate change is leading to more-frequent landslides in his district, including a major highway collapse in 2018.
“The amount of rain we’ve been experiencing,” he said, “there are communities that have suffered significant landslides that have resulted because of the freeze-thaw cycle that’s here and the changes that have occurred in our weather.”
Costa has proposed a bill to create a state-backed landslide insurance program, while also establishing an assistance fund. The fund would give grants or loans for remediation and stabilization work, while the insurance program would allow homeowners to get coverage that is currently either difficult or expensive to obtain. Both programs would start with $2.5 million.
Costa has introduced the same legislation for several years, and he’s waiting to see whether it gets traction in the Legislature in 2020, or whether it will get rolled into Democratic Gov. Tom Wolf’s Restore Pennsylvania plan to address infrastructure needs.
In some coastal areas, there is a debate over whether to remove development from low-lying areas or to invest in costly sea walls. New York City is considering several plans to address flooding, including a $119-billion offshore sea wall that could protect the coast from storm surges but not high tides or storm runoff.
Even that ambitious project, some critics say, does not adequately account for current projections of sea level rise. Federal and state money from both New York and New Jersey likely would be required to pay for the project.
Boston, however, recently scrapped its plans for a sea wall. Instead, Mayor Marty Walsh, a Democrat, envisions using local, state and federal money plus private investment to convert many of the city’s flood-vulnerable areas into parks and green space.
Many states and cities are facing similar questions in 2020, deciding which locations have an urgent need for protection from rising waters, and which areas — like parts of the Florida Keys — are too expensive to save.
Superstorm Sandy flooded a pair of electrical substations in New Jersey, leaving part of state Assemblyman Sean Kean’s district without power for two weeks. Kean, a Republican, questioned the location of the substations, one near the ocean and one near a river. He is now pushing a proposal that would require utilities to have flood mitigation plans.
“We need to force the utilities to take the proper action,” he said.
New Jersey announced this week that it will require builders to factor in sea level rise and other effects of climate change to get their projects approved, making it the first state to do so. The regulation is expected to go into place by 2022, forcing developers to consider the long-term implications of climate change, especially for projects along the state’s 130 miles of coastline.
Lawmakers in Maine will be closely watching the work of the Maine Climate Council, which the Legislature established last year to come up with recommendations to reduce the state’s greenhouse gas emissions and prepare for climate change.
Democratic state Rep. Lydia Blume’s proposed commission to assess hazards to coastal communities caused by climate change was incorporated into the council’s mission.
“The idea is that we’re not just waiting for a disaster,” Blume said. “We’re anticipating that we need to make changes so we’re more resilient going forward.”
The council is expected to recommend proposals this year.
States also may find it harder to borrow money for future projects if they don’t demonstrate now that they’re thinking ahead about climate change. Credit rating firms such as Moody’s Investors Service have said they are considering the effects of climate change, meaning governments that don’t prepare could see their credit ratings downgraded.
BlackRock, a firm that manages more than $7 trillion in investments, said this month that it would make future decisions based on environmental sustainability, signaling an increased awareness in the financial sector of the effects of climate change.
Gibbons, the adaptation expert, highlighted Minnesota as a leader in climate planning, noting that the state now requires local governments to incorporate projected conditions in their hazard mitigation plans. She noted that most disaster money comes from the federal level and is disbursed after calamities take place. States, she said, need to advocate to change that model.

California’s super-dry February raises specter of early fires and drawn-down reservoirs,https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2020-02-29/californias-super-dry-february-raises-specter-of-early-wildfires-and-a-new-drought,2020-02-29,"California is set to conclude one of its driest Februaries in recorded history, elevating fears the state’s always-unpredictable fire season could arrive early this year — if March doesn’t provide some wet relief.
February is typically a prime month for Pacific storms to produce much of the Sierra Nevada snowpack — moisture that sustains wildlife, delays wildfire season and serves as a water bank for thirsty cities and farms. But those storms didn’t arrive in February, with astate surveyThursday showing the snowpack was 46%  of average.
After an unusually wet winter last year, many of California’s reservoirs are well above their season average, so state water managers have few fears about near-term shortages. Yet if the coming months remain relatively dry, the state will be dependent on an uncertain future to prevent the state from swinging back into drought conditions.
“All it takes is an extreme atmospheric river to end up in a high-water situation even if the broader season is dry,”  said state hydrologist Michael Anderson, who added that  a storm is expected to hit the state in the next couple of weeks. “The two extremes can now coexist in a warmer climate.”
Historical data, however, suggests there is just a small likelihood of what some call a “March Miracle.”
Over the last 14 decades, only five of the 20 driest Februaries in downtown Los Angeles were followed by Marches with above-average rainfall,  said Bill Patzert, a retired climatologist for the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in La Cañada-Flintridge. San Francisco follows a similar pattern, with only six of 18 relatively dry Februaries leading to above-average March rainfall since 1852,  said Jan Null, a meteorologist with Golden Gate Weather Services.
“You’re running out of time,” said meteorologist David Miskus, who authored the federal government’s most recent U.S. Drought Monitor report on Thursday. “It’d be nice to get a near-normal March, but it looks like you might have to wait until next season.”
For now, the effects of the dry February can be seen from space — in satellite photos that capture the barren Sierra, and at the region’s ski resorts, desperate for fresh powder. They also can be seen across the state’s ranch lands — where cattle seeking fields of green grass shoots are finding dust instead.
It has not rained at all in downtown Sacramento in February, making it the driest February on record there in 153 years of record-keeping. The second-driest February was in 1899, when it rained four-tenths of an inch. Though it did rain there in January, it amounted to less than half the monthly average.
The lack of rain has also meant fewer clouds, which can act as insulation for the region. Without them, February’s average high temperature was 67.6 degrees, or more than 6 degrees warmer than normal for the month, said National Weather Service meteorologist Eric Kurth. Conversely, fewer clouds have also made it colder than average at night.
The situation is similar in San Francisco, where the city’s downtown hasn’t had any measurable precipitation since late January, marking one of the longest streaks of dry winter days since the peak of the drought in 2015.
“It seems like you guys either get feast or famine,” Miskus said from his Maryland office. “I guess the normal is to be abnormal.”
Because of the enduring dryness, Cal fire will  probably begin staffing  its seasonal firefighters and inmate hand crews earlier than last year, when an exceptionally soggy winter was capped with a surprise storm in May, said Mike Mohler, spokesman for the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection.
A new slate of fuel-reduction and fire break projects are lined up for 2020 to continue last year’s surge of work aimed at protecting rural communities and evacuation routes.
“It’s a double-edged sword — lots of rain, lots of brush; no rain, dry brush,” Mohler said. “We hate to preach doom and gloom, but it’s the reality we live in.”
The writing of what could come is already on the wall, Mohler said. A six-acre brush fire broke out at San Bruno Mountain State and County Park south of San Francisco on Friday, the smoldering remnants of a prescribed fire in Mendocino County grew out of control earlier this week, and  there was a 100-acre fire near Lake Tahoe in mid-February.
After back-to-back catastrophic fire years, 2019 ended up being the quietest year of wildfires in California since 2011, possibly because the state’s largest utilities proactively shut down their power lines most vulnerable to wind events. The strategy triggered blackouts for millions of customers but also potentially prevented some blazes from igniting during high winds.
In Southern California, where the fire season typically begins at the end of summer, the uneventful winter just gives the landscape that much more time to dry out, officials said. When the month is over, this February will probably rank as the 10th-driest on record for downtown Los Angeles, said meteorologist Joe Sirard of the National Weather Service.
Though a small storm is forecast for the first week of March, experts say it’s nowhere near big enough to make up for the our liquid deficit.
Patzert says our water deficit and drought goes back further than people think, evidenced by many of California’s groundwater wells. He pointed to the the Baldwin Park Key Well in the San Gabriel Valley Municipal Water District, which hit an all-time low in 2018 and remains below its historic average.
Based on the 143 years of records available, Patzert says the wet winters of 2016-17 and 2018-19 were the exceptions, not the rule, for California’s rain future.
Over that time frame, the average annual rainfall in downtown Los Angeles has been 14.93 inches. Based on that average, the 20-year period from 1999 to 2019 was more than 2 inches below that.
Another disturbing trend is earlier melt-off of Sierra snow. California’s snowpack melted an inch just in February because of warmer-than-typical weather, officials said.
“What we see in California is the snowpack comes later, it leaves earlier,” Patzert said. “We shifted the seasons. Warmer falls, warmer springs. And so droughts are now hotter. They’re normal, but they’re hotter.”

Westlands Water District gets permanent U.S. contract for massive irrigation deliveries,https://www.latimes.com/environment/story/2020-02-28/westlands-water-district-gets-permanent-u-s-contract-for-massive-irrigation-deliveries,2020-02-29,"The Interior Department on Friday awarded the nation’s largest farm water district a permanent entitlement to annual irrigation deliveries that amount to roughly twice as much water as the nearly 4 million residents of Los Angeles use in a year.
Gaining a permanent contract for so much cheap Central Valley Project water representsa major milestone for Westlands Water District,which supplies some of the state’s wealthiest growers and has long-standing ties to Interior Secretary David Bernhardt.
But the new pact, which would take effect June 1, provides no refuge for Westlands from California’s acrimonious water wars.
The district, which has rarely received its full contract amount in recent decades, will remain low in the federal project’s pecking order and will continue to be among the first cut in times of shortage.
The deal won’t end battles over the environmental impacts of massive water diversions from the source of Westlands’ supplies, Northern California’s Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta.
The contract won’t change the fact that about half of the district’s land is plagued by bad drainage and laced withnaturally occurring selenium that can poison wildlifewhen it accumulates in wastewater from Westlands’ irrigated fields.
And it won’t head off more lawsuits from critics who scored legal points in challenges of Westlands similarly-sized, short-term contracts.
The district is one of more than 75 Central Valley Project customers — most of them farm irrigation districts — that are taking advantage of a 2016 law to convert water service contracts that require periodic renewalto agreements that permanently lock in delivery entitlements and other terms.
The U.S. Bureau of Reclamation, which runs the federal project, also signed permanent contracts on Friday with a handful of municipal districts that it supplies.
“Completing these contracts is a big win-win for our contractors and the American public,” regional reclamation director Ernest Conant said in a statement. “The federal government will receive early payment of over $200 million, which Congress directed should be used for much-needed storage projects.”
The 2016 Water Infrastructure Improvements for the Nation Act,known as the WIIN Act,opened the door for reclamation contractors across the West to get permanent contracts if they repaid what they still owe U.S. taxpayers for construction of a federal water project.
The Central Valley Project is the largest water supply system in the country. Conceived in the 1930s and built over the next several decades by the federal government, the network of tall dams, big reservoirs and wide canals stretches 450 miles from the Redding region to Bakersfield.
The project’s supply of cheap, government subsidized water helped turn the arid scrublands of the San Joaquin Valley into a highly productive and profitable food factory.
That much of the water flows to the fields of large growers and agricultural corporations rather than the small family farms envisioned in the 1902 Reclamation Act has made the project the subject of periodic reform attempts and enduring criticism.
There is no project contractor as controversial as Westlands, which covers more than 1,000 thinly-populated square miles on the San Joaquin Valley’s sun-soaked west side. The district started taking federal irrigation deliveries in the 1960s.
California
The signs appear about 200 miles north of Los Angeles, tacked onto old farm wagons parked along quiet two-lane roads and bustling Interstate 5.
Westlands has a history of filing lawsuits to block endangered species protections that have curbed delta deliveries. Bernhardt — who for years represented Westlands as a Washington lawyer and lobbyist before joining the Trump administration  — argued one of those cases.
To foes, the district’s huge water contract, legacy of tainted field drainage and circumvention of federal reclamation law are emblematic of the shortcomings of federal irrigation policy.
When large landowners in Westlands broke up their holdings to meet acreage limits on the delivery of taxpayer-subsidized water, the cropland was often spread among extended family members and their trusts.
Westlands says it supplies700 “family-owned multi-generational farms,” with an average size of 875 acres — which is under the 960-acre limit. But University of California researchers in 2011 found 350 farm networks “grouped by common ownership.”
Growers will no longer have to worry about such restrictions, which are dropped when contractors pay off their construction debt.
Last year Westlands general managerTom Birmingham said the district owed the government $320.5 million.In response to recent questions from The Times, the reclamation bureau said that sum represented Westlands construction debt as of  September 2016.
Westlands’ payments since then have whittled the remaining debt to an estimated $202 million, said Shane Hunt, acting public affairs officer for the bureau.
Fishing and environmental groups have for years contended that the federal government should cut the size of Westlands’ contract, which at 1.15 million acre-feet is the largest in the Central Valley Project network.
They argue that Westlands has already taken roughly 100,000 acres out of production because of drainage problems and water shortages, and may have to retire more cropland.
They further note that neither the district nor the federal government has adopted a program to fully deal with selenium-tainted wastewater from Westlands fields, which in the early 1980s poisoned waterfowl at the Kesterson National Wildlife Refuge.
The groups won a favorable court ruling in 2016, when the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals said the reclamation bureau should have considered reducing the contract quantity when it renewed a series of short-term Westlands contracts. That case is still pending and may be rendered moot by the new pact.
Reclamation officials have said they do not have to conduct a review of the environmental impacts of granting permanent contracts because the WINN Act directs the agency to issue them.
Not so, said attorney Stephan Volker, who represents tribal and salmon fishing groups who filed earlier challenges. “We will be in court again and I’m optimistic that we will overturn that unlawful approval,” he said.
“The Bureau of Reclamation has never conducted an adequate [environmental] review that would identify the host of devastating impacts on the delta and its fish and wildlife that results in taking 1.2 million acre feet annually out of that beleaguered system and giving it to corporate farmers to apply to poisoned lands,” Volker argued.
Birmingham said last year that even if the district took a third of its 600,000 acres out of production, growers who have expanded plantings of almond and pistachio trees would continue to need full deliveries.
He also dismissed suggestions that the permanent entitlement positions the district to go into the water sales business.
“To date Westlands hasn’t sold any water outside of its district. We don’t sell the water for a handsome profit,” he said.

Small brush fire in Bay Area punctuates Northern California’s driest February on record,https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2020-02-28/small-fire-as-northern-california-heads-to-driest-february-on-record,2020-02-28,"SAN FRANCISCO —A six-acre brush fire slowly burned Friday at San Bruno State and County Park south of San Francisco — a blaze highly unusual for this time of year, in what should be the middle of the rainy season, officials said.
No evacuations were ordered, but the sight of a wildfire at this time of year in the Bay Area is extremely rare.
“That we’re seeing *any* wildfire activity in northern California is extremely unusual — let alone this kind of very active fire behavior currently occurring <10 miles from downtown San Francisco,” tweeted Daniel Swain, climatologist with UCLA, the National Center for Atmospheric Research and the Nature Conservancy.

Northern California is facing its driest February on record, and areas of California already have relatively dry vegetation. The Bay Area has also been remarkably warm in recent days, with San Francisco International Airport reaching 76 degrees on Thursday, breaking the record of 75 degrees for that date set in 1992.
The fire, reported about 10 a.m. Friday, was burning near a picnic area and by the afternoon, firefighters had a control line surrounding the fire.  A California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection helicopter made water drops, and smoke was visible across San Mateo County, officials said.
“This is an unusual time of year for a wildfire. This is a STARK REMINDER that we need to be prepared!,” tweeted Cal Fire’s San Mateo-Santa Cruz unit.
The North County Fire Authority, which handles fires for Brisbane, Daly City and Pacifica, said 60 firefighters were on the scene.

A wet spell may soon come. The National Weather Service said there’s a slight to moderate chance of heavy precipitation across much of California during the second week of March.

Did CBS backpedal on overtime pay plan? Why assistants are fuming,https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/business/story/2020-03-31/did-cbs-backpeddle-on-overtime-pay-plan-why-assistants-are-fuming,2020-04-01,"The backlash was swift.
Early on Tuesday, CBS sent out emails to assistants working on shows from affiliated producers informing them that the studio was no longer going to pay for overtime and that it was retroactively cutting overtime hours already approved and submitted.
The news spread like wildfire after recipients shared screenshots of the emails onsocial media, broadcasting their dismay about a move that was estimated to cut their pay by some 30%.
Just hours after the furor erupted, CBS issued a correction. A second email was sent out to assistants working for producers and writers with deals at CBS Studios that were targeted with the original emails to “correct” and “clarify” the initial notifications. CBS said there was, in fact, no plan to cap hours or retroactively change pay, according to emails reviewed by The Times.
“It was a mistake and it has been corrected,” a network spokesman said via email.
At a time whenHollywood production has ground to a halt, leaving tens of thousands of workers unemployed, the initial notice triggered panic among assistants, some of whom said they could lose more than $400 in weekly pay. Many earn close to the minimum wage.
“I immediately went into panic mode,” said one assistant, who asked not to be named for fear of reprisal. “My mind raced with worries about rent, car payments, student loans, everything. Most assistants, myself included, don’t make enough money to be able to save for times like these, so it feels terrible to have that rug pulled out from under you.”
Hollywood studios and media conglomerates facemounting losses as a result of stalledproductions and many may be looking at ways to cut costs. Theater chains andother companies have already hadto reduce staffing.
“I don’t necessarily believe this was an error,” said another assistant who asked not be identified. “I just think they didn’t expect any blowback.”
Screenshots of the emails first surfaced onTwitter, with writers sharing them using the hashtag #payuphollywood, an online movement that has been fighting for the rights of Hollywood assistants in recent months.
Hollywood Inc.
After years of low wages and abuse, Hollywood assistants are in open revolt over their treatment.
The furor began Tuesday morning when a CBS Television Studios development analyst emailed a group of assistants notifying them that for the week ending April 4 they would be paid for 40 hours — even if they had approval to file for more. Overtime from the previous week, ending March 28, would be cut to 52 hours, according to emails. An executive in production then sent out a second email stating that “starting 4/4/2020 all time cards should be turned in with only 40 hours,” adding that no overtime would be approved.
By Tuesday, afternoon, however,  CBS human resources executive Ellen Goldsmith sought to “correct” and “clarify” the earlier communications. Goldsmith said there were, in fact, no such plans to limit or cap the hours to 40 hours per week for assistants working for producers.
“We are continuing to require written pre-approval for any hours worked in excess of 52 hours per week,” Goldsmith wrote. She added that workers would be paid in accordance with California law and “there has been no instruction or intention to reduce your pay for hours worked retroactively.”
UnderCalifornialaw, employees must receive 11/2times the regular rate of pay for all hours worked over eight hours in any workday and over 40 hours in the workweek. It is alsoillegalto retroactively change compensation.
“We’re glad that CBS has clarified that rumored cuts to assistant pay were erroneous,” said writers Liz Alper and Deirdre Mangan, the two activists who founded #payuphollywood, in a joint statement. “With shelter-in-place restrictions across the world, viewers are turning tobroadcast and streaming in record numbers.Now is the time for studios and networks to be stepping up to protect their most vulnerable employees. We risk losing a generation of creatives who include those from underrepresented groups that can not afford more exclusion.”
The group has been raising money throughGoFundMe to provide stipendsto those in need during the COVID-19 crisis.
“We urge all corporations to continue paying support staffers their full wage and preserve Hollywood’s current class of apprentices,” they wrote.

California’s wildfires aren’t going to stay quarantined for coronavirus,https://www.latimes.com/opinion/story/2020-03-31/editorial-when-coronavirus-and-fire-risks-collide,2020-03-31,"Remember wildfires? With the  COVID-19 pandemic sucking up all the oxygen in the news cycle, it’s easy to forget that there are other threats to public safety out there.
The state’s power companies have not forgotten, however. They are under the gun to make to their power lines safer and less likely to spark before the next fire season rolls around — or face dire financial consequences. Sparking power lines are a common cause of wildfires.
But Southern California Edison officials say that the County of Los Angeles and a handful of communities in high-fire-risk areas are standing in their way, suspending or denying permits needed to initiate work if it involves power outages for local residents.
Government officials counter that they are open to exploring ways to do wildfire safety work that’s less disruptive for residents stuck at home during the  pandemic. But power outages in the middle of an emergency like this one are a bad idea, they say. They add that Edison officials haven’t been flexible or particularly communicative, and as a result they have had little choice but to say no.
Meanwhile, the California Public Utilities Commission has directed the utilities and local officials to iron out their differences so that the work can be done.
We agree. Just because wildfires aren’t as immediate a threat to public safety as the coronavirus, they soon will be — and may be even worse than usual thanks to a dry winter. We get that it’s a terrible time to cut off power, even for a few hours, for people instructed not to go out. Their freezers and fridges are stocked with food and many are now working or learning from home.
But suspending the upgrades could cause much more than just a few hours of disruption down the road. Edison said it has already decided to defer regular maintenance and focus on projects critical for safety, such as replacing transformers nearing the end of their natural life and insulating power lines so they don’t start fires. If Edison doesn’t do this now, it increases the risk of unplanned outages and wildfires later. And we can never forget that the deadliest and most destructive wildfires in recent years were ignited by sparking or malfunctioning power lines and equipment.
So this work must go on, but Edison shouldn’t run roughshod over local officials who have legitimate responsibility to protect residents. The utility must be willing to keep power disruptions to a minimum, by working at night or on weekends as much as possible, and it must help line up sources of backup power and communicate proactively with both customers and the elected officials who represent them.

Letters to the Editor: California got rid of surplus ventilators and mobile hospitals? Outrageous,https://www.latimes.com/opinion/story/2020-03-31/california-got-rid-of-surplus-ventilators-mobile,2020-03-31,"To the editor:Disposing of more than $200 millionin what are now hard-to-replace pandemic response supplies in order to save up to $5.8 million annually is a political travesty deserving of as deep a public investigation as any other serious misdeed of this century.
This is a classic case of what happens when one party is in control of government — either party — and there is no effective loyal opposition to raise red flags and halt ill-advised, short-term financial Band-Aids that push the dire consequences into the future.
Maintaining good government is often not a sexy topic, and voters often fail to appreciate intelligent foresight over headline-grabbing, knee-jerk reactions. They do so at their own peril, as we see now.
If there isn’t a ventilator available for you, call your legislator and ask why.
Mike Post, Winnetka
..
To the editor:Once again, we fail to maintain peak load capacity for a recurring problem. This time it is the COVID-19 pandemic. We know that epidemics occur from time to time and we should be ready.
The same failure to prepare affects California’s ability to deal with regular wildfires. If we maintained peak load capacity, we could keep 100-acre fires from becoming 100,000-acre fires.
This November, let’s hold all our elected officials accountable by voting for replacements.

Forest fire reportedly kills 19 people in southwest China,https://www.latimes.com/world-nation/story/2020-03-30/china-state-media-reports-19-people-killed-in-forest-fire,2020-03-31,"BEIJING —Nineteen people have died while fighting a raging forest fire in southwestern China, and hundreds of reinforcements were sent to fight the blaze and evacuate nearby residents, officials and state media reported Tuesday.
The area threatened by the fire in Sichuan province is thinly populated, but there was no estimate on how many people were leaving the evacuation zone. State media have described villages, a school, a chemical plant and other sites as being under threat.
It wasn’t clear when the deaths occurred, but an information officer in the city of Xichang was cited as saying the fire started Monday afternoon on a farm and quickly spread to nearby mountains due to strong winds. The officer said one of those killed was a guide, and the rest were firefighters.
An emergency evacuation was initiated, and more than 300 professional firefighters and 700 militiamen were sent to help; news agency Xinhua said another 885 firefighters from other cities in Sichuan were being deployed to Xichang, along with 142 fire engines, six remote water supply systems and other firefighting equipment. It said drones would be used to monitor the fire’s progress.
Along with fighting the flames and evacuating residents, those forces have also been deployed to protect key industrial infrastructure.
Almost exactly a year ago in the same area, a blaze high in the rugged forested mountains killed 30: 27 firefighters and three helpers.
That was China’s worst death toll among firefighters since 2015, when an explosion ata chemical warehouse in the port of Tianjin killed 173 people, most of them firefighters and other first responders.
Like many countries, China has seen a greater number of deadly forest fires as a result ofclimate change, habitat destruction and human encroachment into formerly wild areas. Weak industrial safety standards and enforcement have also led to frequent deadly accidents.

L.A. jail inmates say lack of soap and toilet paper heightens coronavirus fear: ‘Like slow torture’,https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2020-03-30/coronavirus-inmates-hygiene-supply-shortage-la-jails,2020-03-30,"The thin bar of soap Joseph Clarino said he and other inmates get at Los Angeles County’s Men’s Central Jail is supposed to last three days. Clarino said he’s lucky if it’s enough for one shower — maybe two if cut in half — and that the shortage extends to other supplies. Some inmates, he said, recently used torn bedsheets when toilet paper ran out.
Across the street at Twin Towers Correctional Facility, Richmond Davis said fellow inmates were cleaning with the same mop they’d used days earlier when a toilet overflowed with sewage.
As concerns over the novel coronavirus grow, conditions inside the nation’s largest jail system have raised alarms among civil rights advocates and inmates, who say social distancing is impossible when more than 100 people are crowded into a dorm and some bunks are three feet apart. Inmates, they said, may go days without the cleaning supplies needed to keep themselves safe.
“This is worse than a cruise ship,” Kristopher Howard, an inmate who has been in jail for almost a year and a half, said in a phone interview from Twin Towers. “Everybody’s on top of each other. … I’m scared. I’m scared for what could happen.”
There are no confirmed cases of COVID-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus, inside the sprawling L.A. County jails, which typically house about 17,000 people. But cases have emerged at lockups elsewhere. Men’s Central recently dealt with an outbreak of mumps in some of its dorms that infected 47 inmates and led to vaccinations of 4,500 inmates and staff, underscoring how rapidly infections can spread behind bars and contribute to overwhelming the medical system.
COVID-19 outbreaks at Rikers Island and other jails in New York City infected more than 230 prisoners and staff. In California, inmates have also tested positive in Orange County and in state prisons.
Robert L. Cohen, a physician who is a member of the NYC Board of Correction, said the New York outbreak was exacerbated by a 10-day delay in releasing people early. Over the last four days, authorities have cut the jail population by 400 inmates, down to 4,900, he said, offering a cautionary tale to jail and prison leaders across the nation.
“Wasting time is going to waste lives, and no one should die in jail who doesn’t have to,” Cohen said.
As of late Friday, 44 L.A. County jail inmates had been isolated and tested because they showed flu-like symptoms or had a fever. Of those, 35 tested negative. In the meantime, hundreds of inmates housed in units with those awaiting test results are also quarantined, part of an effort to prevent a potential outbreak.
Some said it’s only a matter of time.
“I’m anticipating at some point I will get a positive result — and then we have a plan for that,” said Jackie Clark, the county’s correctional health director.
The Sheriff’s Department did not respond to questions about how many personnel, if any, have tested positive for the virus. The Assn. for Los Angeles Deputy Sheriffs said Saturday that at least one of its members has tested positive, and it expects that number to grow.
L.A. County Sheriff Alex Villanueva said last week that cleaning crews have “doubled up on all the cleaning protocols” and that an ongoing education campaign is provided in English and Spanish.
“All of the high-traffic areas and surfaces are constantly being sanitized. We have a lot of inmate crews, and they have all the protective gear necessary, and they are scrubbing everywhere they can.”
He said every inmate has access to soap and running water “at all times, in every single cell,” but some inmates suffering from mental illness may not want to adhere to hygiene standards.
Villanueva’s remarks were at odds with what some inmates told The Times in telephone interviews last week.
Benedek Virag, who was moved from state prison to county jail last fall, said there’s no regular delivery of soap or cleaning supplies.
“Sometimes we get it; sometimes we don’t,” he said from Twin Towers. “It’s a crapshoot with that.”
Virag, 38, and Howard, his bunkmate, said they first learned of COVID-19 from news accounts. But they said regular newspaper deliveries ended around the time the virus paralyzed life in the U.S., and since then deputies have blocked television news broadcasts.
“We ask almost every day to watch the news, and they never let us,” Howard, 35, said. “We want to see what’s going on.”
“I feel like I’m gonna die in here,” he said.
Instead, Howard said, inmates are shown a video in which a doctor advises them not to touch, hug or kiss, and to wash their hands.
“Even on a non-virus day, there’s a danger to being in the jail. And now you’re adding the virus in it too?” Virag said.
The Sheriff’s Department has taken steps in recent weeks to reduce the jail population, releasing 1,700 inmates. As of Friday, there were fewer than 14,500 inmates in custody.
L.A. County Dist. Atty. Jackie Lacey moved last week to release hundreds more pretrial detainees accused of nonviolent crimes. Board of Supervisors Chairwoman Kathryn Barger, meanwhile, ordered public health officials to examine conditions in the lockups to identify “all necessary and appropriate measures” to prevent the spread of COVID-19 among inmates and staff.
“The point is that you don’t want disease incubating in the county jail system, and we have an obligation to make sure that that isn’t the case,” said Supervisor Mark Ridley-Thomas, who requested the jail assessment. He called reports of inadequate cleaning supplies “unacceptable.”
Ron Kaye, a Pasadena attorney who has sued the Sheriff’s Department and other law enforcement agencies over conditions in jails, said L.A. County jails are notorious for low hygiene standards and unhealthy conditions.
“They are essentially sitting ducks,” Kaye said of inmates. “This is not meant to be a death sentence.”
“If the virus erupts in custody, it’s going to spread like wildfire,” he added.
At the Men’s Central Jail, Steve Kaplan and other inmates said the 9300 dorm — home to 100 or so people — was locked down for more than a week after two people fell ill. No inmates were allowed in or out, which meant no court and no attorney visits. During that time, inmates said, deputies began wearing masks and gloves, but some medical requests were ignored.
Kaplan, 58, said he has severe asthma and made more than a dozen requests for an inhaler. The Sheriff’s Department said Kaplan was given an inhaler on March 4 and again on March 25 after he indicated he had lost it.
Kaplan, who has been in jail on a probation violation since December, when he was arrested on suspicion of trespassing in the lobby of a downtown L.A. hotel, said sleeping is difficult.  He said he contends with almost always being cold, with the dorm maintained at about 60 degrees.
“It’s like slow torture, keeping us in these conditions,” Kaplan said. “It’s horrible. … I’m traumatized for 22 hours a day.”
He is scheduled to be released in late May.
Clarino, 30, said that the dorm’s mop head is broken, there’s no squeegee to clean the restrooms, and only two of six phones work, but there’s nothing with which to wipe them down.
The body odor is so strong that deputies will joke, “Man, it really stinks in that dorm; thank God for the masks,” said Clarino, who was elected by inmates as the 9300 dorm’s “house mouse” to liaise with deputies. When inmates asked for masks, he said, deputies told them to buy them online.
“They almost treat it like everyone in here has the plague,” Clarino said.
Clarino said he and others are considering standing six feet apart, instead of sitting on their bunks, when deputies come by for head counts, in an act of protest to prove how difficult it is to practice social distancing.
At Twin Towers, Davis, 56, said he also struggles with keeping distance in his pod of 44 people and worries because he has a history of asthma and respiratory infection. He and other inmates typically dilute any cleaning solutions with water to make them last longer.
While Davis was on the phone with a reporter, two 24-ounce bottles of cleaning solution appeared in his pod, he said.
“They must be listening,” he said.

Coastal gas plant will shut down by 2023 as fossil fuels dry up in California,https://www.latimes.com/environment/story/2020-03-30/redondo-beach-coastal-power-plant-closing-2023,2020-03-30,"The long-awaited sale of 51 acres of prime waterfront real estate in Redondo Beach has been finalized — and it includes a commitment to shutting down the site’s gas-fired power plant, in the latest sign of California’s transition away from planet-warming fossil fuels.
Power plant operator AES Corp. said Monday it had closed on a sale of the land to real estate developer Leo Pustilnikov, in a deal that requires the company to stop operating the gas-burning generators by 2023. As part of the deal, Pustilnikov — who declined to disclose the purchase price — agreed to preserve as much as half of the site as public parkland, including several acres ofcoastal wetlandsthat were paved over decades ago.
But those commitments aren’t likely to end years of squabbling over the coastal power plant’s future. And they won’t diminish the challenge of fully replacing natural gas, California’s largest power source, with climate-friendly energy sources.
Redondo Beach officials want to see the local gas plant closed this year, not in 2023. AES was supposed to cease operations by Dec. 31, 2020, under a state policy requiring coastal energy generators to either shut down or stop sucking up ocean water for cooling, a process that harms marine life.
But the state’s Public Utilities Commission threw a wrench in the works in November, proposing to extend the closure deadline out of fear Southern Californiawon’t have enough power on hot summer evenings.
The idea was to keep the Redondo Beach facility — and three other coastal gas plants — open for another two to three years, to give utility companies time to replace them with cleaner resources, such as batteries that can store solar power for use after dark.
Redondo Beach officials have urged the State Water Resources Control Board, which controls the fate of the four gas plants, to reject any extension for the Redondo Beach facility. The city won at least a partial victory this month, when water board staffrecommendedextending the plant’s lease on life by just one year, rather than two or three.
But the sale agreement between AES and Pustilnikov may put pressure on the agency to let the gas plant operate through 2023.
If AES is allowed to keep generating and selling electricity for three more years, the company will transfer $14 million to Pustilnikov for environmental cleanup — compared to just $6.5 million with a two-year extension, and $1.5 million with after a single year.
Similarly, Pustilnikov has agreed to preserve up to 25 acres as permanent open space — but only with a three-year extension for AES. With a two-year extension his commitment falls to 12 acres of open space, and with a single year it falls to four acres.
A longer extension would allow AES to generate more revenue from electricity sales, and in turn the company would provide more funds to Pustilnikov for site cleanup. The real estate developer and AES officials say the agreement benefits Redondo Beach, too, because of the big commitment to open space in the event of a three-year extension.
“It aligns the interests of AES and myself and the city,” Pustilnikov said in an interview.
Redondo Beach Mayor Bill Brand was far from satisfied. He thinks the power plant ought to close on schedule this year.
“It emits tons of fine particulate emissions, volatile organic compounds, nitrogen oxides and greenhouse gases every year it operates,” Brand said in an interview. “There are 21,000 people living within one mile of the power plant.”
Brand described the sale agreement — which also includes a commitment from Pustilnikov to offer 15 acres to Redondo Beach for $2 million per acre — as “far inferior” to the real estate developer’s previous offer, around a year ago, to sell the city 25 acres.
Brand is also frustrated that AES and Pustilnikov “want us to stand down on our opposition” to keeping the plant open past 2020.
“We’ve been fighting to close this plant for over 10 years,” he said. “We’re going to continue our opposition to any extension.”

The State Water Resources Control Board isaccepting public commentsthrough May 11. Agency staff has recommended a one-year extension for Redondo Beach and three-year extensions for gas plants in Huntington Beach, Long Beach and Oxnard.
Whatever the state water board decides, natural gas faces a bleak future on the California power grid.
Gas accounted for about one-third of California’s electricity in 2018. It emits less planet-warming carbon dioxide than coal when burned, but it’s still a fossil fuel that contributes to sea level rise and worsening wildfires, droughts and heat waves.
State lawmakers have set a target of 100% clean electricity by 2045, which will probably require a total or near-total phaseout of gas.
Low-cost solar and wind powerare already putting some gas plants out of business. But solar and wind farms  generate electricity only when the sun is shining or the wind is blowing, and lithium-ion batteries probably can’t fill all the gaps. It’s not yet clear which technologies will ultimately get California the rest of the way to 100%, although there areseveralpotentialoptions.
Climate & Environment
After years of playing third fiddle to solar and wind power, new geothermal plants are finally getting built.
The debate over Southern California’s coastal power plants illustrates the challenge of quickly pivoting away from gas.
Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti made headlines last year when he announced the city would close three seawater-cooled gas plants. But L.A.still plans to operate two of those facilities through 2029as it figures out how to replace them with clean energy.
As for the privately owned gas plants in Huntington Beach, Long Beach, Oxnard and Redondo Beach, state officials want to see them shut down as soon as possible — but only when they feel confident the closures won’t raise the risk of power outages.
Lisa Krueger, president of AES United States, said the COVID-19 pandemic highlights the importance of a reliable power supply — and of continuing to operate the Redondo Beach gas plant a few more years, if that’s what state officials determine is needed.
“Just think how important it is in terms of keeping our electric service on so we have clean water, so we have hospitals,” Krueger said in an interview. “Having these plants available is a really good insurance policy to make sure the lights stay on.”
At the same time, Virginia-based AES says it’s planning for a future dominated by cleaner power sources. The company is installing lithium-ion batteries at its gas plant in Long Beach, and isslowly transitioning away from coalin other parts of the country.
Pustilnikov has big plans for the Redondo Beach gas plant site, and for surrounding land that he also owns. He hopes to build a corporate office campus as well as retail and commercial space, possibly including a hotel and hotel-branded residences. His vision includes repurposing some of the oldest power plant buildings into a food hall similar to New York’s Chelsea Market.
“Where else could you get 51 acres on the water?” Pustilnikov asked.
Still, he knows it won’t be easy. Redondo Beach voters must approve any redevelopment plan, a requirement that has torpedoed past proposals that Brand and other critics said would have allowed for too much housing or commercial space along the waterfront.
The public vote gives Redondo Beach officials leverage of their own as they continue to oppose a power plant extension.
“You know how when you go to a Broadway show there’s the first act and the second act? This is just the end of the first act,” Pustilnikov said. “I’m sure the redevelopment will be just another saga that will take as long,  if not longer.”

"With coronavirus testing available for all, L.A. city sites test 10,000 in one day",https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2020-04-30/testing-picks-up-with-lines,2020-05-01,"California public health officials are urging all counties to expand testing to any residents with symptoms of COVID-19, a sign of their growing confidence that testing capacity has increased enough to handle a significant portion of the state’s population.
According to the new guidelines, symptomatic low-risk people — including young adults without underlying health conditions — are now among the state’s top priorities for testing, along with six other specified groups.
Officials also announced late Wednesday that anyone who works in a high-risk setting, including grocery store employees, bus drivers and law enforcement officers, should also be included among the highest priority to receive routine screenings for the virus.
While California’s largest, wealthiest counties might have the capacity to expand testing, any increase in the number of people who get tested could prove challenging in places such as Bakersfield or Fresno, where testing sites can require a long commute.
California has “testing deserts” in parts of the Central Valley and along the Nevada and Oregon state lines, as well as in dense urban regions with large numbers of minorities, according to data compiled by the governor’s office.
To address the discrepancies, Gov. Gavin Newsom announced six new testing sites prioritizing “black and brown communities and focusing on rural communities.” About 80 others are expected to follow by early May.

Coronavirus tests for all? L.A. County clarifies how residents can get tested
In a message to health agencies and medical workers, the state health department acknowledged that some rural regions and high-density neighborhoods may not yet have the infrastructure and supplies to lift local restrictions. Officials said that the department’s prioritization guidelines should be used “when testing availability is limited” and that the policy “should not supersede the recommendations of a clinician or local health officer.”
Eventually, officials said, widespread testing will help public health departments closely track potential cases, one of the requirements for California to ease into the next phase of the pandemic response. Such tracking will require an army of at least 10,000 contact tracers, Newsom said.
But the governor has repeatedly emphasized that there is a long, methodical road ahead before social restrictions are eased, saying that the spread of the virus will ultimately decide what happens next.
“Politics will not drive our decision-making. Protests won’t drive our decision-making. Political pressure will not drive our decision-making,” Newsom said in a briefing this week. “Dates don’t. But data does.”
In Los Angeles County, any resident, regardless of whether they have symptoms, can be tested for the coronavirus at any city-run testing site.
That news traveled fast after Mayor Eric Garcetti made the announcement Wednesday.
California
New guidelines call for all symptomatic low-risk people — including young adults without underlying health conditions — to be among the state’s top priorities for testing.
At the West Valley testing site at the Warner Center on Thursday, hundreds of cars snaked through the massive parking lot and nearly completely around the block.
Christy Durham, a West Hills resident, went to the site after her 17-year-old daughter, Madison, signed up online for a test following Garcetti’s announcement.
Durham said she had driven past the testing site on previous days and the lot was never as busy as it was Thursday, with cars waiting in a 1½-mile line.
“The only time it’s that busy is Fourth of July when they’ve got fireworks at Warner Center Park,” she said.
Durham, her husband and their 14-year-old son have appointments coming up in the next few days, but she’s torn about whether to go through the long wait again. The testing process itself for her daughter went smoothly, and the workers were helpful, but it took more than two hours to reach them, she said. There appeared to be only one traffic enforcement officer to help with the mess, she said.
“The horrible thing is, I do think it’s worth it” to go through the wait again, Durham said. “I think it’s worth every L.A. resident being able to be tested. I know that a big part of the economy opening up and businesses starting to open up again is having that testing information, but [the wait] was a lot.”
Garcetti said the city-run testing sites provided about 10,000 tests on Thursday, triple the number of tests usually done in a day. The same day, the county sites tested about 4,000 people, he said.
Garcetti said local leaders believe, cumulatively, they could potentially provide up to 50,000 tests a day if needed, but that level of demand hasn’t presented itself yet.
“We have over 300,000 tests that are stockpiled from the folks that we get the tests from, and it’s not that we’re saying, ‘Hey, don’t give those to other cities or other places, we want them for ourselves for this,’” Garcetti said. “They’re confident that they’re able to continue meeting the demands of others and be able for us to expand the number that we are doing.”
Earlier in the day, L.A. County health officials made it clear that they were not similarly expanding testing criteria.
Dr. Christina Ghaly, director of the county Department of Health Services, said the county would prioritize testing for people with symptoms of COVID-19, including newly recognized symptoms such as sore throat and sudden loss of taste or smell.
The county also will emphasize testing for people working in essential services, including healthcare workers, those who work in food service and utilities, and residents of institutional living facilities, such as nursing homes.
Asked if the county and city were offering mixed messages on testing, Ghaly said the two entities were working closely together on a “rapidly evolving topic.”
“We think that this is the best approach,” Ghaly said. “We also believe that this is what is most supported in terms of the clinical evidence about who would benefit from a test.”
A few hours later, Garcetti brushed off questions from reporters about whether there was any tension between his office and the county regarding the shift in testing policy.
The city consulted with the Los Angeles County Department of Public Health on its plan to test asymptomatic people and received “positive feedback,” Garcetti said Thursday night, while also noting that the county agency doesn’t need to “sign off” on the city’s program.
“When people are eager to get back to work, to open up spaces, that depends on knowledge and knowledge comes from testing,” he said, defending the city’s approach. “And testing more people gives us more ability to open up sooner.”

"Over 60,000 lives claimed by COVID-19 in U.S. — a tally some models predicted for late summer",https://www.latimes.com/world-nation/story/2020-04-29/la-na-coronavirus-reopen-states,2020-04-30,"Amid a bleak financial outlook in which the U.S. economy saw its steepest drop since the Great Recession, a mix of both optimism and caution blanketed the country on Wednesday as officials weighed responses to the COVID-19 pandemic.
In New York, Gov. Andrew Cuomo noted that the death rate has declined in recent days but is still disturbingly high. At least 330 people died across New York State on Tuesday, Cuomo said, down from 335 and 337 the previous days.
“You see the decline has been slow at best, and [the toll is] still disgustingly high,” Cuomo said during a news conference at the state Capitol building in Albany.
World & Nation
With mounting COVID-19 deaths, New York shortens the amount of time it will hold unclaimed remains before burying them in the city’s public cemetery.
Cuomo said he will sign an executive order on Wednesday allowing hospitals in some counties in upstate New York to begin elective surgeries again. Like governors nationwide, Cuomo inrecent days has announced a multi-phased approachto reopening. The state, which has been the U.S. epicenter has a stay-at-home order that is set to expire May 15, but it could be extended.
Most of the deaths have been in New York City, where police late Tuesday broke up a massive funeral in Brooklyn for a rabbi. Nearly 2,500 Orthodox Jewish community members attended the funeral.
New York Mayor Bill de Blasio called the large gathering “unacceptable.”
“When I heard, I went there myself to ensure the crowd was dispersed. And what I saw WILL NOT be tolerated so long as we are fighting the Coronavirus,” he said on Twitter. De Blasio later said he was showing “tough love” in expressing anger over the situation.
Meanwhile, in neighboring New Jersey, Gov. Phil Murphy announced he will reopen all state parks and golf courses on May 2. He said social distancing will still be required for the foreseeable future.
The death toll from COVID-19 approached 61,000 in the United States on Wednesday, and confirmed cases surpassed 1 million, according to Johns Hopkins University. Some models had suggested the U.S. would not reach this milestone until late summer. The shuttering of businesses nationwide — restaurants, gyms, retail — has led the U.S. economy toshrink 4.8%in the first quarter.
Elsewhere across the country on Wednesday, governors continued to assess conditions in their states and craft plans for reopening businesses.
Iowa Gov. Kim Reynolds said church services with limited capacities could resume in early May. Several pastors across the country have defied stay-at-home orders, preaching before packed churches.
In Tennessee, retail shops are allowed to reopen at 50% capacity. Some businesses in Texas began allowing workers to return after Gov. Greg Abbott announced this week that on Friday restaurants could reopen at 25% capacity.
In many of these states, the racial disparities in terms of who contracts the virus and dies have been stark. A lack of access to quality healthcare, among other things, has led to higher rates of infection in black communities across the country.
A report released by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention showed that in Georgia, where businesses have almost fully reopened in recent days to the dismay of health officials, nearly 80% of those hospitalized with COVID-19 were black.
“Black patients were disproportionately represented among hospitalized patients, reflecting greater severity of COVID-19 among this population,” wrote researchers at the CDC, which is based in Atlanta.
On Wednesday, Louisiana Gov. John Bel Edwards, a Democrat, met with President Trump at the White House. He’s the latest governor to meet with Trump —on Tuesday, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, last week Cuomo — and discuss paths forward in the pandemic.
During the meeting with Bel Edwards, Trump said that social distancing guidelines would be “fading out” in the weeks and months ahead. Earlier in the week, one of his top advisors on the coronavirus task force, Dr. Deborah Birx, said social distancing would remain in place through the summer.
Edwards extended his state’s stay-at-home order, which was set to expire in the days ahead, to mid-May.
Meanwhile, DeSantis, back in Florida, announced that on Monday  portions of the state would see an eased stay-at-home order. Restaurants and retail shops would reopen at 25% capacity.
But, DeSantis said, three of the most populous counties in the state — Miami-Dade, Broward and Palm Beach — would stay under a strict order for several more weeks to help slow the spread of the virus. Florida has seen 32,800 confirmed virus cases and at least 1,170 deaths.
DeSantis said the state was taking a “very slow and methodical approach.”
“There’s a light at the end of the tunnel,” he said.

Newsletter: The plan to reopen California,https://www.latimes.com/world-nation/newsletter/2020-04-29/reopening-california-newsletter-todays-headlines,2020-04-29,"Gov. Gavin Newsom has introduced a phased plan for getting California going again, but when that happens isn’t clear.
The Plan to Reopen California
Faced with millions of people out of work, some local officials wanting to ease the coronavirus lockdown, andrising criticism— but with some areas, including Los Angeles County, still struggling to get a handle on the public health crisis — California Gov.Gavin Newsomhas unveileda four-phase planto reopen the state.
Businesses seen as presenting less risk of spreading the coronavirus could open in the near future: “We believe we are weeks, not months, away from making meaningful modifications” in the current restrictions, he said. The academic year for K-12 studentscould start in late July or early August.
But, notably, Newsom’s announcementdid not come with a guaranteed timetable or a number of details. He said that while current public health indicators such as hospitalizations and testing capacity look promising, additional progress needs to be made toward slowing the spread of the virus.
Meanwhile, L.A. County continues to be the coronavirus epicenter of California, having surpassed 1,000 deaths. The county represents about a quarter of the state population but about half of all COVID-19 hospitalizations. Officials say the restrictions on movements must continue for now, but theyare developing a plan to ease the Safer at Home order, which is set to expire May 15.

No Longer Ready for Prime Time?
President Trump’s public musing last week that doctors should consider injecting household disinfectant — a known poison — into coronavirus patients set off a political shockwave so severe that aides and alliesscrambled to rein in his prime-time nightly news conferences.
For the first time since mid-March, Trump took a two-day break from the podium over the weekend. On Sunday, he tweeted that the appearances were “not worth the time & effort.” But the former reality TV star has refused to leave the stage, even as polls show his approval rating has fallen in recent weeks.
On Tuesday, as U.S. deaths from COVID-19 topped 58,000 — exceeding the number of American fatalitiesduring the entire Vietnam War— and confirmed cases exceeded 1 million, Trump appeared before the cameras twice during the day, for 90 minutes total. He still managed to berate reporters, air familiar grievances and shower himself with praise.
An Unlikely Lab for Testing
When the coronavirus hit, L.A. County faced a testing crisis: Officials had only one test processing machine at a laboratory in Downey and had little hope of getting help from the federal government.
So they turned to a brand-new Silicon Valley start-up, Curative-Korva, with a novel approach that said it could provide a large number ofdrive-through testsvery quickly, by allowing patients to swab their own mouths after coughing. That’s not the method preferred by the Food and Drug Administration, which recommends an uncomfortable swabbing deep inside the nose by a professional.
This makes Los Angeles Countyan unlikely laboratory for COVID-19 testing. If it works, it could usher in a much more streamlined form of testing across the country. If it’s less accurate than other approaches, it could mean some of the measurements tracking the extent of the outbreak are muddier than previously known.

It’s been hailed as a silver lining of the coronavirus lockdown: With fewer cars on the road,air qualityhas improved, bringing clearer skies to cities across the world, including L.A., which had its longest streak of good air days in decades.
But that streak is over, after a recent heat wave generated unhealthy smog levels across Southern California. Air quality officials are predicting more bad air days to come, even with public health restrictions in effect, as the region enters a hotter, drier time of year.

Many states scrambling to update hurricane plans for virus,https://www.latimes.com/world-nation/story/2020-05-31/states-scramble-update-hurricane-plans-coronavirus,2020-05-31,"Officials across the South are still scrambling to adjust their hurricane plans to the coronavirus. The big unknown: Where will people fleeing storms go?
The Associated Press surveyed more than 70 counties and states from Texas to Virginia and found that more than 60% of coastal counties said as of late May they were still solidifying plans for public hurricane shelters. They’re also altering preparations for dealing with the sick and elderly, protective equipment and cleanup costs.
In Georgia’s McIntosh County, south of Savannah, Emergency Management Agency Director Ty Poppell said evacuations during the pandemic would be a “nightmare.” He worried about social distancing at shelters and on buses used to get people out.
“I’d love to be able to tell you we’ve got that answered right now,” Poppell said. “It’s a work in progress.”
Hurricane season officially starts Monday, though tropical storms Arthur and Bertha arrived early. Forecasters are expecting a busier-than-normal season.
“Everything that we do will be affected in one way or another, big and/or small, by COVID-19,” Florida Emergency Management Director Jared Moskowitz said.
Many counties are taking federal advice and hope to use hotels as smaller-scale shelters. Others plan to use additional areas of schools besides just the gymnasiums. Still others, especially in Louisiana, plan for big shelters with more social distancing.
Officials emphasize that shelters are a last resort and urge people to stay with friends or in hotels. But massive unemployment is making the expense of hotels less feasible.
“Our biggest change to our hurricane plan is sheltering. How are we going to shelter those that have to evacuate? How are we going to shelter those that are positive-COVID patients? There are multiple ideas that we are considering right now,” Mississippi Emergency Management Agency Director Greg Michel said.
During tornadoes in April, the state used hotels as shelters, which was good practice for hurricane season, he said.
Most counties surveyed said they were still figuring out shelters.
Although that may sound worrisome, it could be beneficial because emergency managers need to update plans as the pandemic changes, said University of South Carolina disaster expert Susan Cutter.
But Brad Kieserman, an American Red Cross executive, sounded a cautionary note.
“Disasters are not going to stop for COVID-19,” he told reporters earlier in May. “Hope is not a plan. And we’ve got to plan for tens of thousands of people to evacuate in the face of hurricanes and wildfires and other disasters.”
Shelters were the most mentioned worry in the survey, but comfort levels with other aspects of hurricane preparations varied, reflecting the difference in how states plan for disasters. Having enough staff for shelters is a persistent problem locally and nationally, said Jeff Goldberg, emergency management chief for Florida’s Walton County.
Protective equipment is the biggest shortfall in several North Carolina counties. Money is always an issue, with counties often waiting for federal reimbursement. Handling nursing homes, hospitals and COVID-19 patients “is one of the most difficult challenges and would require a larger state response,” said Jeffrey Johnson, fire chief in Newport News, Va.
Other places downplayed concerns. Orleans Parish, where 2005’s Hurricane Katrina ravaged New Orleans, has added social distancing and protective equipment to a 10-year-old plan that’s otherwise “essentially unchanged. It’s a good plan,” said Collin Arnold, head of the city’s emergency preparedness office.
A year ago, officials in North Carolina’s Beaufort County would have rated their readiness going into hurricane season at a 95 on a 0-to-100 scale. With the virus, that’s down to 75. Brad Baker, emergency management director of Florida’s Santa Rosa County, gave the same numbers “because there’s a lot of unknowns with COVID.”
In Texas’ Nueces County, which was swamped by 2017’s Hurricane Harvey, officials said they were at a 95 going into hurricane season last year. Now, it’s below 80, emergency management coordinator Melissa Munguia said. If another Harvey brings 50 inches of rain, she said, the same reinforcements won’t arrive because “everybody’s been working their personnel for many hours for over 100 days.”
Florida officials were far more upbeat.
“While COVID-19 complicates things and you have to plan around [it], I think Florida is as prepared as ever before in response to a hurricane,” said Moskowitz, the state emergency management chief.
In Louisiana, disaster officials said they were used to “overlapping emergencies, and you just have to plow through.”
They anticipate making adjustments, “but it’s hard to pin down what those changes will be,” said Mike Steele, spokesman for the state’s emergency preparedness office. By August and September, typically the height of Louisiana’s hurricane season, the number of infections and social distancing requirements may have changed, he said.
Coping with a hurricane is hard, and the coronavirus “is going to make it a little bit more difficult,” Federal Emergency Management Agency Director Pete Gaynor told reporters in May. But he said FEMA had hired 500 people since March and had a record $80 billion in its disaster fund.
Vice President Mike Pence told President Trump on Thursday that the federal government would ensure state and local authorities could handle hurricanes. “Bottom line, Mr. President, we’re ready.”
Academics who study disasters aren’t so sure.
“I don’t think [federal officials] are doing the job they should be doing. I worry about their ability to handle a very large hurricane in addition to COVID-19,” said Cutter, of the University of South Carolina.
She and others said mixed messages on the coronavirus meant some people weren’t believing what they’re hearing from Washington in an emergency.
“I think our lives are in danger now because we don’t trust the federal government,” Cutter said.
With the pandemic, a crashing economy and patchy federal responses to three 2017 hurricanes, people should prepare for little help from the government, Virginia Commonwealth University emergency preparedness professor Hans-Louis Charles said.
Experts also worry that it could take longer to return to normal after a hurricane. Search and rescue teams, utility workers who restore power lines and volunteers who help clean up may be slowed or not respond at all because of concerns over virus exposure, experts said. That and other issues may mean a storm that in the past caused $12 billion in insured damage, like 2018’s Hurricane Michael, may cost 20% more, catastrophic-risk modeler Karen Clark said.
Although many officials are still trying to figure out shelters, they said if people were told to evacuate in a hurricane, residents must go. Storm surge is more dangerous than the coronavirus, officials said.
“In hurricane season, we can’t have mixed messages. If you live in an evacuation zone, your plan is to evacuate if ordered to do so by local officials,” former FEMA director Craig Fugate said. “This message will not change, COVID or no COVID.”

"California surpasses 4,000 coronavirus-related deaths, with L.A. County hardest hit",https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2020-05-29/coronavirus-deaths-california-los-angeles,2020-05-30,"Los Angeles County reported 50 additional coronavirus-related deaths Friday, bringing California’s total to more than 4,000 — a somber milestone in the months-long pandemic that has ravaged communities and local economies. More than half of the state’s deaths have occurred inL.A. County.
The county also confirmed an additional 1,824 new cases, bringing the total to 51,562.
The news came after the county received permission from the state to reopen hair salons and barbershops and allow in-person dining.
The relaxed restrictions do not necessarily mean business as usual, though. County public health officials are expected to announce restrictions on operations, including a 60% capacity limit for restaurants.
That said, Public Health Director Barbara Ferrer said Friday that businesses are not required to be inspected before reopening and can do so as soon as they’re able to adhere to protocols.
California
L.A. County, the epicenter of California’s coronavirus outbreak, can reopen restaurants for in-person dining and resume services at hairstyling shops.
Gov. Gavin Newsom said that if a surge in coronavirus cases or hospitalizations occurs as counties continue to lift stay-at-home restrictions, the state may tell officials to pull back.
“We will direct local health officials to put a dimmer switch on,” he said Friday. “We are not mandating a pace for opening.”
Dr. Christina Ghaly, director of health services for L.A. County, said Friday that although the numbers of local cases are flattening, the county may see a new upward curve as more businesses reopen and chances of transmission increase. But that wouldn’t necessarily mean that the county would have to backtrack.
Ferrer said the state is developing a dashboard for counties to track statewide metrics related to improvements and pitfalls as modifications continue.
“If in fact the state determines that there’s a cause of concern, what they really are doing is offering technical support,” Ferrer said. The state wouldn’t necessarily inform a county to rescind its eased restrictions but would instead try to understand what is driving an increase in numbers to properly assist.
The death toll in the state — which now stands at 4,051 — remains much lower than in the coronavirus hot spots of Michigan, New Jersey and New York. But officials have said that though other metrics such as hospitalizations and new confirmed cases offer signs of significant progress, deaths in California remain a major concern.
Los Angeles County remains the center of the outbreak in California, with a total of 2,294 COVID-19 deaths. The number of confirmed cases in L.A. Countyrepresents about half of all California cases.
California
Los Angeles County announced Tuesday that it will align with California’s latest guidelines to allow faith-based services, in-store shopping at low-risk retail stores, drive-in movies and other recreational activities. Beauty salons will still be closed.
Earlier this week, the county allowed shopping malls and churches to reopen with strict social distancing and safety rules.
With the city of Los Angeles, Mayor Eric Garcetti on Friday announced that restaurants, barbershops and hair salons were permitted to reopen effective immediately, with stylists limited to one customer at a time with everyone required to wear masks.
Restaurants were also allowed to reopen and can apply with the city to open their sidewalks and private parking lots to outdoor dining as well, the mayor said. Houses of worship can fill up to 25% capacity or 100 people, whichever is lower, as long as social distancing guidelines are met and congregants wear masks, Garcetti said. Office workers too may begin to return to their jobs if teleworking from home isn’t possible.
Elsewhere in the state, San Francisco Mayor London Breed on Thursday unveiled aplan for reopening the city,including allowing outdoor dining andpermitting customers inside retail storesbeginning June 15.
“We’re entering a new phase of this crisis and we feel comfortable that we’re at a place that we can begin reopening parts of our economy,” Breed said. “But that is not to say that this virus doesn’t continue to threaten our city.”
San Francisco’s planincludes three phases.
In addition to allowing outdoor dining and restricted in-store retail service by June 15, the city plans to permit private household indoor services, religious services and ceremonies, outdoor exercise classes, sports games with no spectators, and nonemergency medical appointments.
The second phase would start on July 13, when restaurants could reopen for indoor dining, hair salons and barbershops could reopen, and real estate open houses could resume by appointment only.
By mid-August, schools, bars, nail salons, gyms, playgrounds, indoor museums, tattoo parlors and swimming pools might be able to reopen.
In the final phase — the date of which has yet to be determined — the city would reopen concert venues, nightclubs, festivals and hotels for tourism.
City officials cautioned that the schedule would be followed only if San Francisco continued to make progress in slowing the spread of COVID-19.
“We want to lock in those gains, and we want to move forward in a way that is going to be safe for everybody,” said San Francisco County Health Officer Dr. Tomás Aragón during an online forum with the mayor Friday.
During the 1918 flu pandemic, Aragón said, the places that reopened slowly did better economically because they did not have large second waves of infection.
He added that health officers and the city’s health department will soon release new guidelines about how families from different households might safely interact. The guidelines would focus on social distancing, face coverings, hand washing and the need to be tested first if a person felt ill, he said.
But at the same time,  Newsom has routinely cautioned that even with businesses across the state starting to reopen, the threat of the coronavirus is not over.
“This virus has not gone away,” the governor said earlier this month. “Let’s not develop amnesia. Let’s not forget why we’re in this position in the first place. Let’s not be naive about the virulence of this disease.”

"Citing ‘existential threat,’ House climate action plan has a big focus on California",https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2020-06-30/house-climate-action-plan-big-focus-california-equity,2020-07-01,"California and other U.S. states face “an existential threat” from climate change that requires a robust government response, a House select committee statedin a 538-page action plan Tuesday.
The ambitious plan, authored by Congress’ first-ever committee dedicated exclusively to climate change, could be a framework for addressing the planet’s warming, depending on the outcomes of the November election.
“Individuals and the private sector cannot achieve unprecedented pollution reductions on their own,” the House Select Committee on the Climate Crisis said in its report. “Only through a coordinated national response can the United States deliver the urgent and systemic changes needed to avert the worst consequences of climate change.”
The report calls for 12 pillars of action, including reducing carbon pollution, making communities more resilient to the impacts of climate change and building a more equitable energy economy. Specific targets include bringing the U.S. to net zero emissions by 2050 and delivering $8 trillion in health and climate benefits.
May 2020 tied forthe highest global May temperaturesince record-keeping began 141 years ago, according to the NOAA. It also exceeded the highest monthly average for atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations.
The plan’s emphasis on establishing pollution reduction targets — including substantial reductions in net U.S. greenhouse gas emissions — aims to reverse or at least mitigate these trends, but it is unlikely to have any immediate impact since it would need to be embraced by the Republican-led Senate and President Trump, who has called climate changea hoaxand appointed skeptics to top environment and energy posts.
In the past, Republicans have been critical of Democratic action plans such asthe New Green Deal, introduced by Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York and Sen. Edward J. Markey of Massachusetts, arguing such blueprints will hurt the U.S. economy and sectors dependent on inexpensive energy sources.
In a joint statement issued Tuesday, Republicans on the committee said they were disappointed the plan’s rollout did not include an “amendment process where all committee members could vote on recommendations to report to Congress,” and argued that the country should look toward renewable energy as a supplement to, not a replacement for, oil and gas.
“Smart climate policy must seek ways to address emissions, while protecting the economic and geopolitical value of our natural resources,” they wrote.
But Democrats see the action plan as a way to elevate environmental issues as they try to hold the House and take back in the Senate and White House in the coming election.
“Against this backdrop, one may wonder why Select Committee Democrats would choose to release this report with recommendations to solve the climate crisis,” the preface reads. “We cannot wait.”
The report also hits close to home: it calls for the creation of “clean energy” jobs, a field in which more than 100,000 workers in California havebeen laid off due to the coronavirus pandemic.
Politics
Long and intense heat waves are nothing new in Southern California and the Southwest, but amid COVID-19, public health experts are warning they could become deadlier for people self-isolating in homes they can’t keep cool.
It recommends timely action on several California-introduced climate bills, including theWildfire Defense Act, which empowers local communities to implement wildfire prevention and mitigation methods, and the West Coast Ocean Protection Act, which prohibits the Interior Department from issuing oil and gas leases off the coast of California, Oregon or Washington. Three of the committee’s nine Democratic members hail from California.
“Our report will build on the progress in California with bold action and legislation,” said committee member Rep. Mike Levin (D-San Juan Capistrano), “while also putting Congress on a path to ensure our state has a federal partner that truly wants to address the climate crisis.”
In several instances, the climate action plan points to California as a model for other states to follow: it lauds Gov. Jerry Brown’s 2018 legislation requiring100% zero-carbon electric generationby 2045, and identifies California as the “strongest example” of state-authorized funding for public participation in natural gas proceedings. It also touts the state’s stance on vehicle emissions and recommends that Congress “allow all states to adopt and enforce California’s motor vehicle emission standards.”
But the report also points to California as a case study for the negative impacts of climate change. The state’saging electric sector— whose equipment malfunctions constitute the third leading cause of wildfires — is vulnerable to outages caused by hotter, drier conditions. The plan calls for a comprehensive federal strategy to help grid operators and utilities such as  PG&E plan for and prevent power interruptions in the face of increasing extreme weather events.

Noting that California and other western states will become increasingly vulnerable to wildfires, floods, droughts and other disasters caused by more extreme conditions, it also reflected on the current moment — the COVID-19 pandemic, rampant unemployment and racial justice demonstrations — to argue that climate change is sure to spread its impacts unevenly, and is already doing so.
“Populations that are already vulnerable, including lower-income communities, communities of color, children, and the elderly, are more at risk to the health impacts of climate change,” the report said.
Like the Green New Deal before it, the new climate action plan seeks to counteract environmental injustices. It calls for the creation of a private right of action under the Civil Rights Act for disparate pollution impacts, as well as investments into housing and solar projects and the reduction of contamination within impacted communities.
“Engaging leaders from these communities early in the policymaking process and soliciting their expertise throughout is essential for ensuring the policies will work in their communities and benefit those most in need,” the report reads.

Brewers’ Ryan Braun hopes there’s a 2020 MLB season because it could be his last,https://www.latimes.com/sports/story/2020-06-29/markazi-column-with-ryan-braun,2020-06-30,"As Milwaukee Brewers outfielder Ryan Braun prepared to leave his Malibu home Monday to return to Milwaukee for the restart of team training, he wasn’t sure how long he would be gone.
“There’s still a part of me that isn’t quite sure we will actually play games,” said Braun, a six-time All-Star. “I’m optimistic that we will play games, but obviously if we look at what’s happening in the country, theCOVID numbersare not good. There are a significant number of athletes who have tested positive, which is indicative of the overall numbers in our country right now.”
About half of MLB‘s 30 teams play in states that show a rise in 14-day trends inCOVID-19cases. MLB plans to start its regular season July 23 or 24, and it will do so outside of a “bubble” similar to what theNBA, WNBA andMLSwill be entering in Florida next month.
Baseball will be played in the usual ballparks, and the players will be driving home after games, eating at restaurants, hanging out with friends and family in some of the biggest COVID-19 hot spots.
Dodgers
Fans in attendance at MLB games this shortened season is a possibility, according to the Operations Manual and other factors.
“We’re all hopeful we’ll be able to complete a season,” Braun said. “Ultimately, the most important factor in all of this is the safety and health of everyone involved because we’re going to be traveling, staying in hotels, riding on buses and airplanes and doing all of these things where we will be around and interacting with people in communities all over the country. If our health and safety become compromised, we would all be understanding but at the same time disappointed of having to cancel the season.”
Braun is leaving behind his wife, Larisa, 5-year-old daughter Celine, 3-year-old son Greyson and  4-week-old son Carter. As things are, he isn’t comfortable with them traveling to Milwaukee right now. He wants to wait to see whether there is even an MLB season and where both regions are  in terms of case numbers and hospitalizations next month.
“They won’t come initially because there’s a lot of unknowns and uncertainty,” he said. “I think it’s easier and safer to stay here for now and then we’ll assess how things go and if everything is normal and safe.”
Braun, who will be 37 in November, is entering the final year of a five-year, $105-million extension and said this season — if there is one — could be his last.
“Christian [Yelich] and all those guys like to make fun of me because I’m the old guy in our group, so they think this is my last year,” said Braun, who was the National League’s rookie of the year in 2007 and its MVP in 2011. “I do have three young children, so certainly it’s a possibility. We’ll see how this year goes and see where I’m at physically.”
Braun said he was confident players and owners would do everything possible to get the season in, even if  it meant relocating games or teams.
“We recognize there might be some situations where teams have to move or game locations are moved at the last minute and we’re fine with that,” he said. “I think we’re ready to embrace that because playing a season will positively impact so many people’s lives. … We’re excited about the idea of getting started but there’s also some nervousness and some apprehension.
“The most important aspect of any of this stuff is the health and safety of the players, coaches, personnel and everyone else. It depends on what happens with public health officials, with the CDC, with the government with everything that’s happening with COVID numbers.”
As Braun spoke, he was holding a bottle of hand sanitizer and wearing a “California Strong” mask as he sat in his backyard overlooking the Pacific Ocean. California Strong is the nonprofit foundation started by Braun; Yelich; Mike Attanasio, son of Brewers principal owner Mark Attanasio; Cincinnati Reds infielder Mike Moustakas, who had been with the Brewers the previous two seasons; and Rams quarterback Jared Goff.
The foundation originally began with the help of the Southeast Ventura County YMCA to raise money and awareness to support those affected by the  shooting at the Borderline Bar & Grill in Thousand Oaks and the destruction wrought by the California wildfires in November 2018. It has now transitioned into COVID-19 relief.
Dodgers
The Dodgers named 51 players to their initial 2020 season player pool, and none are players drafted earlier this month. They can add up to nine more players.
The foundation says it has donated money, meals and equipment to several public-service organizations, and its founders are looking forward to resuming their careers — when it’s safe.
“I’m excited about having the opportunity to go back and play, but at the same time I’m a little bit scared of what it will look like,” Braun said. “My biggest priority is being a father first and a husband second, so to leave three young children and my wife to go into an environment where I don’t know what it will look like or when exactly I will come back or how safe it will be, it’s a little bit scary and completely different than anything I’ve experienced before.”

"After 250 years, Esselen Tribe regains a piece of its ancestral homeland",https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2020-07-31/after-250-years-esselen-tribe-regains-a-piece-of-its-ancestral-homeland,2020-07-31,"After 250 years, theEsselen Tribe of Monterey Countyis returning home.
A $4.5-million land deal, brokered by Portland-based environmental groupWestern Rivers Conservancy, will return a 1,199-acre parcel of wilderness along the Little Sur River to the tribe in the name of conservation and cultural resilience.
The transfer will mark the first land returned to the Esselen since they were displaced centuries ago.
In 1770, Spanish colonists gathered up the Esselen, whom they considered “neophytes and heathens,” said Tribal Chairman Tom Little Bear Nason, and forced them to convert to Catholicism.
“This is the center of our universe,” Nason said of the land. “We are so incredibly empowered to return to the actual birthplace of our people.”
Although the parcel represents only a small fraction of the tribe’s original ancestral territory, Nason said it will be a refuge after years of alienation.
“Elders always foretold that we would reconnect to our ancestral homeland,” he said. “So basically, a prophecy has been fulfilled.”
The property faces Pico Blanco, a stately, mossy mountain in the Santa Lucia range considered an essential part of the tribe’s origin story. But with old-growth trees, rolling hills of wildflowers and a deep river canyon, the land transfer is as much about conservation as it is about environmental justice.
“Our motivation is rivers and the critters that depend on them,” said Sue Doroff, president and co-founder of Western Rivers Conservancy. “To combine these conservation and recreation accomplishments with repatriating the land to the tribe — it’s ideal.”
The parcel was purchased with a grant provided by theCalifornia Natural Resources Agency. The previous owner was a Swedish family who initially went under contract with another buyer, Doroff said. Whenthe Soberanes fireswept through the area in 2016, the buyer was scared off and Western Rivers Conservancy was able to move in.
“If the property was purchased by a private party, it would certainly be developed,” Doroff said, noting that would have been a “real loss” because the property links U.S. Forest Service land on the coast to the main body of Los Padres National Forest.
With one of the last viable streams for summer steelhead on the Central California coast, the land is also part of the Big Sur stronghold for the threatened fish. And since its ancient redwoods — some of the southernmost in the world — could serve as a nursery for redwood seeds, it may prove crucial for climate change adaptation.
“This property rings all the bells for fish, for wildlife,” Doroff said. “And the fact that the Esselen will be the land managers and long-term stewards of this property, and its owners, is just a bonus, and super exciting.”
When Western Rivers Conservancy first went under contract on the property in 2015, the original plan was to transfer it to the Forest Service. But locals objected, citing concerns about increased traffic, tourism and fire danger.
That’s when the group decided to partner with the Esselen, who agreed to manage the land with both the community and conservation in mind. Nason said the tribe plans to build altars, a ceremonial dance house and a bear dance lodge. They also hope to rebury ancestors whose burial sites were disturbed by development.
Because the Esselen are not a federally recognized tribe, the property will be held by the tribe’s 501(c)(3) organization, Doroff said. The tribal members will own it in fee, which means it is legally theirs, although they are obligated to follow a management plan to ensure its longevity.
That the transfer happened in the midst of a pandemic is significant, Doroff added, in that it is a reminder that these kinds of issues can’t fall by the wayside.
“We all have to pay attention to the things that we love and the places that we care about,” she said. “This work must go on, because if it doesn’t, these opportunities will be lost forever.”

Ron Howard’s ‘Rebuilding Paradise’ is a stirring portrait of a town devastated by the Camp fire,https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/movies/story/2020-07-30/rebuilding-paradise-review-camp-fire-documentary-ron-howard,2020-07-30,"The sound of wind is rarely as sinister as it is at the beginning of “Rebuilding Paradise,”Ron Howard’sharrowing and heartrending new documentary. The loud, 40-mph gusts we hear are a grim omen, and they soon merge with other noises — anxious radio chatter, screaming sirens, the crackle of flames, the pop-pop of exploding tires — to form a chorus of fast-mounting dread. Through it all we hear a succession of human voices, trying to remain steady but finally abandoning any pretense of calm: “Please, we need your help, Lord,” a woman prays. “I’m scared,” another sobs. “I’m scared.”
You will share her fear. These opening moments return us to Nov. 8, 2018, the day the Camp fire,the deadliest wildfire in California history, destroyed the Butte County town of Paradise. The on-the-ground footage we see is as awful as what we hear: As flames lick at driveways and engulf crumbling buildings, as embers rain down on fleeing vehicles, we seem trapped in a conflagration so mighty and all-consuming that the entire world has turned black and orange. But all is not lost: Suddenly we’re in a car that passes through a thick cloud of smoke and ash and then emerges, miraculously, into daylight on the other side. A clear blue sky has never looked so welcome.
That moment of hope is fleeting but important. Filmed over the year that followed the deadly blaze, “Rebuilding Paradise” is about redemption as well as destruction, which you might guess from both the title and Howard’s well-known affinity for uplift. But while the filmmaker keeps his eyes peeled for every possible shred of good news in the wake of disaster, he has little interest in peddling easy inspiration; the stakes are too colossal, the devastation too raw. When the Camp fire swept through Paradise, it left 85 people dead, destroyed 14,000 homes and displaced tens of thousands of residents. For many of them, there was simply no going back. But others, some of them profiled in this movie, saw no choice but to return — and remain.
One of those historic small towns much idealized for their beauty, close-knit community and idyllic way of life, Paradise commanded intense loyalty among those who called it home. But apart for some brief early footage, Howard doesn’t spend a lot of time delving into the past or showing us the town as it once existed. Staying firmly in the present tense, he and his camera crew spend a lot of time following their subjects, some of whom have temporarily relocated to trailer homes in nearby Chico.
A few high schoolers, returning to what used to be their houses, marvel at metal bed frames and other abandoned possessions that have burned almost beyond recognition. A man points out buildings, including a hospital, that no longer exist. In effect, the filmmakers make us imagine what Paradise used to be by sifting through the wreckage of what it has become.
They also adopt the familiar strategy of telling a sweeping, panoramic story through a handful of individuals, using the faces of a few to represent the travails of the many. Given the sheer scale of the destruction, it’s a reductive but effective tactic, especially in terms of providing an overall snapshot of municipal recovery. We meet a police officer, Matt Gates, who breaks down while recalling a woman’s narrow escape during the blaze, and whose work — dramatically redefined in the wake of the tragedy — takes its toll on his family life. We also meet former Paradise mayor Steve “Woody” Culleton, who was once the self-described “town drunk” before he sobered up and became an elected official, a turnaround narrative that gently underscores the town’s own hopes of regeneration.
The most engaging figure is school superintendent Michelle John, who determinedly goes about the daunting task of providing for the young students of Paradise, many of whom are now homeless. A scene of John comforting students in makeshift classrooms hits especially close to home; as an image of American schools being uprooted, it may remind you, as it reminded me, of the more recent, farther-reaching crisis of the COVID-19 pandemic.
“Rebuilding Paradise” was finished and first shown atthis year’s Sundance Film Festivalwell before the pandemic erupted, and as a result it doesn’t address the myriad ways in which the coronavirus hashindered and even reversed Paradise’s recovery. (A sequel or two may be in order.) As the film makes clear, the town was facing enough obstacles already, from the gutting of infrastructure to the toxic chemicals that were released during the fire, poisoning the water supply. And that’s not even mentioning the enormous financial burdens and the incalculable trauma suffered by those who lost loved ones, homes, memories and an entire way of life.
Howard has made documentaries before (among them last year’s“Pavarotti”), and he also notably played with fire in the 1991 drama“Backdraft.”His work here is solid, sensitive and unobtrusive. He and his collaborators (they include cinematographer Lincoln Else and editor M. Watanabe Milmore) find the stirring drama in quotidian moments, from a bittersweet Christmas celebration to the many tense meetings where the people of Paradise try to figure out a way forward. A lot of those meetings, one of which is attended by Erin Brockovich, are focused on legal action againstPacific Gas & Electricfor the role its equipment played in starting the blaze. (Earlier this year, PG&E pleaded guilty to84 counts of involuntary manslaughterin the Camp fire.)
But the documentary also points to sustained drought, rising temperatures and other environmental conditions that essentially cleared a path for fires to wipe out Paradise, as well as other communities in the future. Howard sounds a queasy note of alarm, placing the Camp fire in the context of the recent Australian bushfires, the floods that have decimated South Asia and other deadly disasters exacerbated by climate change. When a Paradise resident gives a speech at film’s end and declares, “We aren’t alone in this,” her ostensibly reassuring words can’t help but sound like a warning.

Second effort to boost wildfire funding falls flat in the California Legislature,https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2020-08-31/wildfire-funding-bill-effort-fails-california-legislature,2020-09-01,"SACRAMENTO —An eleventh-hour push in the California Legislature to direct$500 million to wildfire response and preventionfell flat Monday, marking the second late attempt to boost fire funding that failed in the last week.
The efforts to secure more money for wildfires fizzled out as blazes burned more than a million acres across the state during the frenetic final days of the legislative year.
Arguing that California needs to do more to prevent fires, Democrats in the Senate came up with the plan to spend $500 million dollars on fires aftera bill to generate $3 billion for wildfire and climate projectsthrough the extension of a fee on electricity bills failed to gain traction last week.
But even the scaled-back spending plan was fraught with legislative hurdles that proved too difficult to overcome and the plan was scuttled before it was officially introduced. Senate President Pro Tem Toni Atkins’ office confirmed that the proposal was dead late Monday.
The late nature of the proposal would have required Gov. Gavin Newsom to submit a statement to the Legislature saying the bill was necessary to address a state of emergency and waive a state law that prevents lawmakers from amending legislation in the final hours before the Legislature adjourns for the year.
Action from Newsom also hinged on the ability of the Senate and Assembly to strike a deal to support the plan, which never materialized.
The push came after lawmakers introduced AB 1659 one week ago to add 10 years to an existing utility fee for bonds to pay for wildfire and climate projects.
AB 1659 repeated a financial model lawmakers had created last year when they extended the fee for 15 years to 2035 to generate bonds used to pay for wildfire damages caused by utility equipment. The 2019 law made it easier for utilities to avoid being on the hook for wildfire damages through a new safety certification process and created a $21-billion fund as an additional shield against losses from blazes linked to their equipment.
The attempt to tap customers for another decade of fees didn’t sit well with ratepayers, lawmakers and some of the state’s most powerful business groups. The California Chamber of Commerce, the California Farm Bureau Federation, the Western States Petroleum Assn., Pacific Gas & Electric, San Diego Gas & Electric and the Utility Reform Network were among the opponents of the bill.
By Saturday, lawmakers had dropped the extension on ratepayers and instead mapped out a plan to come up with $500 million from California’s cap-and-trade program — which requires companies to buy permits to release greenhouse gas emissions — as well as state general fund revenues and a 2018 bond measure.
“Our state is on fire,” said Sen. Ben Allen (D-Santa Monica) as he and other lawmakers attempted to earn support for the proposal. “This is a vital and urgent need and I certainly hope we can get it done.”
The money would have gone to a variety of efforts aimed at addressing wildfires and climate change, including cooling centers, backup solar power, emergency shelters, warning and detection systems,hardening projects, forest health and workforce training.

California could soon end its dumb policy on inmate firefighters. What took so long?,https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2020-08-31/firefighter-inmate-prison-wildfire-california-coronavirus,2020-08-31,"All it would take is one phone call from a fire department. Any fire department.
Joshua McKinney assured me of this one recent morning, standing in the shade in his grandmother’s driveway in South Los Angeles as an LAPD helicopter circled overhead.
For weeks now, ever since the 26-year-old got out of prison in June, he has been trying to earn a paycheck in an economy that’s in shambles and dreaming of returning to the fire lines, where he worked to get months off his sentence, earning a pittance.
“I went in mainly to get out early, but as I was there, I actually fell in love with it,” McKinney explained. “I was like, ‘Dang, I never knew how much I loved hard work.’”
He and thousands of other Californians are barred from suiting up again because of their criminal records, and that is just stupid for a state that is woefully short on resources to fight fires. In recent weeks,firefighters have been overrunin Northern California, slammed from all sides bywildfires that have killed at least sevenand scorched what’s already topped 1.4 million acres.
Thankfully, this could soon change.
After years of pushing, mostly by Assemblywoman Eloise Gomez Reyes (D-Grand Terrace), the Legislature on Sunday night sent a bill to the governor’s desk that would help former prisoners — most of them Black and Latino — to earn the emergency medical technician license necessary to become full-time, year-round firefighters with the state, and numerous counties and cities.
Under AB 2147, former prisoners who have successfully worked in one of theCalifornia Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation’s fire campswill be able to petition a judge to quickly expunge their records and waive parole time. They then would be able to apply not only for an EMT license but a host of other licenses required by other professions.
Logical, right?
All it took was a bit of creative policymaking to please the firefighters’ union, a pandemic that has emptied prisons and fire camps alike, an early wildfire season that has alreadydestroyed scores of homes in Northern California, an eye-popping unemployment rate, and nonstop protests over the long-standing racial inequities of the criminal justice system.
That said, it shouldn’t have taken all of these compounding catastrophes to summon the political will to rightone of California’s most notorious wrongs.
We use thousands of prisoners to do the grunt work of fighting fires, pay them a slave wage to do it and then, when they get out, we refuse to offer them a job doing the same thing for an actual living wage with benefits. And then we have the nerve to crow about our progressive values on criminal justice reform. Meanwhile, the state’s recidivism rate remains “stubbornly high,” averaging 50% in the last decade,according to a recent state audit.
Even the Los Angeles Lakers took California to task over this hypocrisy last week, issuing a rare tweet in support of then-pending legislation from Reyes.
Thank you to all of our firefighters and first responders, including our incarcerated men and women fighting the current California wildfires.Human rights are everyone’s rights.Create a pathway for former inmates who successfully completed fire camp while incarcerated.pic.twitter.com/U0j6TsfKBL
“We know that these incarcerated firefighters have already demonstrated a commitment and desire to turn their life around,” Reyes said, noting that corrections officials preemptively weed out prisoners who have committed serious offenses, such as rape, or have a history of escape with violence. “I would hope that most of us would agree that an individual willing to face down a fire and smoke is much more than the sum of their previous mistakes.
“I don’t want a sentence that has been completed to become a life sentence. And unfortunately, our criminal justice system has done just that. Even after somebody has completed their sentence, they’re living a life sentence, because so many doors are shut to them.”
This is something McKinney is quickly coming to understand. Now that he’s out of prison and on parole, he has applied for one of the few spots in the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection’s Firefighter Training and Certification Program, run out of the Ventura Conservation Camp. Launched a couple of years ago, it helps people with criminal records compete for entry-level firefighting jobs with state, federal and local agencies.
California
For well over a week, hundreds of inmates have chain-sawed through relentless thickets of chaparral, cutting lines through the backcountry to thwart the fire’s sudden rushes at homes.
In the meantime, though, McKinney is at a bit of a loss about what to do with himself.
“I’m just, I don’t know,” he said with a shrug. “Well, I’m not gonna say I don’t know. I know what I want to do. But I don’t have the proper certifications.”
McKinney’s friend, Eric Hunt, went through a similar experience when he was released from prison after a stint in a fire camp.
At first, Hunt tried to get a job at fire departments, only to find out that he couldn’t, he said. Then he landed a job doing recruitment for a jobs program for at-risk youth and veterans. Then one of his bosses found out he was on parole and Hunt, who grew up in Pomona and now lives in Altadena, said he was let go.
So now Hunt has joined the ranks of Californians looking for steady employment in an economy turned upside down by the COVID-19 pandemic. Nearly4.8 million people in the state are collecting unemployment benefits. The most recent figures, according to the U.S. Labor Department, showed 209,500 initial claims during the week ending Aug. 22 — a number that is going up, not down.
To make ends meet now, Hunt does a little of this and a little of that, he said. A natural salesman with a quick wit and a tendency to talk in inspirational koans — “Like my uncle told me, you ain’t had a best friend ‘til you been one” — he sells fruit cobblers at farmers markets and wants to teach paint-and-sip classes once he finds the right outdoor location.
But what he loves to do is talk about wildfires and about fighting them, usually with full-on reenactments and sound effects.
Like the time Hunt was ordered to help set a controlled burn. It was the first real wildfire he had experienced.
“I didn’t know fire grew so fast and could get so hot. And I’m like, man, back of my neck is hot. And I look and there’s just this wall of fire there — 200 feet in the air, just fire. All of this air starts to whip these trees around and I’m like, oh my God.”
He just started running.
“I’m swinging my arms, and I’m flinging fuel all behind me on the bushes. I finally burst through the other side. And there’s everybody, and they all start falling out laughing because I look panicked. My hard hat is on sideways, my goggles are down around my neck.”
Or the time during the Woolsey fire that he had to help a member of the crew down Boney Mountain in Malibu.
“He’s tired, his legs are wobbly. I take his tool from him, which was a shovel. And he grabs the top of my backpack, and I slowly start to descend.”
McKinney has plenty of stories, too. Like the time he and his crew had been working for hours in the heat, hacking away at brush and trees with packs of heavy gear on their backs, when another wind-whipped blaze suddenly erupted in the distance.
“I’m just standing and I’m looking at it. You can kind of see the smoke start to rise and rise. I felt the wind start to pick up because,” he said pausing for emphasis, “you’ve got to be aware of the wind directions on you at any moment.”
Soon, McKinney said he was bent over once again, clearing brush with a chain saw — only this time, in the face of 30-foot flames.
“I never sweated that much in my life,” he said.
Both McKinney and Hunt credit their time in fire camp with teaching them to be better human beings. They speak with pride — and a bit of surprise — about the residents who have offered thanks and food and water for saving their mansions. They brag about how they moved up the ranks of their respective fire crews.
For Hunt, in particular, who has been in and out of police custody for a variety of crimes since he was a teenager, the fire camp experience was life changing. He said he became a person whom his mother could once again be proud of.
“You become an entirely different person from who you were,” he said. “So it’s difficult. I’d love it if they just said, ‘Hey, come on down and report.’”
All it would take is one phone call — and the promise of a salary that actually befits a firefighter. Not even the risk of contracting COVID-19 is a deterrent.
“Just give us two radios,” McKinney said, as Hunt nodded. “We’ll make it happen.”
First Gov. Gavin Newsom has to make it happen and sign AB 2147.

And what a remarkable, chaotic and uncertain year this has been for the Golden State and those who govern it.
This was, after all, a legislative session that was cut short — twice — by lawmakers either concerned by the spread of COVID-19 or when individuals in the two houses tested positive for the virus.
When the final gavel falls in the state Capitol before midnight, hundreds of bills will have been sent to the desk ofGov. Gavin Newsomfor action by the end of September. Both houses of the Legislature churned through the weekend and into the night on Sunday to consider bills on a variety of topics.
Bills moving through the state Senate did so with 10 of the upper house’s membersdebating and voting on bills from their homes. The lawmakers, all Republicans, were quarantined after attending an in-person gathering withSen. Brian Jones(R-Santee),who tested positive for the coronavirus.And of all members to be sidelined, it was Jones — the most vocal critic in the spring of efforts to allow remote voting, who sought out a legal opinion that the practice could be illegal.
Here are a few of the bills that had cleared both houses by the time lawmakers adjourned late Sunday night:
Meanwhile, lawmakers appear to have struck a deal on one of the year’s most closely watched issues,a reprieve on evictions for renters who have run short on moneyduring the pandemic. That proposal will be voted on Monday.
But not all last-minute efforts came up successful. Lawmakers had toabandon a $3-billion bond proposal to fund wildfire, climate and economic recovery needsafter significant opposition from utility companies whose customers would have to underwrite the effort with monthly fees.
Newsom’s newest approach to control when California counties loosen their pandemic rules on businesses and services officially kicks off on Monday. Gone are the watchlists of counties with higher cases and limited hospital beds; in its place is a four-tiered system based on colors.
Purple is bad. Red is better. Orange is a little better still. Yellow is the best.
In reconfiguring the rules, it seems clear that the former system wasn’t working the way state officials wanted it to. The governor admitted as much in rolling out the news Friday.
“We’re going to be more stubborn this time,” Newsom said in explaining what would be different in this iteration of monitoring and possibly loosening the restrictions.

Why Trump Is Playing up Fears of Violence
President Trumpand his allies are trying to depict protests over racial injustice as a law-and-order campaign issue, attacking Democratic leaders, refusing to condemn deadly vigilante violence and touting a purportedly tranquil “Donald Trump’s America.” Former Vice PresidentJoe Bidenhas accused Trump of inciting violence for political gain.

Against the backdrop of a still-raging coronavirus outbreak, the White House has offered the clearest signal yet of a calculatedGOP strategy of exploiting voter fears of violenceas the campaign against Biden enters the final stretch and Trump trails in the polls.
The strategy closely resembles the one Trump employed, unsuccessfully, in the 2018 midterm election, when he spent weeks warning of “caravans” of migrants trying to reach the U.S. border with Mexico. This time, the effort is aimed at portraying urban Democratic strongholds as threatening and lawless.
Trump plans a visit Tuesday to Kenosha, Wis., whereprotests have flaredfor the last week over the police shooting ofJacob Blake, a 29-year-old Black man who was left paralyzed, and where a teenage gunman who reportedly idolized law enforcement has been charged in two deaths. Administration officials provided no indication that Trump wants to meet with Blake’s family, with whom Biden and his running mate, Sen.Kamala Harris, have talked at length.
Amid a stream of inflammatory tweets and retweets Sunday, the president castigated the mayor of Portland, Ore., where a caravan of Trump supporters late Saturday confronted protesters. One man, identified as amember of a right-wing group,was shot dead.
Biden condemned the violence, “whether on the left or the right,” and has called on Trump to do the same.
Reopening 2.0
Starting today, California is implementinga new system designed to rekindle the economy, which has been decimated by the COVID-19 pandemic.
For most of the state, the new rules won’t result in many immediate changes, because restaurant dining, religious services, gyms and fitness centers, movie theaters and museums will remain restricted to outdoors only in the vast majority of counties. But hair salons and barbershops can open statewide, including for indoor services if they adhere to requirements for social distancing and employees wear masks and follow other health-related mandates. All retail stores and shopping malls also are permitted to open, at a maximum of 25% capacity, state officials said.
Gov.Gavin Newsomunveiled the plan Friday. It’s a four-tier system in which counties must show consistent success in stemming the transmission of the coronavirus before allowing businesses greater flexibility to reopen and group activities to resume. And it appears to take a far more cautious approach than the governor’s first effort in the spring, when his decision to rapidly ease restrictions led to such a major surge in cases that he ordered another statewide shutdown.

"In this year’s atypical California fire season, politicians find the blame game won’t work",https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2020-08-31/george-skelton-fire-season-blame,2020-08-31,"SACRAMENTO —This wildfire season is different. And it must be frustrating for many politicians. It certainly is for pundits. That’s because there is no one really to blame.
A cardinal rule of politics and punditry is to clearly state the problem, point out who’s at fault and say what should be done about it.
But during the current wildfires, no human apparently is at fault. It’s Mother Nature’s handiwork — mostly her lightning strikes. No mortal can turn those  fire bolts off.
OK, we could prepare better for them and should.
But so far, it doesn’t seem to be Pacific Gas & Electric Co.’s fault. Unlike in past fire seasons, the utility’s old power equipment isn’t tumbling down and igniting flammable brush or dead trees it should have cleared.
There haven’t been any nutty arsonists out there that we know about. Nor careless campers who left their breakfast fires smoldering. No smokers tossing lit cigarette butts from their cars.
No, this time it’s Mother Nature’s fault.
Many scientists and public officials also cite global warming, including Gov. Gavin Newsom. They may be right. But lightning was around long before we started burning fossil fuel.
“I’m not in denial about climate change,” Newsom told reporters last week. “If you don’t believe in climate change, come to the state of California and we will educate you….
“Not just wildfires — droughts and floods. Snowpack [diminishing] and the like. I could go on.”
Newsom’s predecessor, four-term Gov. Jerry Brown, was a fatalist about wildfires.
California
The California Legislature abandoned a bill to extend a fee on utility customers to generate $500 million for wildfire projects.
While inspecting devastation from Butte County’s cataclysmic Camp fire in 2018, Brown was asked by a reporter, “How do we curb these fires?”
“You know,” Brown answered, “we’ve had fires for long before the Europeans showed up here. And our Indigenous people had a different way of living with nature. For 10,000 years, there were never more than 300,000 [people in California]. Now we have 40 million and we have a totally different situation.
“So it’s not one thing. It’s people. It’s how people live, it’s where they live and it’s the changing climate…. And the truth is … we’re going to have more difficulties,” he said. “Things are not going to get better. They’re going to get more challenging because of the continuing alternation in the climate … lack of moisture, early snowmelt and faster winds, the whole thing.”
Unquestionably we need to slow global warming. But to do that we need a U.S. president who doesn’t think climate change is a socialist hoax.
Whatever we Californians and all Americans do to wean ourselves off fossil fuel, however, it isn’t going to stop wildfires for the foreseeable future.
Stephen J. Pyne, a professor emeritus at Arizona State University who specializes in environmental history, put it this way in a recentTimes opinion piece:
“Until we began binge-burning fossil fuels, we had managed to live with fire. We need to relearn how to coexist with it because it isn’t going away — it can’t. Unlike for COVID-19, no fire vaccine is possible.
“At this point in our fire-powered warming world, even as we ratchet down fossil fuel burning, landscape fires will likely ratchet up…. We can ready ourselves to truly manage fire or scramble in blustering incredulity,” he wrote. “But the fires are coming.”
The August lightning strikes, however, were freakish and relatively rare.
Lightning like that doesn’t happen every season. In one three-day span, there were 12,000 lightning strikes in California — an average of 167 an hour.
“That’s an unusual amount of lightning,” says Nick Schuler, deputy chief at the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection.
Climate & Environment
As Southern Californians increasingly flock to the mountains for relief from a recent heat wave and months-long coronavirus restrictions, hundreds of illegal campfires have sprung up in dispersed campsites.
Other big lightning bursts came in 2008 and 1987, Schuler says. But this year’s was bigger than both of those. And this summer, the vegetation is especially flammable because of an abnormally dry winter.
President Trump habitually accuses California Democrats offailing to clear the forestsof dead trees and brush that fuel fires. Newsom “has done a terrible job of forest management,” the Republican president claims.
That’s typical Trump. The federal government owns and manages 57% of California’s 33 million acres of forests. The state owns only 2.2% and local governments less than 1%. Private landowners have about 40%. The feds should clean up their own mess.
No argument, California governments and private landowners all have been irresponsibly tardy in clearing out fire-fueling brush and dead timber. The state government has been trying to catch up during the last three years. It has cleaned up 90,000 acres. That’s a good start, but it’s just a small stick of kindling compared with what’s out there ready to burn.
Forest cleaning should be a top state priority and it apparently is. There are plans to annually reduce fire fuel on 1 million acres in partnership with the federal government.
Newsom, Brown and legislators deserve credit for recently hopping to it on firefighting and prevention.
They’ve purchased 12 twin-engine Black Hawk helicopters retrofitted for firefighting, replacing old Vietnam War-era single-engine Huey birds. The Black Hawks fly faster and can dump more water.
Cal Fire has added 13 new fire engines and 858 more firefighters — plus a lot of new technology such as wildfire alert cameras.
Since Newsom took office, the state has spent about $500 million beefing up Cal Fire.
As of Friday, 14,600 firefighters — state, local and federal — using 2,400 fire engines and more than 100 aircraft were battling more than two dozen major blazes.
The state’s long-term solution: Keep doing what it’s doing — only much more of it.

"California Democrats scuttle wildfire utility fee plan, turn to Newsom in last-ditch effort",https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2020-08-30/california-democrats-face-legislative-battle-over-utility-fee-wildfires-climate-change-newsom,2020-08-30,"SACRAMENTO —Facing heavy opposition, California lawmakers have scrapped a last-minute bill toextend fees for utility customersand plan to replace it with a more modest call for $500 million in emergency fire response and mitigation efforts.
The new proposal requires Gov. Gavin Newsom to waive a state law that prevents legislators from amending bills in the final hours before the Legislature adjourns for the year.
The decision to abandon Assembly Bill 1659 came just five days after lawmakers introduced the measure. The legislation’s reliance on a 10-year extension of fees on utility bills — at a cost of more than $3 billion to customers — to pay for wildfire mitigation and climate projects drew sharp criticism from ratepayer advocates and utilities.
The new plan, pushed by Democrats in the state Senate, would instead tap into proceeds from California’s cap-and-trade program — which requires companies to buy permits to release  greenhouse gas emissions — as well as state general fund revenues and a 2018 bond measure. The money would be spent on a variety of efforts aimed at addressing wildfires and climate change, including cooling centers, back-up solar power, emergency shelters, warning and detection systems,hardening projects, forest health and workforce training.
“We’ve had 1.7 million acres that have already burned this year and we haven’t even gotten to the peak of wildfire season,” said state Sen. Ben Allen (D-Santa Monica), who is among the Democrats pushing the proposal. “Either we’re going to continue spending money to fight the fires and help communities rebuild and address the devastation after the fact, or we can try to act now to be more proactive.”
But Allen and other proponents would have to overcome major hurdles to pass the proposal with less than two days left in the legislative year.
Proposition 54, a 2016 voter-approved amendment to the California Constitution, requires a bill to be in print for 72 hours before the Legislature passes it. With lawmakers required to adjourn for the year Monday night, the new proposal would require  Newsom to submit a statement to the Legislature saying it’s necessary to address a state of emergency.
If Newsom takes action, legislators plan to make the bill a majority-vote proposal tied to the state budget, an easier threshold to clear than the two-thirds vote that would have been required to pass AB 1659.
Newsom probably won’t intervene unless the Senate and Assembly reach an agreement to support the new proposal.
Senate President Pro Tem Toni Atkins (D-San Diego) said she was prepared to negotiate.
Atkins “is not taking a position on any specific proposal, but is willing and ready to engage to get something done in the next 36 hours,” her office said in a statement.
But Assembly Speaker Anthony Rendon (D-Lakewood) questioned whether the bill was necessary to address the state’s wildfire emergency.
“Given the governor’s office has not yet engaged with us on this proposal, I don’t believe it meets the bar for a waiver of the 72-hour rule,” Rendon said in a statement. “This rule is designed to provide transparency, and overturning it should be done sparingly. Wildfire prevention and climate change are important issues in California, and deserve thoughtful discussion to figure out potential funding proposals.”
Assemblyman Chris Holden (D-Pasadena), the chair of the Assembly utilities and energy committee, strongly objected to the use of ratepayer-raised  funds for AB 1659. Through a staff member, Holden declined to comment on the replacement proposal because he said he had not been able to review the bill‘s language.
Other key members of the Assembly, including Richard Bloom (D-Santa Monica), who introduced AB 1659, and Jim Wood (D-Healdsburg), did not immediately respond to  requests for comment.
A spokesman for Newsom declined to comment on the new proposal and whether he would waive the 72-hour rule.
The decision to pare back the original spending plan under AB 1659 comes after the bill faced fierce pushback from businesses and ratepayer advocates.
A coalition of business groups — including the California Chamber of Commerce, the California Farm Bureau Federation, the Western States Petroleum Assn. and other influential groups — sent a letter to the Senate last week opposing the bill for requiring customers of the state’s three largest investor-owned utilities to pay for projects unrelated to their electrical service.
The business groups wrote that “choosing to fund bits and pieces of the state’s overall wildfire response and non-utility programs and projects solely on the backs of California’s ratepayers at a time when businesses are closing, unemployment is skyrocketing, and our economy is faltering is not an appropriate solution.”
AB 1659 would have added 10 years to an existing utility fee, already extended last year by lawmakers to 2035 to pay for wildfire damages caused by utility equipment. The extension would have cost ratepayers 96 cents a month, or more than $3 billion over 10 years, for bonds used to pay for wildfire prevention work.
Newsom and the Legislature approved AB 1054 to establish the wildfire fund last summer amid pressure from Wall Street to reduce the utility industry’s liability for  damage linked to their electrical poles and equipment. The law made it easier for utilities to avoid being on the hook for wildfire damages through a new safety certification process and created a $21-billion fund as an additional shield against losses from blazes linked to their equipment.
Pacific Gas & Electric and San Diego Gas & Electric have opposed this year’s proposal, AB 1659, saying their customers shouldn’t “shoulder the financial burden for activities and public projects that benefit the entire state.”
“AB 1659 would impose extra costs on IOU [investor-owned utility] customers, which would be viewed negatively by lenders, ratings agencies, and capital markets, further exacerbating the already challenged credit ratings of the state’s IOUs,” the utilities wrote in the Aug. 27 letter. “AB 1659 therefore threatens to undermine the collaborative progress made to restore the financial health of the state’s IOUs, while imposing an additional, unnecessary burden on IOU customers.”
The utilities are expected to remain neutral on the replacement proposal because it does not require an extension of the ratepayer fee.
Mark Toney, executive director of the Utility Reform Network, ripped AB 1659 in a legislative hearing last week, saying the bill broke a promise the state made last year when it said ratepayer costs for wildfires would be capped at $10.5 billion — the cost of the 15-year fee increase for the wildfire fund.
“AB 1659 is nothing short of a last-minute backroom deal to loot ratepayers,” Toney said.

Illegal campfires spark fear of wildfire in California forests,https://www.latimes.com/environment/story/2020-08-30/illegal-campfires-spark-fear-of-wildfire-in-southern-california-forests,2020-08-30,"Big Bear Lake, Calif. —As darkness fell on a campsite in a well-hidden glen in the San Bernardino Mountains recently, the soft clatter of a laptop keyboard on a portable picnic table was joined by the sound of footsteps trampling undergrowth as two U.S. Forest Rangers strode forward and said, in turn, “Howdy.”
The rangers methodically scanned the tiny, lonely patch of Holcomb Valley wilderness in which Jonathan Hong, 31, of Beverly Hills, was composing the opening chapters of his first science fiction novel. It didn’t take long for the rangers to find what they were looking for.
Nodding toward a nearby mound of charred wood encircled by softball-sized rocks, Ranger Chon Bribiescas asked, “Is that a campfire over there?”
“Yeah. It’s just a small one,” Hong, replied nervously, adding, “it’s not mine.”
Instantly and quietly, Bribiescas and Zachary Behrens set to work. With their bare hands, they gauged the heat of the campfire site – it was cold – then began picking up the rocks and tossing them into the forest.
“We can’t allow campfire rings like this to become reusable,” Behrens said, spreading dirt over the ashes with his boots.
Moments later, they were back in their pickups and trundling down a one-lane dirt road cutting through Holcomb Valley, about five miles north of Big Bear Lake, on a night patrol to eliminate illegal campfires.
As Southern Californians increasingly flock to the mountains for relief from a recent heat wave and months-long coronavirus restrictions, hundreds of illegal campfires have sprung up in dispersed campsites. Unlike developed campsites, which offer groomed campgrounds, toilet facilities and often fire rings or grills, dispersed campsites are simply forested areas where visitors pitch a tent.
So far this year, forest officials have documented a 270% increase in illegal campfires in the San Bernardino National Forest, the most densely populated and heavily used national forest in the United States. That’s  a rise from 189 between January and August in 2019 to about 700 during the same period in 2020.
Under current fire restrictions, building a campfire is allowed only in fire rings provided by the Forest Service in some developed recreation sites. The same goes for wood or charcoal barbecues.
But the problem persists amid afire seasonlike no other. As the pine air filled with the snarling sounds of vehicles clawing for traction along the badly rutted dirt roads leading into Holcomb Valley, Northern California was under a state of emergency as firefighters battled more than 560 lightning-stoked wildfires across the state that have claimed the lives of at least seven people, destroyed hundreds of homes and scorched more than 1 million acres.
California
A small Cessna soared high above the Mojave Desert recently, its engine growling in the choppy morning air.
The tensions play out every day as thousands of vacationers stream into this popular resort community looking forward to an alpine escape of crisp mountain air, cool forest trails and cozy campfires.
Instead, they are greeted by a grim reality: By 1 p.m. on a recent Friday, all 13 campgrounds in the San Bernardino range were filled, and traffic along the main route into the community was clogged due to an onslaught of SUVs and four-wheel drive vehicles loaded with coolers, bicycles, fishing and climbing gear and barbecues.
“These visitors have two choices,” Behrens, 39, said. “They can turn around and head home, or search for a suitable place to camp for free in, say, Holcomb Valley.”
Many tourists think the effort is worth it. They have driven more than a hundred miles in their own vehicles to get to Big Bear Lake, a city of 6,000 year-round residents and summer crowds of more than 100,000 on Labor Day weekend. Today is their day.
But because of the increasing tourist pressure, “weekdays are now like weekends and weekends are like major holidays,” Behrens said. “And with the surge of visitors has come an uptick in illegal campfires all over the forest.”
Forest officials are embroiled in the issue across the state, as increasing numbers of summer travelers are avoiding planes and cruise ships and placing more value on forest recreation near their homes, blurring the distinctions between urban life and deep woods.
On a recent Friday in the San Bernardino forest, rangers discovered 11 illegal fire rings. In most cases, nearby campers insisted they had no idea who built them. In any case, Bribiescas left a written warning that said, “Friendly reminder: No campfires or charcoal bbq. Thank you.”
At sunrise the following morning, they smothered a few dozen more.
Then there was Andrew Dewlaney, 28, a middle school physical education teacher struggling with online teaching, and his wife Coree, 29, a nurse at the John F. Kennedy Memorial Hospital emergency room, who worried that their hard-won weekend getaway in Holcomb Valley was about to come to an abrupt end when the rangers walked up and said, in turn, “Hello there.”
It was 109 degrees in the shade with high humidity when they left their home in Indio, Calif., that morning, they said. The traffic congestion they encountered in Big Bear Lake that afternoon was a crushing disappointment. After several hours of searching unsuccessfully for an available space at a forest service campground, they ventured into Holcomb Valley.
The good news: They had a permit to use a propane-powered fire pit filled with lava rocks that they brought to provide a smoke-free semblance of a wood-fueled campfire. The bad news: the device was sitting on a thick bed of highly flammable pine needles.
But the rangers were sympathetic. Bribiescas used a rake to remove the needles from a patch of soil roughly five feet in diameter. “You should be good to go now,” he said.
Overall, the rangers encountered little resistance during their campfire patrol under a big sky filled with owls and a dazzle of stars. Whether they prevented a potentially catastrophic wildfire was anyone’s guess.
For Behrens, Bribiescas and Smith, it was all part of a day’s work in Southern California’s urban national forest.

Why California’s 2020 lightning fires got so big so fast,https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2020-08-30/why-californias-2020-lightning-fires-have-grown-bigger-and-faster-than-any-in-state-history,2020-08-30,"When state fire authorities announced recently that the CZU Lightning Complex fire had quadrupled in size in just one day, an audible gasp rose from the audience.
Although lightning fires have been scorching the state since prehistoric times, the speed with which the SCU and LNU lightning complex fires became the second- and third-largest blazes ever recorded in California has startled emergency officials and strained firefighting resources. The fires have killed seven people, destroyed more than 2,100 buildings and made air unhealthy across the Bay Area.
And things may only get worse in the future, experts say.
“There’s a direct relationship between heat and fire, and increasing heat is inevitable for at least a few decades,” said Michael Gerrard, director of Columbia University’s Sabin Center for Climate Change Law. “If you like 2020, you’re going to love 2050.”
So why have this year’s fires burned more than 1.4 million acres of the state’s scenic coastal mountains and hills surrounding wine country? After all, the Lightning Siege of 2008, when nearly 800,000 acres burned, was the first time the National Guard had been called in to help in 40 years as resources were stretched to the limit.
The answer is complicated.
The destiny of all wildfires is shaped by the fire behavior triangle — fuel, weather and topography — according to Craig Clements, a professor at San Jose State’s Fire Weather Research Laboratory.
But there were additional factors involved in this most recent outbreak. A summer heat wave magnified by climate change combined with tropical moisture and storm energy to create thunderstorms. The resulting lightning strikes pelted a region with a history of difficult firefighting and another area that’s seen numerous fires in the recent past.
The state- and locally-maintained coastal mountains in Central California, where the CZU  Lightning Complex is burning, have a history of challenging firefighters. In 2016, in Monterey County north of the current fire, a firefighter died helping contain the stubbornSoberanes fire, which burned 50 homes while flames lived for months in the range’s steep canyons and impassable terrain.
In 2003, south of Livermore, where a part of the SCU Lightning Complex is now burning, 53 firefighters were overrun in the middle of the night and used their shelters in what may have been the second-largest shelter deployment by crews in U.S. history, Clements said.
In both instances, just as is happening now,  temperatures did not drop significantly overnight nor was any ocean moisture reintroduced into the landscape’s higher elevations. In the summer, a high-pressure system settles over the Pacific and rotates, steering warm, dry air over the coastal range’s upper elevations while squeezing cool, moist air into the marine layer below, said San Jose State atmospheric scientist Alison Bridger.
“It’s basically why we don’t get rain in the summer,” she said.
Throw in an extreme heat wave, and fire risk rises significantly.
“The fact we got such extremely large, fast destructive fires without any offshore winds is very unusual,” said UCLA climate scientist Daniel Swain. “All of this hints at something which we know to be true ... the state of the vegetation, the state of the fuels was pretty extraordinary.”
In fact, most of the areas burning in the three lightning complex fires are considered to be in moderate to severe drought, according to the most recent U.S. Drought Monitor reportreleased Thursday.Huge chunks of each fire’s footprint include areas that haven’t seen fires in decades and were jackpots of dead and dry tinder.
“Unfortunately, as the climate continues to warm, the table is being set for these extreme fires more often,” Swain said. “It means the ceiling on how bad these fires can be is continuing to increase.”
The night that the hundreds-of-miles-wide lightning storm set all these fires in motion, a “heat burst” before sunrise hit parts of wine country, sending predawn temperatures in areas such as Travis Air Force Base from 80 to 100 degrees in under two hours. While experts say it  probably didn’t have a direct impact on the fires, it certainly didn’t help matters and foreshadowed the challenging conditions to come.
From Tuesday to Wednesday, winds flowed downslope into the Sacramento Valley from the mountains between Oregon and California, shedding moisture along the way. When they hit the wine country hills, they were bone dry and influenced the fire’s explosive growth, said National Weather Service meteorologist Cory Miller. The LNU Lightning Complex fire grew tenfold in 36 hours, from 12,200 acres the morning of Aug. 18 to 124,000 acres the following night, according to the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection.
Sarah Johnson and the Emerald Hills Horse Ranch, in Winters, were in the fire’s path.
Johnson, 29, is originally from Ohio and knows thunderstorms, so two weeks ago she kicked back in a hammock to enjoy a flavor of the Midwest as lightning flashed across the horizon around Lake Berryessa and  Mt. Vaca.
But soon, the storms were replaced with smoke, and then falling ash. Johnson and her boyfriend were glued to their phones, listening to scanner traffic from first responders about the fire’s movements. The California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection website was working only intermittently, overwhelmed by a surge in web traffic from around the globe.
As the fire made its late-night surge Aug. 18 and 19, Johnson’s boyfriend’s phone began ringing incessantly, the ranch’s boarders trying to reach him to warn him of the incoming fire.
The couple woke up and sprung into action, waking neighbors, loading up horses as trailers arrived and helping to knock down small spot fires that dotted the ranch pasture. The ranch lost power sometime during the scramble.
“It was incredibly windy and smoky and you could see a fire tornado forming, and the rate of spread was incredible,” Johnson said. “The fire was just so bright, that’s how we were able to see everything.”
Over the next several hours, their neighbors’ homes burned. The fire was fast and the county’s emergency alert system didn’t reach many of them until it was too late, if at all, Johnson said.
“I remember at one point I just stopped and looked and said, ‘Where are all the fire trucks?’ and it was just another surreal moment and I realized that nobody was coming,” she said.
There’s a concern that as these fires hit the same areas again and again, they’ll permanently change California, and not for the better.
A moderate fire can clear out underbrush and competing trees, giving a healthy forest room to breathe. But if it visits again and again — as has happened  in parts of Napa County in recent years — those native grasses and plants give up the fight and invasive plants move in, similar towhat’s happened in Southern California.Oftentimes those new species can spread fire faster.
California has choices to make since fire is inevitable and megafires are increasingly possible, said Gerrard, the Columbia climate law director. Building codes can be updated. Utility infrastructure can be modernized and better regulated. Decisions on where homes are built and how forests are managed can be made with fire risk and native ecology in mind.
“It’s very much like managed retreat on the coastline,” Gerrard said. “The hope is that recurrent, related disasters will be a wake-up call.”

"Pouring wine as Napa burns: Between the fires and the pandemic, who will visit when we reopen?",https://www.latimes.com/opinion/story/2020-08-30/op-ed-wine-napa-burns-pandemic,2020-08-30,"It’s 112 degrees. I’m blinking sweat out of my eyes as I try to breathe through my mask and talk to my guests about the 2017 Cabernet Sauvignon in their glasses. I’m bothered that the heat and breathless air don’t seem to trouble them, but I continue on, talking about the distinguishing factors of that vintage: severe heat and wildfires.
With COVID-19, wine tastings in Napa Valley can  happen only outside. During the unprecedented heat spell in early August, I was advised to stay hydrated, take breaks, and watch for signs for heat exhaustion and heatstroke in both myself and our guests. Each day my co-workers and I carried on, pouring wine and pretending that we were superhumans who weren’t affected by the weather.
Besides our safety, the only thing that mattered was guest satisfaction. Even in a crisis, wealthy tourists stay wealthy. They keep us in business, and in return, we don’t bring the mood down.
Under the beating sun, I tell my guests: “This year looks like a great vintage. We just hope for a drama-free harvest.”
Three days later, on the morning of our commencement picking of Sauvignon Blanc, the Hennessey fire started on the east side of St.  Helena, just four miles from the winery. Since then it has evolved into theLNU Lightning Fire Complex, burning more than 350,000 acres anddestroying800 structures, including my co-worker’s home in the Berryessa Highlands. As I write this, the fire is still burning, smoke taints the air and an eerie orange glow streams through my window.
I came to Napa Valley a year and a half ago to pursue my passion for wine on the pretext of the California Dream. My job, as a wine educator for a high-end winery, should be one of the best around. But I might have moved here at the worst time in recent history.
The last few years have been plagued with unthinkable heat waves and the apocalyptic wildfires that have ravaged the local wine industry: smoke-tainted grapes, evacuations during harvest, rolling blackouts and crippled tourism. Napa Valley is experiencing the reality of climate change: It is hotter and drier every year. What didn’t burn this year will burn next year, and so on.
If that wasn’t bad enough, COVID-19 has dramatically strained the wine industry. When wineries in Napa Valleyreopened in mid-Juneafter being closed for three months, many hospitality staff members did not return to work because they were older (and more susceptible to the virus) or because they were permanently laid off. For many small wineries, tasting room sales and wine club sign-ups are their only form of business. But even the larger ones that sell wine to restaurants have seen their sales come to a screeching halt. Online sales are the saving grace for many brands, but they’re not always enough to keep the business afloat — especially when the latest fires are causing tourism to decline again.
California
Sonoma County wineries are reopening to an altered landscape
It’s hard to sell wine when the weather forecast is smoky, it’s raining ash and the global pandemic keeps people home.
The people who live here are simply exhausted. We are tired of the anxiety, the packing and unpacking, and the fear of losing our loved ones and our homes. Besides, the region is pricing out its workers. Most people who work at wineries live far from them in less expensive towns such as Vacaville, Fairfield, Windsor, Healdsburg and Santa Rosa.
Yet those locations have suffered the most from wildfires. I asked my co-workers why anyone would choose to live on the outskirts of the valley where rolling dry grasslands are prone to fires. It seemed obvious that those homes are risky investments considering the danger. But I was repeatedly told the same thing: It wasn’t like this until a few years ago.
Each year we wait patiently for the annual grape harvest, which starts in mid-August. Normally, this is the most exciting time to be in wine country — there are endless parties, extravagant dinners, grape-stomping photo shoots and the promise of a great vintage. But things are different now. Napa Valley is deflated as many wineries question how badly the grapes have been tainted by smoke, and if it’s possible to use the fruit at all. Vineyard workers are risking their health — due to unhealthful air quality and a pandemic — because they can’t afford not to.
The winery I work for has been closed for a week because of bad air quality and its location in an evacuation zone. When we reopen, who will want to visit?

Fourth death confirmed as fires continue to torch Northern California,https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2020-09-30/wildfires-devastation-california-fires-wine-country,2020-10-01,"Another person has died as a result of the fast-moving Zogg fire burning in Shasta County, officials announced Wednesday, raising the blaze’s death toll to four.
The latest victim, a man who was not identified, was taken to a hospital with significant burns Sunday, Sheriff Eric Magrini said.
“He was transported to a hospital, and we received word last night that he succumbed to his injuries,” Magrini said during a briefing. “So, again, our condolences go out to that family.”
Thirty people have now died in the unprecedented firestorms that have pummeled California this year. Half of thosevictims perishedin the North Complex fire, which laid waste to small mountain communities in Butte County northeast of Oroville this month.
The Zogg fire has burned more than 55,000 acres and destroyed 147 structures since igniting Sunday afternoon near the community of Igo, about nine miles southwest of Redding. Theblazeis now 9% contained.
“We expect that containment to increase every day,” said Sean Kavanaugh, an incident commander with the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection. “There may be slow increments as we move forward.”
Reinforcements have also arrived to buttress the battle against the blaze, he said during a briefing. As of Wednesday, 117 engines were on the scene, up from 81; and 23 hand crews, up from about 12.
The fire is still threatening more than 1,500 structures, and crews were challenged again Wednesday by hot, dry conditions in the burn area.
“We’re feeling good about where we’re sitting, but we still have a lot of work that’s going to take place,” Kavanaugh said. “It’s really going to be weather-dependent, also.”
#ZoggFireMap 9.30.20@ShastaSheriff@211Norcalpic.twitter.com/wRrxGkUcna
The forecast is also top of mind for those assigned to the Glass fire in Northern California’s wine country.
Though crews have made progress — reporting 2% containment as of Wednesday evening — officials warned that winds are expected to pick up again this week, posing a new challenge to those on the front lines. Since igniting early Sunday, the fire has grown to cover more than 51,200 acres.
A red flag warning will be in effect for the North Bay mountains and other areas near where the fire is burning from 1 p.m. Thursday to 6 p.m. Friday, with “critically dry and breezy conditions” expected,according to theNational Weather Service’s San Francisco Bay Area office.
Fire officials said they are preparing for the potentially adverse weather and warned residents to stay alert about possible updates regarding evacuations.
“Now’s the time for our firefighters to buckle down,” said Billy See, Cal Fire incident commander.
During a Wednesday briefing, See said, “we’re looking at a very similar wind event” as when “this fire first started moving out three days ago.”
“Mother Nature is something that we don’t try to guess, so we’re preparing for the worst-case scenario and we’re hoping for the best,” he said.
Santa Rosa Fire Chief Tony Gossner noted that “this wind event is going to be serious enough for everyone to pay attention.”
“It’s very important that we keep all new fire-starts to a minimum so we can concentrate on what we’ve got going on now,” he said.
The Glass fire has destroyed 36 and 107 homes in Sonoma and Napa counties, respectively. One commercial building in Sonoma and five in Napa have been razed.
In Sonoma County, those numbers will almost certainly rise, said 1st District Supervisor Susan Gorin, who toured her community Tuesday afternoon. A firefighter told Gorin at least one neighborhood was “completely wiped out.”
California
The rapid spread of the 42,000-acre Glass fire has raised concerns about the fate of the wineries in Napa and Sonoma counties.
“There are some significant areas of total devastation up and down the hills and off Highway 12 and Calistoga Road and St. Helena Road,” she said. “You can clearly see where the homes have been burned. The ash is white. The debris of life — a washer, dryer, sometimes patio furniture — is still standing. For the most part, you know exactly where there was a home there and a family that loved living there.”
She took a deep breath, let out a sigh, then concluded: “It’s been a pretty exhausting morning for me emotionally…. Once again the 1st District was impacted by fire.”
Gorin lost her home tothe 2017 Tubbs fire,and her new home is still being rebuilt, she said.
In Sonoma County alone, the Glass fire has already caused damage to land and property totaling at least $8 million — without accounting for personnel costs, county Emergency Management Director Christopher Godley said Tuesday.
The blaze has also taken a toll on some of the region’s renowned wineries, which have already had to contend with several recent bad fire seasons as well asthe coronavirusoutbreak.
“I can’t begin to express my frustration with these continuing wildfires around here,” said Vince Tofanelli, owner of the Tofanelli Family Vineyard, a Calistoga winery devastated by the fire. “It’s very heartbreaking.”
The fire was still threatening 26,290 structures as of Wednesday evening, according to Cal Fire.

California’s wineries in Napa and Sonoma are being hammered on multiple fronts. Vintners are growing weary.
Despite the threat, authorities have been able to lift or reduce some evacuation ordersin NapaandSonoma counties,downgrading mandatory evacuations to warnings Tuesday for areas including Summerfield, Spring Lake and parts of the communities of Melita and Calistoga.
Evacuation orders remain in place for the hills on both sides of the northern Napa Valley, flanking Calistoga and St. Helena, and parts of the east side of the Silverado Trail.
Such directives also remain elsewhere in Calistoga, and authorities ordered residents Tuesday evening to evacuate from an area west of Highway 29, extending to the Sonoma County line and bounded by Diamond Mountain Road and Petrified Forest Road.
On Wednesday morning, a new evacuation warning was issued for all areas between Silverado Trail and Highway 29, from Larkmead Lane to Zinfandel Lane, as well as all areas west of Highway 29 from Whitehall Lane to Madrona Avenue.

Once again, wind-driven flames tear through Santa Rosa, as wildfires besiege California’s wine country.
California has been undernear-constant siegeby wildfires for nearly two months as conflagrations of historic size, intensity and destruction have ignited and spread throughout the state.
Five of the six largest fires recorded in California have started since August. Though crews have largely hemmed in three of those massive blazes, two —the Creek firein the Sierra foothills northeast of Fresno, and theAugust Complex fireburning in and around the Mendocino, Shasta-Trinity and Six Rivers national forests — remained just under 50% contained as of Wednesday.
At roughly 949,000 acres, the August Complex is more than twice as large as any fire inthe state’s modern history.The Creek fire, at just over 307,000 acres, is the sixth-largest.
This year, more than 8,100 wildfires have burned in excess of 3.8 million acres statewide, according to Cal Fire. The fire season has “broken almost every record there is to break,” officialswrote on Twitter,and the state is likely to continue “to see increased wildfire activity.”
Though many of this year’s fires weresparked by a fierce lightning storm,officials are still investigating the causes of others, including the Glass and Zogg fires.
KTVU-TV Channel 2, a Bay Area television station,reported that Cal Fire investigatorshave been canvassing and examining burn patterns at a hillside vineyard near the wine country town of St. Helena. A spokesman for Cal Fire would not comment on its investigation. A spokeswoman for the owner of the vineyard, Cakebread Cellars, told the television station that the winery was “cooperating with and providing information to Cal Fire.”
Authorities overseeing the response to the Zogg fire urged residents Wednesday not to jump to conclusions or share unverified gossip about how that blaze might have ignited.
“This is still an active fire and this is an active investigation, and these investigations take time,” Magrini said. “There’s been a lot of speculation, a lot of rumors. Our office has received several reports of a lot of misinformation that’s out there.
“Please,” he added later in the briefing, “do not go to your Facebook pages and listen to what has not been confirmed by any of the officials here today.”

Kentucky attorney general is granted a delay in releasing Breonna Taylor grand jury documents,https://www.latimes.com/world-nation/story/2020-09-30/grand-jury-transcripts-breonna-taylor-case-released,2020-09-30,"LOUISVILLE, Ky. —A judge granted a motion filed by Kentucky Atty. Gen. Daniel Cameron on Wednesday to delay the release of transcripts and audio from a grand jury’s inquiry into the police killing of Breonna Taylor.
It’s the latest legal turn in a case that has helped propel the national discourse about race and policing.
Cameron, who filed a motion early Wednesday, asked for a one-week delay so that his office could redact the personal information of people who were part of the proceedings. The circuit court judge, Ann Bailey Smith, granted a delay until Friday for the documents from the 2½ days of proceedings.
Normally kept secret, the documents and audio recordings were set to be made public  after an unidentified grand juror filed a separate court motion this week asking a judge to release the record of the proceedings.
The motion filed by the juror argued that there was a “compelling public interest” to have the grand jury record released. In addition, it accuses Cameron, who was also the special prosecutor in the case, of “using the grand jury to deflect accountability and responsibility for [the indictment] decisions.”
Last week, Cameronannounced the grand jury’s decisionnot to hold the three officers — Myles Cosgrove, Jonathan Mattingly and Brett Hankison — involved in the shooting legally responsible for the killing of Taylor, a 26-year-old Black woman, in Louisville. The decision stirred outrage across the country. Cameron disclosed this week that his office had not given the panel the option to consider murder or lesser charges in Taylor’s death.
World & Nation
Many Black residents of Louisville, Ky., are sadly familiar with marginalization and otherness, and have watched a system that vows to uphold justice fall short of its promise.
A Jefferson County circuit court judge ruled in favor of the motion to make public a record of the grand jury’s deliberations, and Cameron has said he will comply by releasing documents from the  proceedings.
Officers burst into Taylor’s apartment March 13 with a “no knock” warrant and fired multiple times after her boyfriend, Kenneth Walker — who did not know who was entering the home — shot and wounded one of the officers. Taylor, who had been sleeping at the time, was shot multiple times and died instantly.
Hankison, since dismissed from the Louisville Metro Police Department, was charged by the grand jury with wanton endangerment for firing rounds that struck neighboring apartments — a legal determination, critics say, that served as a further insult to the value of Taylor’s life.
In an interview with alocal news stationlate Tuesday, Cameron defended the decision not to give the grand jury the option of recommending murder or lesser charges, saying it was “not appropriate.”
“The charge that we could prove at trial, beyond reasonable doubt, was for wanton endangerment against Mr. Hankison,” Cameron said. “Myles Cosgrove and Jonathan Mattingly were fired upon by Mr. Walker. They were justified in returning fire.”
In the days since the announcement, attorneys for Taylor and for Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear, a Democrat, have called onCameron to release the transcriptsamid more than 120 days of protests that have shuttered the city. The largely peaceful demonstrations have served as a relentless rally against police brutality toward Black people.
World & Nation
Breonna Taylor’s mother says her daughter was failed by a lack of adequate investigation into the fatal shooting by Louisville police officers.
On Wednesday afternoon, Jackie Reynolds, a local college student, sat on a sidewalk near Jefferson Square Park in downtown Louisville, the site of massive demonstrations in recent months. She has been among those protesting.
“In time, the truth will come out,” Reynolds said, noting she is not concerned about the delay in releasing the grand jury transcripts. “We’re not going to stop marching until these officers are charged with murdering Breonna.”
Reynolds was among nearly a dozen other protesters in the park, where a large mural in honor of Taylor is located.
Benjamin Crump, a civil rights attorney representing Taylor’s family, said that “since the grand jury decision was announced, we’ve been saying that Daniel Cameron clearly failed to present a comprehensive case that supported justice for Breonna.
“That conclusion is supported by the grand juror who came forward to say that the attorney general misrepresented the grand jury’s deliberations,” Crump said.
He added: “In America, law-abiding citizens — including Black citizens — have the right to live peacefully in their homes, without police breaking down their doors in the middle of the night, and they have a right to protect themselves and their property from intruders.”
World & Nation
Armed Black groups like the Minnesota Freedom Fighters work to protect the streets as calls for racial justice mount.
Cameron, the state’s first Black attorney general, has faced criticism from some Black activists here.
“You are a coward, you are a sellout,” Tamika Mallory, a leading activist, said of Cameron during a news conference last week.
In the local television interview, Cameron responded to criticism of how he has handled the case.
“Some of these folks, they seek to divide and push hatred … and to stir the pot,” he said. “Just because I might have a different philosophy should not discredit the fact I am a Black man.”
Since Taylor’s death six months ago, the city has sought to implement changes and ease tensions.
Local elected officials have enacted a ban, known as Breonna’s Law, on “no knock” warrants like the one officers used to force their way into her residence. The city is also creating an independent civilian police-review board with subpoena power, designed to foster greater accountability and transparency within the Police Department.
Earlier this month, the city settled awrongful-death lawsuitwith Taylor’s family for $12 million, the highest amount ever paid out by the city in a case of its kind.

California’s worst fire season in modern history continued to wreak havoc Tuesday, with the Glass fire raging in Sonoma and Napa counties and the Zogg fire swelling in the rugged terrain near Redding.
In a new story, my colleagues Joseph Serna and Paige St. John wrote about how wine country became an epicenter of California fires in recent years. More than 9,000 structures were lost and dozens of people were killed in 2017, when fires swept through Santa Rosa and surrounding communities. And last year, the Kincade fire menaced the region for weeks. Fires once again exploded in the region  Sunday and have continued to rage.
[Read the story:“How wine country became the epicenter for fires in California”in the Los Angeles Times]
Paige and Joe cited a number of factors for the nightmarish increase in fires in the region, which have left some residents fleeing their homes on an annual basis. Those factors include increased development from the suburbs to the wildlands, which has carried the fire risks of utility infrastructure along with it, as well as our changing climate.
[Read more:“California’s wine country faces a triple threat: COVID-19, smoke and now raging fires”in the Los Angeles Times]
In recent days, I have thought often ofa tweet from Eric Wittmershaus, the deputy managing editor of the Santa Rosa Press-Democrat. He wrote a few weeks ago that when people ask him about climate change, he tells them that he doesn’t recall covering any major wildfires during his first 14 years at the Press-Democrat. “Now, it’s every year. Sometimes more than once.”
[See also:“Fleeing the Glass fire? Here’s how to get help”from the Santa Rosa Press-Democrat]
Further north,the fast-moving Zogg firecontinued to cut a destructive path through Shasta County. The fire, which started Sunday afternoon about nine miles southwest of Redding, has killed three and destroyed at least 146 structures.
And now,here’s what’s happening across California:
As if America had not already suffered enough:Chaos reigned supreme as President Trump and Joe Biden clashed Tuesday night in their first face-to-face debate. Fox News host Chris Wallacewas pannedfor his inability to prevent the presidential debate from going out of control. Shouting over each other, the candidates repeatedly accused the other of lying and incompetence.
Personal attacks flew fast and furious, with Trump repeating false claims about Biden’s son, and Biden at one point calling Trump “the worst president America has ever had.”
When asked whether he would condemn white supremacists, Trump refused to categorically do so, and told the Proud Boys, a right-wing extremist group, to “stand back and stand by.”
And as for the California of it all, the president again harped on the state’s need to improve forest management to prevent California fires, even though only 3% of California forestland is managed by the state. The entity responsiblefor most of California’s forestlandis actually the federal government, which manages more than half of it. Trump also called Gov. GavinNewsom’s long-term planto phase out gas-powered vehicles in California “crazy.”Los Angeles Times

Today’sCalifornia memorycomes fromEric Jay Sonnenschein:
It was 1984, the year of the L.A. Olympics, when America won nearly everything. I’d lost patience with New Mexico. So my girlfriend and I sped west for L.A. We crashed for the night at a motel in Hollywood where loud curses, crashing furniture, gunshots or engine backfire kept us up all night. We prayed the lock would keep out predators but the door shook with every violent sound effect and we knew nothing would save us. When morning came, we were still alive, so we drove up the Pacific Coast Highway, where the sun blinded us on every hairpin turn.

Fires again ravage a California wine industry already reeling. ‘It’s very heartbreaking’,https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2020-09-30/napa-sonoma-wineries-destroyed-smoke-damage,2020-09-30,"CALISTOGA, Calif.  —The owners of the Castello di Amorosa winery spent $40 million re-creating a 13th century Tuscan castle in Napa Valley, replete with stone turrets and towers, and a small drawbridge.
When theGlass firehit Amorosa and other Napa wineries Sunday and Monday,  it did little damage to the front of the castle. But it badly scorched the back building and heated up a stone wall on a processing facility where thousands of wine bottles were stored, many now ruined.
Tuesday afternoon, the winery’s employees banded together to clear out and salvage what they could from the back storage area and offices above it. Vanessa Close, the castle’s accounting manager, hunched over a bin in the parking lot and sorted through piles of office supplies and paperwork.
“It’s really unbelievable,” Close said about the winery’s partial devastation. “You think, it’s stone, how could that happen?”
It was yet another blow for a region that has suffered through several bad fire seasons, starting in 2017. This year, the pandemic closed tasting rooms, wildfire smoke threatened multimillion-dollar vintages, and now raging blazes have created a triple whammy for many who call California’s famed “wine country” home.
“I’m numb,” said Vince Tofanelli, owner of the Tofanelli Family Vineyard, another winery in Calistoga devastated by the Glass fire.
California
Fire stormed through California’s wine country Sunday night, destroying numerous homes and forcing thousands to flee, including in areas devastated by the Tubbs fire in 2017.
Tofanelli’s grandparents purchased the vineyard’s first parcel in 1929, but by Tuesday morning, all of its structures had been destroyed — including an old redwood barn, a water tower, two homes and outbuildings, he said.
He hadn’t been back to the property since evacuating  Sunday but was crossing his fingers that the fire hadn’t ravaged the vines.
“I can’t begin to express my frustration with these continuing wildfires around here,” he said. “It’s very heartbreaking.”
The Glass fire ignited just before 4 a.m. Sunday and quickly ballooned to 40,000 acres in the span of just two days. At0% containment, it  straddles  Napa and Sonoma counties, which together are home to more than 800 wineries, many family-owned.
It is the fourth major fire to hit the region since the Tubbs fire torethrough Santa Rosain 2017, and many in the area are beginning to grow weary.
“We are all dealing with significant fire fatigue,” said Sonoma County Sheriff Mark Essick during a news conference Tuesday. “Many people are feeling the effects, and many people are evacuating and have evacuated multiple times.”
But it’s not only the flames and frequent threat of evacuation. Tourism numbers took a significant hit after the Tubbs fire, and some experts now fear that regular ash and smoke will begin to damagethe taste of their varietals.
“Smoke can drastically affect the quality of wine made from affected grapes,” said Lewis Perdue, publisher and executive editor of Wine Industry Insight. “It is called smoke taint and doesdrastically affect the qualityof wine. So much so, that many wineries have decided not to make a 2020 vintage.”
Climate change, which has been linked to much of California’s currentapocalyptic wildfire season, can also take a toll on sensitive grapes,particularly Pinot Noir,which depends on the cool fogs that roll into the San Francisco Bay from the Pacific Ocean.
“I’ve seen climate change on a real basis in my 60 years of farming,” Tofanelli said. “I have varietals that don’t do as well now as they did before, because they’re more heat sensitive. They’re going to have to plant different varietals to adapt.”
On Tuesday, a thick blanket of smoke covered Napa Valley, the haze descending from the winding mountain roads into downtown Calistoga, where the town seemed all but closed  due to evacuation orders. Ash peppered cars and vineyards, and the smell of soot clung to the air.
Spot fires flared on the sides of State Route 29, the main gateway to Napa, and they popped up on winding roads where trees smoldered. Some timbers fell over as cars drove past.
The Glass fire is now one of more than 20 wildfires burning in California, in what has been called the mostdestructive wildfire seasonin the state’s history. Although the region has endured fires before, this one is coming  amid a global pandemic that has already hammered its tourism and economy.
“Restaurants all over the nation were shutting down, which affects how much wine they move, which affects sales from our wineries,” said Michael Haney, executive director of the Sonoma County Vintners, an industry group that represents more than 300 local wineries.
This week’s firedestroyed the restaurantat the Meadowood Estate, a food destination with a coveted three stars from the Michelin Guide.
Haney said many wineries saw visitor numbers dip during the early months of the shutdown, just as they did after the Tubbs fire.
But those numbers were starting to improve with social distancing guidelines and approval of outdoor gatherings, he said. It was the year’s early wildfire season that quickly put a stop to that progress.
Yet Haney said there was at least one cause for hope: Napa and Sonoma vintners are adaptable.
“While these fires, and of course the pandemic, are something extraordinary in everyone’s life, they have had to mitigate and address challenges for decades and generations,” Haney said of the region’s winemakers. “I have had nobody — and I mean not one grower or vintner — say ‘I’m out of here.’”
Bob Knebel, president and CEO of Rombauer Vineyard in Napa, felt similarly optimistic. The Glass fire spared his property, which sits on a road  now flanked by smoldering brush and trees.
“We’re here for the long run, and we love it here,” he said.
A lifelong Californian, Knebel said the word “wildfire” could be synonymous with “renewal.” Everything  burned by wildfires will turn into ashen fertilizer, which will lead to a beautiful green spring, he said.
Georg Salzner,  president of Castello di Amorosa, said about 120,000 bottles — or 10% of the winery’s stored product — was damaged by the Glass fire, representing each type of wine they make.

“You’re never prepared for something like that,” he said, standing in front of the wreckage. “We did have fires in the last four years and we’re kind of getting used to it, but when it really happens to you it’s much worse.”
Still, he said, he won’t let the fire get in the way of making wine and continuing to serve customers. “I think people will want to come,” he said.
Tofanelli is now anxiously awaiting an update on the status of his grapes, but he is similarly hopeful.
“I’m standing here with an N-95 mask in the smoke and trying to assess what I’m going to be doing,” he said. “But if the vineyard’s still here, I imagine I’ll be out there next February, pruning the vines and plugging along.”

"The Sports Report: Playoffs continue for Lakers, start for Dodgers",https://www.latimes.com/sports/newsletter/2020-09-30/playoffs-lakers-dodgers-sports-report,2020-09-30,"Howdy, I’m your host, Houston Mitchell. Let’s get right to the news.
Broderick Turneron the Lakers: The uber-competitive Pat Riley that Magic Johnson knows from winning four championships when Riley was the coach of the Showtime Lakers in the 1980s is the same man who helped rebuild the Miami Heat into a contender for the 2020 NBA title.

The driven Riley that Johnson knows, who became one of the best executives in the NBA, winning two championships with LeBron James when he called Miami home from 2010 to 2014, is the same Riley who’s pulling for the Heat to defeat James in the NBA Finals.
“Pat is a competitor, so he wants to win,” Johnson said. “I think now even more so because you got the Lakers team he used to coach and you got LeBron, a guy you won two championships with in Miami. But we have to remember that by nature he’s such a competitive guy. Even if it wasn’t us, he would want to win so bad.”
Johnson, who recruited James to win a title while he was the Lakers’ president of basketball operations for a little more than two years, wants to see James realize the vision the two shared. He also yearns to see owner Jeanie Buss follow in the giant footsteps of her late dad, Jerry Buss, and bring home a championship.
And, of course, to do it in honor of Kobe Bryant after the Lakers legend’s stunning death this year.
“I want it for Jeanie because I want her to make her father proud, make the fans proud, herself proud as one of the first women in sports to win a title,” Johnson said. “And then LeBron. For him to say, ‘Hey Earvin, I’m taking this leap of faith that you guys are going to do what you say you are going to do to put the proper pieces around.’ I want it for him too because I think that he has got us back to where we belong as an organization and fans can be proud of the things that he’s promised, to get us here to the championship, and let’s see if he can deliver the championship. It would be a great story.
“Also too, we have endured over the year. They can make Dr. Buss happy in heaven and make Kobe happy in heaven too. They are probably sitting down trading notes right now — and Chick Hearn is in the middle of it as well.”

Jorge Castilloon the Dodgers: The Dodgers lost one of the 20 series on their 60-game regular-season schedule. If they lose one in October, that rampage they completed Sunday — most runs scored, second-fewest runs allowed, highest winning percentage by any team since 1954, an eighth consecutive National League West title — will become a footnote in another failed attempt to win the World Series.
Those are the stakes. This expanded 16-team postseason format didn’t appropriately reward the Dodgers’ dominance in a season played without fans and with a possible COVID-19 outbreak looming every day while players and coaches addressed social issues beyond baseball. Too many teams qualified. The three-game wild-card series added a layer of unprecedented variance. The randomness of the playoffs was amplified. But it’s the same for every club and it doesn’t change this fact: The Dodgers are the overwhelming favorites to win their first championship since 1988. Anything short of reaching that peak would be a massive disappointment.
“It’s kind of World Series-or-bust every year,” Dodgers manager Dave Roberts said. “This year, I think, certainly would be more special if it could even be possible. But we’ve all gone through a lot. The whole industry has.”

Sam Farmeron the NFL: The NFL news out of Tennessee on Tuesday — that three Titans players and five other members of the team tested positive for COVID-19 — quickly morphed into a test of the league’s flexibility, creativity and resolve.
It was a code red for a league that had enjoyed three uninterrupted weeks of football, a somewhat surprising development in a sport where social distancing is impossible and players are not sequestered.
Both the Titans and the Minnesota Vikings, who played each other Sunday, announced they were immediately suspending all in-person activities at their facilities this week in an abundance of caution.
But time is of the essence, because both teams need to practice and prepare for their Sunday games. The Titans host Pittsburgh in a showdown of undefeated teams and the Vikings play at Houston, with each team looking for its first victory.
First of all, there are no tidy solutions for moving Minnesota’s game at Houston, so it’s a particularly good thing that no Vikings have tested positive so far.
There is more wiggle room with Pittsburgh-Tennessee. The league’s first choice, of course, is to keep the game on the schedule for Sunday. But how much time do the Titans need to adequately prepare? In these high-intensity weeks, every lost minute counts.
There is the possibility the game could be played Monday night. The league has made those moves before when games have been disrupted by hurricanes, wildfires and other natural disasters.MLB PLAYOFFS SCHEDULEWild-card roundAll times PacificAmerican League

"Glass fire grows nearly fourfold in a day, burning 80 homes in Napa, Sonoma counties",https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2020-09-29/glass-fire-quadruples-in-size-burning-80-homes-in-napa-valley,2020-09-30,"The rapid spread of the nearly 50,000-acre Glass fire has raised concerns about the fate of the wineries in Napa and Sonoma counties.
CALISTOGA, Calif. —At least 80 homes have been destroyed in Napa and Sonoma counties asthe Glass firecontinues to rampage through Northern California’s wine country.
The blaze had burned 46,600 acres as of Tuesday evening — nearly quadrupling in size since Monday morning — with just 2% containment.
The fire destroyed 52 residences in Napa County and 28 in Sonoma County, said Erick Hernandez, a public information officer with the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection. Two commercial structures in Napa County have been burned.
California
Thousands of people are under evacuation orders as multiple fires burn unchecked in Napa, Sonoma and Shasta counties.
The fire burned rapidly Sunday through Napa Valley’s Silverado Trail, raising concerns about the fate of the area’s famed wineries.

Napa and Sonoma counties are home to more than 800 wineries, according to their tourism associations, and many are family owned.
One building that was lost was the distinctive stone structure at the Chateau Boswell Winery in St. Helena, which marked its 40th anniversary last year.
Officials said Monday evening that at least eight wineries were damaged.
The winding road to Chateau Boswell was flanked by smoldering brush and trees Tuesday morning as firefighters worked to quell the flames scorching the region.
Just off Silverado Trail, downed power lines and burned cars blocked one of the mountain paths to the winery, known for its Cabernet, Chardonnay and Pinot Noir.
The vineyard’s entrance was roped off by yellow sheriff’s tape. Singed cypress trees towered over the driveway that now leads to scorched rubble and earth.
California
California’s wineries in Napa and Sonoma are being hammered on multiple fronts. Vintners are growing weary.
Santa Rosa Fire Chief Tony Gossner said Tuesday that his department had called in all possible personnel to fight the Glass fire.
“Every available firefighter that could work came to work,” he said during a briefing, noting that crews’ top priorities for Tuesday are extinguishing the fire and maintaining perimeter control.
Of particular focus is the mountainous area between Calistoga and Angwin.
“We’re going to be in this for a couple of weeks,” Gossner said. “It’s going to be long, and it’s going to be painful for those that are dealing with it. So take a deep breath, take care of yourself and take care of your neighbors.”
Though Cal Fire officials could not immediately confirm the acreage breakdown by county, they emphasized that California’s wildfire-fighting infrastructure is “one of the strongest and most diverse in the nation.”
“This is a large fire,” Cal Fire Unit Chief Shana Jones said. “We’re at 42,000 acres covering two counties. That is a lot of territory, and it’s a lot of work.”
California
Once again, wind-driven flames tear through Santa Rosa, as wildfires besiege California’s wine country.
Although no injuries have been confirmed, tens of thousands of people have been forced to flee from the fire.
Sonoma County Sheriff’s Department spokesman Sgt. Spencer Crum said some 68,000 residents had been ordered to leave.
Authorities on Tuesday downgraded mandatory evacuation orders to warnings for areas that included Summerfield, Spring Lake and parts of the communities of Melita and Calistoga.
In Melita, about five miles east of Santa Rosa, evacuation orders were reduced to warnings for the area west of Calistoga Road, south of Melita and north of Montgomery Drive.
The entire city of Calistoga, with a population of slightly more than 5,000 people, was ordered to evacuate Monday evening; authorities scaled back the order to a warning for the area west and north of Mountain Hawk Drive between Highway 12 and San Ramon Way, as well as the area west of San Ramon Way.
Evacuation orders remain in place elsewhere in Calistoga, and on Tuesday evening, authorities ordered residents in an area southeast of Calistoga to evacuate from an area west of State Route 29, extending to the Sonoma County line and bounded by Diamond Mountain Road and Petrified Forest Road.
Evacuation orders remain in place for the hills on both sides of the northern Napa Valley, flanking Calistoga and St. Helena, and parts of the east side of the Silverado Trail.
Officials have urged residents to comply with those directives — saying some of those who refused to leave had to be rescued from their homes later, placing further strain on law enforcement and public safety personnel already stretched thin byCalifornia’s historic fire season.
“Thedynamics of climate change, the dynamics as it relates to the lack of forest management over the last century, have created ... real concern as it relates to the spread of these wildfires in ferocious ways,” Gov. Gavin Newsom said Monday.
GLASS FIRE - early this morning (Silverado Trail just outside St. Helena). Never underestimate how quickly a fire can spread. Reminder, an evacuation order means there’s an immediate threat to life. Be safe.pic.twitter.com/5tVbIMvn61
Newsom has declared a state of emergency in Napa and Sonoma counties — as well as Shasta County, where the Zogg firehas burned more than40,000 acres and killed three people.
The governor has also requested a disaster declaration from the federal government, which would bring increased aid to Los Angeles, Fresno, Madera, Mendocino, San Bernardino, San Diego and Siskiyou counties.
The Glass fire is the latest to besiege Northern California’s wildfire-weary wine country.
Dozens of people were killed and more than 9,000 structures were lost in 2017, when fires swept through Santa Rosa and surrounding communities. Last year, the Kincade fire menaced the region for weeks, putting nearly 100,000 people under evacuation orders.More than 50%of Lake County to the north of Santa Rosa has burned in the last decade.
Sonoma County Sheriff Mark Essick said that “we are all dealing with significant fire fatigue.”
“This is the fourth major fire in our community since 2017,” he said Tuesday. “Many people are feeling the effects, and many people are evacuating and have evacuated multiple times.”
California
Fire stormed through California’s wine country Sunday night, destroying numerous homes and forcing thousands to flee, including in areas devastated by the Tubbs fire in 2017.
For many, the latest fire carries with it anunwelcome wave of memories: the terror of having to evacuate and the uncertainty of not knowing whether their homes were spared from the flames.
“The Tubbs trauma is real,” said Rincon Valley resident Randi Cornwall, referring to the 2017 fire thatdevastated the region. “When you have seen fire move fast before, you know to get the hell out before traffic backs up and fire is licking at your cars.”
Some, however, were hesitant to flee. Monday morning, Ben Illia stood in the frontyard of the gray ranch house where he grew up. He was watering down the landscape with a hose.
A veteran of the Tubbs fire, he had no plans to leave unless “I see flames coming over the hill,” he said.
Tucked into the hillside off Highway 29 in Calistoga, a young man reached for a thick hose attached to a water tank at the back of his truck and doused the spot fire licking the brush around a neighbor’s home.
The man, who declined to give his name, said he lived about a mile away and had defended the area from flames in the past. Dressed in a T-shirt, with a cigarette resting between his lips, he waited for his water tank to refill, then aimed the hose at a tree that had caught fire.
Other residents had fled from the home behind him after hanging a tag that read “EVACUATED” in red letters.
Down below, at the edge of the highway, Joe Ortega watched the flames char a parcel of land that he said a real estate agent he knows had put up for sale. Burning trees crackled behind him.
The 61-year-old said he had been checking on friends’ and family’s houses and properties since 4:30 a.m., when he made the rest of his family evacuate from their Calistoga home.
Ortega said he planned to head back into town later in the day to hand out Red Bull and water to firefighters.
“I’m a rebel,” he laughed as fire engines whizzed by.

"After dozens died in 2017, Santa Rosa residents were prepared when flames returned this week",https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2020-09-29/santa-rosa-residents-were-ready-to-run-when-flames-hit,2020-09-29,"SANTA ROSA —Like almost everyone else in the Coffey Park neighborhood, Maria del Carmen lost her home three years ago.
“I still get panic attacks,” the 33-year-old Santa Rosa resident said Monday. Terror shoots through her when she smells smoke, “until I can figure out there’s no fire here. Then I can relax.”
She learned of the 2017 Tubbs firewhen she woke in the night and looked out her window, so it was without question that when she rebuilt, Del Carmen signed up for emergency Nixle alerts on her cellphone. She stayed most of Sunday night, packing and monitoring fire news.
The midnight urban evacuation that Sonoma County officials feared would be a repeat of2017’s exodusinstead went relatively smoothly, Del Carmen said, “because of all the Nixles. Everyone gets them.”
She, however, left even without an evacuation warning for her home — leaving before dawn and heading early into work to a retirement center whose residents were being moved to a community shelter in nearby Petaluma.
California
Once again, wind-driven flames tear through Santa Rosa, as wildfires besiege California’s wine country.
The fire that burned into Santa Rosa on Sunday and Monday was reminiscent of the 2017 firestorms that destroyed thousands of homes and killed dozens of people. But this fire has been far less destructive, and there have been no reports of fatalities.
And there are clear signs that officials and residents learned from 2017, with warnings to get out being issued — and followed — more effectively. On Sunday night and Monday morning, thousands fled to safety, jamming Highway 12.
A lot has changed in three years, Del Carmen said.
“It [the evacuation] was better, even though the fire did come faster.”
Sitting on the sidewalk outside the Petaluma shelter, Rose, a 32-year-old Santa Rosa resident who did not want to give her last name, similarly relied on the text alerts. “A friend said, ‘You have to subscribe to Nixle,’ ” she said.
When a loud emergency alert also blasted on her phone, Rose made the decision to leave, though it was an hour before she could find a way out of town. She doesn’t drive. “I really relied on a complete stranger,” she said.
California
California’s wine county is once again facing threats from wildfires.
Most of Santa Rosa remained open for business Monday, with ash flakes drifting out of the overhead smoke, cars driving with their lights on and major stores running air-filtration machines full blast at their entrances.
Santa Rosa Mayor Tom Schwedhelm credited seasoned residents and emergency planners for an unpanicked evacuation. The main road on the fire-side of town became gridlocked midway through the night, but in less than two hours, traffic flowed again.
Police Chief Rainer Navarro called out the entire department at the very start. Navarro said he had more than 130 officers using pre-planned evacuation routes and directing traffic, while others picked up garden hoses to help quench spot fires until outside fire agencies could arrive.
Public warnings and orders to leave began within half an hour of the realization that embers from the Glass fire had kicked off a new blaze headed over Mt. Hood toward Santa Rosa.
The action plan differed greatly from that of the Tubbs Fire, when Sonoma County officials delayed warnings out of fear that a mass evacuation would cause panic and block the narrow roads that firefighters needed to access.
“This isn’t our first rodeo experiencing this, and I think everyone now understands we have to work together to do this safely and effectively,” Schwedhelm said.

"As crews battle Martindale fire, heat and dry conditions keep L.A. County on edge",https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2020-09-29/critically-dry-conditions-la-county-martindale-fire,2020-09-29,"As temperatures in Southern California spike amid a fall heat wave, fears offire weathercontinue.
Hot, dry conditions are fueling large blazes and small brush fires across Los Angeles County.
On Monday afternoon, theMartindale firebroke out in the Bouquet Canyon area of the Santa Clarita Valley and jumped to more than 200 acres in less than 30 minutes, the U.S. Forest Service said.
Evacuation orderswere issued from the Bouquet Reservoir Dam south to Mile Marker 11.5, and fire crews deployed more than a dozen aircraft in an aerial attack against the fire.
Crews worked overnight to build containment lines, and as of Tuesday morning, the blaze was 40% contained, officials said.
Earlier in the day, a small brush fire broke out near Acton amid red flag warnings across the region. The blaze, which ignited shortly before noon, was quickly stopped by the Los Angeles County Fire Department.
“Fire was held at 10 acres,” the Fire Departmentsaid in a tweet. “No structures damaged. No injuries to civilians or firefighters.”
Southeast of the Martindale fire, theformidable Bobcat firecontinues to burn. It ignited Sept. 6 in the Angeles National Forest and has chewed through more than 114,000 acres. As of Tuesday morning, it was 62% contained, but its smoldering status could shift at any time, officials said.
“The fuels are critically dry,” U.S. Forest Service spokesman Larry Smith said, “and until we get moisture, the fuels are going to remain critically dry. You’re going to continue to see smoke, continue to see flames.”
Estimates for the fire’s containment were pushed back Tuesday by one month, to Oct. 30,the Forest Service said. The San Bernardino County Sheriff’s Department said evacuations for the community of Wrightwood have been lifted.
High temperatures and low humidity that arrived in the region Monday are expected to last throughout the week, while gusty winds had mostly dissipated Tuesday.
Aheat advisoryhas been issued for valleys in Los Angeles and Ventura counties through 8 p.m. Thursday.
Wednesday will be the hottest day in the region, with temperatures reaching into the triple digits in the valleys and in the 80s and 90s along the coasts, theNational Weather Service said.
“Strong high pressure over the West Coast will dominate the weather for the week, bringing hot and dry conditions,” forecasters warned.
California
Once again, wind-driven flames tear through Santa Rosa, as wildfires besiege California’s wine country.
And although Monday’s red flag warning for gusty winds has been removed, officials said Angelenos should stay vigilant.
“The Bobcat fire started in a time when we didn’t have a red flag warning,” said Mike Wofford, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service in Oxnard. “It doesn’t require red flag conditions to get major fires.”
Wofford said other factors, such as dry grass and vegetation, can encourage the spread of a blaze.
“Things are drier than they would be normally this time of year,” he said. “We haven’t had rain in a long time, so that’s another part of the equation: These fuels are really ripe to go.”
Forest Service spokesman Andrew Mitchell said resources will remain on both the Bobcat and the Martindale fires Tuesday and throughout the week, noting there is always a potential for any fire to reignite.
Wofford agreed: “We can’t let our guard down for a long time,” he said.

Deadly Zogg fire remains out of control; reinforcements called in,https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2020-09-29/california-fire-that-killed-3-explodes-as-firefighters-struggle-with-lack-of-resources,2020-09-29,"ORINDA, Calif. —A deadly wildfire continued to carve a destructive path through Northern California’s Shasta County, swelling to more than 40,000 acres Tuesday.
The fast-moving Zogg fire — which started Sunday afternoon near the rural community of Igo, about nine miles southwest of Redding — has already been blamed for three deaths, destroyed 146 structures and prompted numerous evacuations in the area.
The blaze is still threatening more than 1,500 structures, fire officials said Tuesday morning.
“Light winds, high temperatures, low humidities and a lack of resources will continue to challenge firefighters today,” officials with the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection wrote inan incident report. “Firefighters will continue to focus on structure defense and increasing containment lines.”
Officials said Tuesday that reinforcements were being deployed to the scene, bolstering the arsenal available to stymie the blaze.
“We’ve had crews that are still on the line from when the fire started on Sunday,” said Sean Kavanaugh, a Cal Fire incident commander. “They’re in their third day out there; we’re trying to get those folks back in [for a break]. We do have resources that are coming from across the state to come help us.”
Issac Sanchez, a Cal Fire spokesman, said helicopters were dropping water and planes were dumping retardant on the fire.
A thick layer of smoke or clouds — he wasn’t sure which — was helping keep temperatures down, he said.
“The conditions are more favorable than they were two days ago and even from yesterday, but it is still warm, and the fire is still growing at this point,” Sanchez said.
The fire remained  uncontained Tuesday morning.
Details about the three people who died in the fire — including their names, ages and where they were found — have yet to be released. Shasta County Sheriff Eric Magrini said Monday that authorities were working to identify the victims and notify their families.
The Shasta County coroner declined to provide details about the victims.  A man who answered the telephone at the coroner’s office told a reporter to call back  Wednesday  and hung up.  Cal Fire said it had no information  about the fatalities.
California
Thousands of people are under evacuation orders as multiple fires burn unchecked in Napa, Sonoma and Shasta counties.
Deputies have evacuated 466 homes in the communities of Igo and Ono, displacing about 1,250 people, the sheriff said.
Magrini urged residents to heed orders to evacuate, noting that with this fast-moving blaze, “we’re not issuing warnings.”
Kavanaugh said deciding whether to order people to leave their homes was always a tough call, but “it’s a necessary evil that we have to do” when residents are potentially in harm’s way.
Cal Fire’s Shasta-Trinity Unit Chief Bret Gouvea called the fire “another tragedy here in Shasta County that we’re all too familiar with.”
It was only a little more than two years ago that theCarr fire swept throughthe area in and around Redding, ultimately charring 229,651 acres, killing eight people and consuming 1,614 structures.
“We have faced these tragedies in this county before,” Gouvea said during a briefing Monday. “One thing I know about Shasta County is it’s very resilient. Two years ago, this county dealt with massive loss, and I saw — from [fire] suppression all the way through recovery — the communities come together and quickly recover from these devastating incidents. We will be here until the end, and this county will recover from this.”
The sheer scope and scale of this year’s punishing fire season, however, hasstrained resources statewide— presenting another challenge for frontline firefighters.
The Zogg fire is one of more than two dozen major wildfires burning throughout California. Over 18,700 firefighters have been deployed to battle those blazes, according to Cal Fire.
Kavanaugh said he was hopeful that the arrival of additional personnel and equipment — as well as more cooperative weather — would boost the firefight.
“We’re starting to get a foothold, though. We’re starting to get the resources in,” he said. “That’s important, and we’ll see how we do the rest of the week.”
Thered flag conditionsthat persisted across much of Northern California over the weekend and Monday have vanished. However, “although gusty winds have dissipated, strong high pressure continues to keep temperatures above normal across much of the inland areas of California,” Cal Fire officials wrote in astatewide situation reportTuesday.
“With no significant precipitation in sight,” they warned, “California remains dry and ripe for wildfires.”
Fire season in California looks different these days. Temperatures are hotter. Fires are bigger and more destructive. Air quality is the worst in decades.
In recent days, dry and windy conditions helped fan the Zogg fire — as wellas the Glass firein Northern California’s wine country — and further fueled some of the major wildfires already burning statewide.
Among them is the behemoth August Complex fire, which grew by nearly 60,000 acres from Monday to Tuesday.
That fire — burning in and around the Mendocino, Shasta-Trinity and Six Rivers national forests, farther southwest of Redding —dwarfs all otherson record in California.
At roughly 938,000 acres, it’s more than twice as large as any fire in thestate’s modern history.
Cal Fire spokesman Daniel Berlant said the fire was driven Monday “specifically to the west and even to the southwest by those gusty winds.”
“Firefighters worked in extremely difficult terrain performing structure defense and constructing both indirect and direct containment lines,” he saidin a video briefingTuesday. “Overnight, the fire was extremely active ... making uphill, terrain-driven runs.”
The overall fire is 43% contained.
Dangerous fire weather persisted in other parts of the state Tuesday —with hot, dry conditionsfueling large blazes and small brush fires across Los Angeles County.
The Martindale fire broke out in the Bouquet Canyon area of the Santa Clarita Valley on Monday afternoon and jumped to more than 200 acres in less than 30 minutes, according to the U.S. Forest Service. As of Tuesday morning, the blaze was 40% contained, officials said.
Meanwhile, the Bobcat fire continues to burn in the Angeles National Forest. It has scorched more than 114,000 acres and is 62% contained.
California
The National Weather Service issued a red flag warning for the Los Angeles and Ventura county mountains and the Santa Clarita Valley.
More than 8,100 wildfires have been recorded in California just this year, burning in excess of 3.8 million acres.
The collective death toll from the historic firestorm now stands at 29. More than 7,000 structures have been destroyed.
On Tuesday morning, the Sacramento airport was packed with hundreds of  firefighters from across the country on their way in under mutual-aid agreements, highlighting how dependent California is on outside help with resources stretched thin.
“We’re dealing with some pretty extreme times in this state,” Gouvea said. “I think anybody can see that fire behavior, fire starts and the potential for large fire growth, the damaging fires, is prevalent. It’s historic times.”

Don’t believe self-serving messengers. Logging will not prevent destructive wildfires,https://www.latimes.com/opinion/story/2020-09-29/logging-wildfires-prevent-destruction,2020-09-29,"My community of Big Bear City, in the mountains east of Los Angeles, had a tense week recently. For a few nerve-racking days, the El Dorado fire, which has burned more than 20,000 acres in and around the San Bernardino National Forest, threatened to move our way.
The fire had seen little movement in the previous days, despite the fact that it was burning in dense forests with many dead trees and downed logs. Weather conditions had been cool and calm. Then things changed, and quickly. The weather shifted to hot, dry and windy. Right away, the El Dorado fire began spreading much more rapidly, toward Big Bear. We were notified to prepare for potential evacuation. Several days later, temperatures cooled again, winds died down and fire activity calmed.
Scenarios like this are playing out across the western United States, especially in California and Oregon. Many homes have been lost and, tragically, at least 30 lives too. Numerous communities have been forced to evacuate, displacing thousands of families. People are scared and looking for answers.
Meanwhile, as wildfires continue in parts of the West that don’t often burn, a troubling new form of climate change denial has crept into the public dialogue, and it is only increasing the threats to public safety.
The logging industry — and the Republican and Democratic politicians whose reelection campaigns it finances — are busy telling the press and the public that they should focus on “forest management” in remote wildlands, rather than on climate change and community wildfire preparedness. Joining this chorus is a group of agency and university scientists funded by the Trump administration.
Logging bills are now being promoted in Congress, ostensibly as solutions. Sens. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) and Steve Daines (R-Mont.) introduced a bill last month that would severely erode environmental laws to increase commercial logging in our national forests. Sen. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.) has introduced a bill that would triple funding to subsidize logging on federal forestlands.
Opinion Voices
We’ll never get ahead of these crises until we make the investments needed to reverse the course of climate change.
My colleagues and I conducted an ambitious scientific study on wildfire behavior and trends — one of the largest ever to analyze the factors that drive such fires. The study involved three decades of data and tens of millions of acres of forest fires across the American West.
What we found will not surprise most people who have an understanding of climate change. Weather and climate influence fire behaviormuch morethan other factors. Alarmingly, in forests where trees had been removed by logging, fires burned hotter and faster. That’s because removing trees reduces shade; creates hotter, drier and windier conditions; and causes highly combustible invasive grasses to spread.
Numerous other scientists — those who are not funded by logging corporations or the Trump administration — have found the same thing. Weather and climate factors are what mainly drive wildfire behavior. Fires do not tend to burn more intenselyin dense forests, or in forests withhigh numbersof dead trees.
Our large wildfires are driven in significant part by the climate crisis. We should respond by protecting vulnerable communities, not by allowing more logging in backcountry public forests, which does not stop fires and often makes them burn faster toward towns, as wesaw tragicallywith the Camp fire in Northern California.
This year’s wildfire season has brought the biggest and fastest runs we have seen. The Creek fire and the Bear fire, in the Sierra Nevada, traveled most rapidly through areas where extensive commercial logging had already occurred, often under the deceptive guise of “fuel reduction.”
More than 200 of the top climate, forest and fire scientists in the countryrecently warnedCongress that logging not only increases wildfire intensity and spread, but also emits more carbon into our atmosphere annually than our economy’s residential and commercial sectors combined. The scientists, myself included, urged policymakers to increase protection of forests from logging.
The only effective way to protect homes and lives from wildfires is to direct more resources toward creating fire-safe communities, improving warning systems and providing adequate evacuation assistance. Passing theWildfire Defense Act, introduced last year by Sen.Kamala Harris (D-Calif.), would be a step in the right direction.
The climate crisis is going to loom larger every year, threatening more lives and communities. This is no time to be misled by the self-serving claims of timber companies or the politicians and scientists whose funding is tied to them. Our priority should be public safety, not profits for the logging industry.

How wine country became the epicenter for fires in California,https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2020-09-29/how-wine-country-became-the-epicenter-for-fires-in-california,2020-09-29,"SANTA ROSA —Perhaps no part of California has felt more threatened by fire in recent years than the vast expanse of wine country and the Redwood Empire north of San Francisco.
More than 9,000 structures were lost and dozens of people were killed in 2017, when fires swept through Santa Rosa and surrounding communities. Last year, the Kincade fire menaced the region for weeks, putting nearly 100,000 people under evacuation orders. More than 50% ofLake County to the north of Santa Rosahas burned in the last decade.
For the record:
11:28 a.m. Sept. 29, 2020An earlier version of this story said the number of homes that burned in Santa Rosa’s Coffey Park in 2017 was 15,000. The correct number is 1,500.
You could be forgiven for thinking the region is due for a break. But on Sunday night, a fiery chain of events returned like a nightmare: a dry winter followed by a hot summer, which leads to a small grass fire on a windy autumn day spreading to an overgrown forest, where it feeds and transforms into a monster that races toward civilization.
Between the Tubbs and Nuns fires, which in 2017 burned almost 100,000 acres of trees and shrubs from Santa Rosa to Napa County to the east, and the 2019 Kincade fire, which scorched an additional 75,000 acres, most of the forested areas east of the city have seen flames sometime in the last few years.
But there was one wedge of land north-northeast of Santa Rosa — on the other side of Highway 12, above Trione-Annadel State Park, the Oakmont neighborhood and the Skyhawk Community development — that had no fire history going back 70 years.  Its foothills were covered with fast-burning grass, chaparral and oak, and its rugged canyons and ridgetops were dotted with drought-stricken conifers.
That’s the area that burned through Sunday into Monday, sending tens of thousands of residents fleeing once again, as a 20-acre spot fire graduated to a 50-acre runner, then grew from 2,500 acres to 11,000 acres overnight.
California
Thousands of people are under evacuation orders as multiple fires burn unchecked in Napa, Sonoma and Shasta counties.
“It truly was one of the areas we had established ... as the greatest threat to Santa Rosa, and it was something we’ve been trying to secure grants for, to aid in future vegetation management,” said the city’s assistant fire marshal, Paul Lowenthal.
While the cause of the fire is under investigation, officials said Monday it was possibly sparked by embers from the Glass fire on the other side of the Napa Valley.
Winds Sunday night were blowing steadily between 40 and 60 mph across the North Bay hills, with some gusts up to 65 mph, said National Weather Service meteorologist Anna Schneider.
While it wasn’t remarkably warm Sunday night, the air was extremely dry because it was being pulled over inland mountains from the hot, dry Great Basin, sapping it of any moisture as it traveled downslope and across the valley floor.
When the winds reached the 20-acre spot fire on the other side of the valley, they pushed it west toward Sonoma County and uphill into that one unburned area of the forest where it could flourish.
“When you have a drought year, critical fuel moistures, ignition and a wind event, then it’s just kind of the recipe,” said Craig Clements, a professor at San Jose State University’s Fire Weather Research Laboratory. “It doesn’t matter what’s happening — when you have wind like that, things are going to spread and spot long-distance.”
California
California’s wine county is once again facing threats from wildfires.
The counties north of San Francisco and Sacramento have been battered by fire in recent years, and there is much debate about why.
The two largest fires ever recorded in California occurred here: the current August Complex, which began in Tehama County and is now approaching 900,000 acres, and the Mendocino Complex, which burned nearly 450,000 acres in 2018.
All the flames have residents on edge whenever the winds pick up.
Maria del Carmen, 33, lost her home three years ago, as did almost everyone else living in Santa Rosa’s Coffey Park, where 1,500 homes burned in 2017.
“I still get panic attacks,” she said. Terror shoots through her when she smells smoke, “until I can figure out there’s no fire here. Then I can relax.”
She had learned of the Tubbs fire when she woke in the night and looked out her window. So it was without question when Del Carmen rebuilt that she would sign up for emergency Nixle alerts on her cellphone. She stayed up almost all Sunday night, monitoring fire news and packing.
California
Fire stormed through California’s wine country Sunday night, destroying numerous homes and forcing thousands to flee, including in areas devastated by the Tubbs fire in 2017.
She decided to leave even without an evacuation warning for her home — she took off before dawn and headed early to work at a retirement center whose residents were being moved to a community shelter in nearby Petaluma.
A lot has changed in three years, she said. The evacuation “was better, even though the fire did come faster.”
Social media posts showed Sonoma County residents holding up chunks of ash and scorched bark as big as their hands, telltale signs of a wind-driven fire. Whereas grass and chaparral burn quickly and completely, the gray pine or foothill pine is known for launching red-hot embers as it gets hotter, spreading the fire farther, Clements said.
“It’s so unpredictable; you don’t know how fast that fire can move,” said Tyree Vander, a spokesman with the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection. “It will outrun you.”
While Northern California is no stranger to autumn fires, they haven’t always carried the potential to grow as much as they do now, said LeRoy Westerling, a UC Merced professor who researches the interactions between climate, ecosystems and wildfires.
Development from the suburbs to the wildlands has increased and carried the fire risks of utility infrastructure along with it. But our changing climate and increasingly frequent fires are also a significant factor in the long term, according to Westerling. The state’s northern coast usually receives about two-thirds of California’s rainfall and has seen that turn into a relative trickle this year while the heat has been dialed up — a dangerous combination, he said.
“Climate change is giving [Northern California] a climate like Southern California, in terms of the degree of drying that the fuels undergo,” Westerling said.
If the fires come again and again, as they have the last few years, invasive species that are better adjusted to frequent fires will displace the native plants and trees that need more time to grow, Westerling warned.
But even as soon as next year, officials say, the fire threats could be back again for those in Santa Rosa.
“It did help clean up some of the forest as it burned through,” Lowenthal said of Sunday’s fire. “But I’ll just remind everyone: Grass grows back annually, and brush grows back pretty quick. ... Every year brings a new challenge.”

How landscape guru Mia Lehrer will fight fire with design for mountaintop think tank,https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/story/2020-09-29/mia-lehrer-berggruen-institute-landscape-architect-how-we-deal-with-fire,2020-09-29,"The policy think tank Berggruen Institute, whose plans for a campus in the Santa Monica Mountains wereannounced in 2016by its billionaire founder, Nicolas Berggruen, is set to announce the addition of landscape firmStudio-MLAto the design team on Tuesday morning.
Founded by designerMia Lehrer, the L.A.-based Studio-MLA has worked on master plans for the Los Angeles River and the Silver Lake Reservoir and has completed landscape designs for theNatural History Museum Los Angelesas well asSoFi Stadiumin Inglewood. Last week, Lehrer was named to the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power’sBoard of Commissioners(pending confirmation), a body that helps guide governance of the utility.
For the record:
2:13 p.m. May 6, 2021This article states that the Berggruen Institute pledged to leave 95% of its Santa Monica Mountains property undeveloped. The story should have noted that the pledge is in compliance with a preexisting legal easement on the property requiring that the open space be maintained.
Her firm  joins Swiss architects Herzog & de Meuron, working in concert with  the Gensler firm’s L.A. office, on the design and conception of Berggruen’s 450-acre site, which lies north of the Getty Center and Mount St. Mary’s University, west of the 405 Freeway.
Entertainment & Arts
The new SoFi Stadium will be home to the Rams and Chargers, but it holds the potential to be so much more to the communities around it.
Lehrer, whose studio has worked on previous projects in the Santa Monica Mountains, says the plan will provide important public access to the mountains — “the ability to get to the mountains, to see the view, to get a sense of the expansiveness.” The site will also provide an “opportunity to study what is the human connection to our ecology and how do we preserve that connection and how do we celebrate it.”
As part of the plan, the Berggruen Institute has pledged to leave 95% of the property undeveloped and make it accessible to the public via a network of trails.
While the land is wild, it is not pristine wilderness. Previously, the area had been zoned for construction of 28 estate homes (real estate parlance for what are generally known as McMansions). Before that, the site was employed as landfill, with some of its ridges graded during the 1980s.
Initial architectural plans for the institutewere released in 2017, showing a slender, one-story concrete structure elevated above the ridge on columns. At the time, architects Herzog & de Meuron said they intended to keep the footprint generally light.
“We want to make a contribution to a sustainable way of building,” said Jacques Herzog, one of the firm’s founders, in 2017, “not just another golf course or luxury five-star hotel.”
Last year, theGetty fire, sparked by a tree branch that fell on power lines in the Sepulveda Pass, consumed 745 acres and a dozen homes near the site of Berggruen’s complex. Lehrer says that the landscaping of these kinds of fragile ecosystems, at a time of explosive wildfires, is something she has been studying and working on for years.
“How do we deal with fire? How do we deal with resilience?” she says. “There is a lot of interesting new research.”
“I did a conference about three months ago about the importance of soil and how healthy soil can help slow down a fire,” she adds. “If it’s dry, then the fire goes into the cracks — fire moves differently on different soil. So the idea of what we have to do is make our soil healthier in our mountains.”
Her firm’s landscape for a children’s camp in Santa Clarita, in the vicinity of Magic Mountain, dealt with these issues. There, Studio-MLA used resilient vegetation with spacing between plantings and structures.
In 2013, thePowerhouse firetore through the area. “There was smoke damage,” says Lehrer. “Butnothing burned.”
These are some of the issues she will be tackling as her team prepares to conceive a design for the Berggruen property. “We’ll probably work with university professors and nonprofits to experiment,” she says.
Entertainment & Arts
Is Los Angeles still the sort of city that pursues hugely ambitious cultural and architectural projects?
In a statement, Berggruen says, “Mia’s deep knowledge of the Southern California environment and her ability to translate those qualities of place through community through design will help us create something extraordinary for Los Angeles.”
“Together, we will help to preserve and protects hundreds of acres of opens pace while providing increased access to nature for all.”

Newsletter: Fires besiege wine country and beyond,https://www.latimes.com/california/newsletter/2020-09-29/wine-country-fires-2020-essential-california,2020-09-29,"Another series of wildfires stormed California’s wine country overnight as flames destroyed numerous homes and other buildings in Napa and Sonoma counties and forced thousands to flee.
Good morning, and welcome to the Essential Californianewsletter. It’sTuesday, Sept. 29.I’m Christopher Goffard, filling in for Julia Wick, and I’m writing from Los Angeles.
Fires continued to rage across Northern California on Monday, with thousands of acres ablaze and some 50,000 people facing possible evacuation.Three deaths were reported in Shasta County in the so-called Zogg fire, which ignited Sunday about nine miles from Redding and had grown swiftly to 15,000 acres by Monday afternoon.
The Shady fire, driven by ferocious Diablo winds, rained embers on Santa Rosa, Sonoma County’s most populous city. Homes burned amid what a fire chief called “explosive fire growth,” and officials told residents in large parts of the city to get out. Buses were filled with evacuees from an assisted-living community, and cars jammed the roads as residents heeded evacuation orders.“This isn’t our first rodeo,”said Santa Rosa Mayor Tom Schwedhelm.
But Sonoma County’s sheriff said some people had to be rescued after refusing to leave, and Gov. Gavin Newsom made a plea: “Please heed local law enforcement... Please listen to them when they raise that alarm bell.” Newsom suggested that “the dynamics of climate change” and “the lack of forest management over the last century” had contributed to the wildfires.
Meanwhile, the Glass fire burned through an area famed for its wineries in Napa Valley, where mandatory evacuations were also in effect. Grouped together, the Shady, Glass and nearby Boysen fires hadburned 11,000 acres and were threatening more than 8,000 structures.
To avoid sparking further wildfires, Pacific Gas & Electric haspreemptively cut powerin multiple California counties.
And the National Weather Service has issued a red flag warning for parts of Southern California, saying that Santa Ana winds and 100-degree temperatures pose an extreme danger of fire. In Santa Clarita, a fire that ignited Monday afternoonengulfed 300 acres within minutes.

Today’sCalifornia memorycomes fromLori Oliwenstein:
It was January of 1994; I’d lived in Los Angeles for just eight months, and was within days of turning 30. I decided it was time to cap off the changes in my life with a haircut ... taking about two feet off my ridiculously long mop of hair. Afterward, I felt like a new person, as silly as that may sound. And that night — well, the following morning — at 4:30 a.m., I was awoken by my first-ever earthquake, the Northridge quake. Something really had shifted ... both within me and without.

"As flames tear through wine country, residents flash back to 2017",https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2020-09-29/fires-evacuation-wine-country-santa-rosa,2020-09-29,"SANTA ROSA —In the hills above Highway 12, Emmilia Carrington hoisted a trash can full of water into her neighbor’s backyard and tipped it over, turning smoldering ash into a rush of steam that curled up over her black rain boots.
Nearby, the 15-year-old’s brother Brody, three years younger, picked up a shovel and dumped dust over live embers, as he’d learned to do in Boy Scouts. Their mother, Eliza, smothered  flames with garden stones.
The family evacuated late Sunday, as flames from the fast-spreading Glass fire licked over a ridge, but had returned Monday morning after Eliza sweet-talked her way past law enforcement.
“Oh my God!” she said Monday afternoon, surveying the hot spots surrounding her home.
It felt like terrible déjà vu.
While ash snowed down across the Sonoma County town of Santa Rosa, the fire — which by Monday evening had burned more than 36,000 acres, prompting tens of thousands of evacuations — was dredging up memories of the deadly Tubbs and Nuns fires that devastated wine country in 2017.
Towering oak trees lining Highway 12 burned from the inside out, oozing orange lava, and a herd of bewildered deer pranced between trees, trying to avoid the flames. Overnight, residents at Oakmont Village, a senior-living community, filed slowly out the front door and loaded onto city buses, which evacuated them beneath a salmon sky.
Along a beloved stretch of vineyards and tasting rooms, the Glass Mountain Inn charred overnight, as did the distinctive stone structure at the famed Chateau Boswell Winery, where flames singed the skins of plump bunches of grapes. At least  eight wineries were damaged, officials said, noting that the fate of a handful of others was still unknown Monday evening.
Some were hesitant to flee. Monday morning, Ben Illia stood in the front yard of the  gray ranch house where he had grown up watering down the landscape with a hose. Nearby, a sprinkler sprayed an arc over the grass.
Behind him, the hills of Trione-Annadel State Park smoldered, disturbing columns of black smoke rising here and there as embers sparked new burns. But Illia was unconcerned. A veteran of the Tubbs fire, he had no plans to leave unless “I see flames coming over the hill,” he said.
Others were more cautious. Rincon Valley resident Randi Cornwall said her family was lucky to live in a small pocket of Santa Rosa that survived the 2017 Tubbs fire,the 2019 Kincade fireand the wildfires last month. But, she said, fear and bad memories remain.
“The Tubbs trauma is real,” Cornwall said. “When you have seen fire move fast before, you know to get the hell out before traffic backs up and fire is licking at your cars.”
During the Tubbs fire, officials delayed warnings out of fear that a mass evacuation would cause panic and clog narrow roads that firefighters needed to access. Evacuation orders only went to a fraction of residents, leaving entire communitiesin the darkabout their danger. Ultimately, 22 people died.
This time, public warnings and orders to leave began within half an hour of the realization that embers had kicked off a new blaze headed toward Santa Rosa. And although the main road on the fireside of town became gridlocked midway through the night, traffic had started flowing again within two hours.
“This isn’t our first rodeo,” Santa Rosa Mayor Tom Schwedhelm said during a news conference, crediting seasoned residents and emergency planners for an unpanicked evacuation.
Even still, officials said, sheriff’s deputies had to rescue some residents who hadn’t evacuated Sunday night, as howling Diablo winds sent flames leaping across Highway 12. Some of the people who were rescued had injuries, officials said, but they declined to offer more details.
California’s fire season struck hard and early this year, in part becauseAugust was the hottest on record statewide.
A freakish lightning storm last month also sparked numerous blazes, although not the Glass fire threatening Santa Rosa and surrounding communities. That fire started Sunday morning near St. Helena.The cause is yet unknown.
On Monday morning on a cul-de-sac not far from the Sonoma County Fairgrounds, which often serves as an evacuation center, Mat Tamba stood in front of his home. This time, however, the flames were too close to shelter at the fairground.
Tamba, who had evacuated the night before but returned for toiletries and a Minnie Mouse stuffed animal for his daughter, watched as a plume floated over the ridge. He flashed back to the Tubbs fire, which burned his in-laws’ home to the ground and thought about the dreaded popping sound he’d heard again last night and instantly recognized as propane tanks exploding in the distance.
“That’s when it becomes eerie,” he said.
All along the sidewalk, neighbors had pulled propane tanks from their  barbecue grills and moved them to the street — a lesson learned from the Tubbs fire.
Around the corner, Marilyn Heller blew away a thick coat of ash blanketing the hood of her Porsche Cayenne. The 72-year-old was packing up a few last things from inside her beloved ranch-style home, which she’s lived in since 1974, when she and her husband purchased it for $39,000.
Trained in the dangers in these hills, she had already packed up everything of sentimental value, including hand-me-downs from her grandmother and aunt, and had filled 40 boxes. After previous fires, Heller said, her son, a former Marine, had bought her a device that she described as a special, heat-resistant straw, which she could use to breathe underwater if she needed to hop into the pool to survive.
For anyone surveying the surrounding hills, the capriciousness of the falling embers was all too evident. They spared many of the million-dollar houses in a neighborhood known as Skyview, but charred a stretch of homes nearby. Midday Monday, firefighters were trying to put out a stubborn blaze at a green-stucco home, already destroyed by flames, and later in the day, as the fire marched on, the entire city of Calistoga was ordered to evacuate.
With many weeks of potentially dangerous fire conditions still ahead — the Tubbs fire started in early October and burned through the entire month — 2020 has already shattered records as a historically devastating fire season in the state. So far this year, flames from 8,100 wildfires, 35 of which arecurrently burning, have charred through more than 3.7 million acres across the state, killing 29 people and burning some 7,000 structures.
In Butte County, the still-burning North Complex fire, which has killed 15 people, destroyed much of thetown of Berry Creekand burned 306,000 acres, prompted evacuation warnings on Monday in the town of Paradise, which was destroyed inthe Camp firein 2018.
In Shasta County, thenewly ignited Zogg fireclaimed more California lives on Monday, killing  three people and prompting massive evacuations as it tore through hundreds of acres in less than an hour. By Monday night, that had brought this statewide death toll for this fire season to 29 people.
Late in the day, the Zogg fire had grown to 15,000 acres. In the foothillsabove Santa Clarita, a quick-moving brush fire started Monday afternoon, burning 200 acres within minutes.
Back in Santa Rosa on Monday afternoon, Jeff Sengstack stood outside his home on a hill just outside the evacuation advisory zone.
For now, the fire was still four miles away.
But he knew how devastatingly fast flames could travel here. Three years ago, Sengstack and his wife, Birgit,fled their homein the middle of the night as ruby embers rained down. Two minutes after they pulled out of the driveway, the home they had lived in for 18 years was engulfed in flames.
It took them three years to rebuild and they finally returned home in July. So on Sunday, as Sengstack watched from his porch as flames shot hundreds of feet into the night sky, he felt deeply stressed. His head pulsed.
“Chest-tightening,” said Sengstack, 71, who choked back tears.
The wind had thundered around 1 a.m. Monday, but eventually calmed and Sengstack managed to get a bit of sleep. If they ultimately need to evacuate, they’ll head to a friend’s home in Belvedere. They won’t take much with them, he said, as they lost almost everything of value in the fire three years ago.
Sengstack hoped that the winds would stay calm and he and his wife could stay put in their new home — his simple modern farmhouse, he calls it.

"Letters to the Editor: Homes burn because of embers, not trees. Fire policy ignores that",https://www.latimes.com/opinion/story/2020-09-29/homes-burn-because-of-embers-not-trees-fire-policy-ignores-that,2020-09-29,"To the editor:Thanks to the Los Angeles Times Editorial Board for providing a needed voice of reason in response to the wildfire crisis. The Times addressed what the state of California has continually refused to do about the actual reason whyso many lives and homes are lost during wildfires.
Every devastating wildfire in California has been driven by wind and drought, now made worse by climate change. As the winds blow, embers can fly miles ahead of the fire front. It’s these embers that ignite most homes.
The condition of forests, often far from burning communities, has next to nothing to do with it.
Agencies like CalFire and the U.S. Forest Service should look at the devastation and acknowledge that the habitat clearance approach they continue to advocate has failed to protect our communities. Instead, we must focus on making neighborhoods and towns themselves fire-safe and ember-resistant, regardless of what the entrenched interests advocate.
Richard Halsey, Escondido
The writer is director of the California Chaparral Institute.
..
To the editor:Thank you for supporting house hardening and wildfire science that helps nature. We also need to focus on discouraging construction in areas prone to wildfires.
I live in Big Rock in Malibu, and we are constantly under the threat of wildfire when Santa Ana winds blow through our fire corridors. Still, the city continuously allows large additions and builds in our community despite the wildfire and landslide threat.
We need the state to ban development in these zones. Most of us in California live on the edge of disaster, and we need our government officials to look out for us and not encourage further development.

City of Ventura moves forward with polystyrene regulation,https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2020-10-30/city-of-ventura-moves-forward-with-polystyrene-regulation,2020-10-30,"The city of Ventura is proceeding with plans to regulate the use of polystyrene from local restaurants and businesses.
The ordinance was introduced during a Ventura City Council meeting last week, following a6-0 vote in Februaryto begin drafting its language.
The polystyrene material is commonly used for single-use plates, cups, takeout food containers and packing materials, and is harmful to the environment, officials said.
“Expanded polystyrene litter is one of the most prevalent and hard-to-remove items found on our beaches due to its weight and fragility,” City Manager Alex McIntyre and Public Works Director Phillip Nelson wrote in a report for the council. It does not biodegrade, and it cannot be recycled, they said.
If adopted, the proposed ordinance would ban the use of polystyrene containers at restaurants, grocery stores, convenience stores and other businesses.
Speaking at the council meeting, city of Ventura environmental sustainability manager Joe Yahner said what makes polystyrene different from other material is that it quickly breaks into small pieces, which makes it very challenging to remove from the environment. Banning  polystyrene will help mitigate local litter issues and reduce debris in the marine environment, he said.
Several Ventura residents spoke during the public comment portion of the meeting, and all were in favor of a ban on the material.
Polystyrene is “incredibly harmful for the city of Ventura,” said one resident, Madeline Cook, adding that the Environmental Protection Agency and the International Agency for Research on Cancer warn that the material could be carcinogenic.
“It’s affecting not only our landscape, but members of our community,” she said.
Another resident said she was “shocked” to learn the material hadn’t already been banned. If the ordinance is adopted, Ventura will join more than 130 cities in California that have implemented similar regulations, including Ojai, Santa Barbara, Manhattan Beach, Santa Monica and Hermosa Beach.
The ordinance is expected to be approved at the next City Council meeting Nov. 9, said Ventura spokeswoman Heather Sumagaysay.
But it will not go into effect until summer 2021, in part to account for the hardships many businesses are facing because of the COVID-19 pandemic — such as restaurants  that are relying heavily on delivery and takeout options.
“We didn’t want to make any type of movements that would impact or potentially hurt business who are already hurting,” Sumagaysay said, adding that the city will offer an extension to businesses that need more time to make the  change.
Deputy Public Works Director Mary Joyce Ivers said Friday that the city will also implement an outreach program to provide businesses with the tools they need to make the transition. Several businesses have already stopped using the material voluntarily, she said. The city surveyed more than 200 restaurants and worked with the Ventura Chamber of Commerce in preparation for the ordinance.
There are other exemptions, too. Yahner said polystyrene packaging prepared outside the city then sold within the city, such as egg cartons, won’t be subject to the ban.
The ordinance also does not go so far as to mandate that packaging materials be made of compostable, recyclable and biodegradable material, although Yahner said it could be amended to include that language at a later time.

Landmark Carlsbad smokestack coming down,https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2020-10-30/landmark-carlsbad-smokestack-coming-down,2020-10-30,"Anyone who’s driven past the Encina Power Station, a coastal Carlsbad landmark since the 1950s, can’t miss the changes in recent weeks.
Demolition of the old power plant is finally underway. Scaffolding lines the seaward side of the boxy concrete building, and there’s more at the top of its distinctive 400-foot-tall smokestack.
“Preparation for the Encina stack removal is ongoing and will wrap up by the end of 2020,” Chris Rimel, communications manager for plant owner NRG, said Thursday.
“The stack will come down in the first and second quarter of 2021,” he said. “A mechanical breaker mounted on the top of the stack will break the concrete in a top-down circular pattern, dropping the broken concrete down the center of the stack until about 60 feet of the stack remains. The rest of the stack will be removed by excavator equipment.”
To some people, the smokestack is an eyesore, while to others it is a welcome sign. Sailors at sea and aviators approaching McClellan-Palomar Airport in Carlsbad use the tall concrete column for navigation. Many a weary driver on the 5 Freeway sees it and knows that home is near.
Carlsbad resident Jim Strickland led anunsuccessful effort to preserve the chimney, if not the rest of the power plant, as part of a park or community building. He presented his ideas to the city’s Arts Commission, Historical Preservation Commission and the City Council, but to no avail.
“I thought it was a simple, obvious, sure thing for it to be designated as a historic landmark, but it wasn’t,” Strickland said.
NRG officials said there was no chance of preserving the stack. A contract signed in 2014 with San Diego Gas & Electric Co. and the city of Carlsbad requires the utility company to remove the entire plant, including the smokestack.
Initially one of the tallest structures on the West Coast, the smokestack was built in the 1970s to replace four shorter stacks as part of a $110-million upgrade of thepower plant. Six workers died when a 190-foot crane collapsed during the construction.
NRG Energy officially retired the plant Dec. 11, 2018, after the company built a more efficient plant nearby on the same property.
Fueled by natural gas, the new plant can go from zero to its full power of 500 megawatts in just 10 minutes compared to the hours required for the old plant. The quick response can help meet the widespread need for air conditioning on a hot summer afternoon or the sudden demand in a natural disaster such as an earthquake or wildfire that takes down transmission lines.
Also, the new plant is air-cooled, so it doesn’t need the once-through seawater cooling system used by the old plant.
In November 2019, the city approved a nine-month extension for the demolition project so that the plant’s seawater intakes could continue to be used temporarily by the desalination plant that also operates on the property. Poseidon Water, which operates the desalination plant, installed its own intake pumps earlier this year.
Now the demolition is back on track and about 25% complete, Rimel said.
The process includes the removal of the exterior panels on the power block building, all exterior structures and equipment, and the generation equipment from inside the building, including some materials containing the hazardous material asbestos.
Asbestos is a naturally occurring mineral that was widely used for insulation in the 1950s. Years later, it was banned after doctors learned the airborne fibers were easily inhaled and can cause cancer and other diseases.
Any asbestos found at the plant will be packed in containers and shipped off for disposal under mandated guidelines, a process called abatement, before other work can begin.
California
The historic powerhouse, a beachfront building that housed generators that supplied electricity to the old Del Mar Hotel and part of the town in the 1920s, is structurally sound but the towering smokestack beside it is in sorry shape, an engineer has told city officials.
“Demolition wastes are managed as recyclable and non-recyclable materials,” Rimel said. “An estimated 34,000 tons of scrap metal will be recycled at a scrap metal facility, and 50,000 tons of concrete will be used onsite.”
Most of the crushed concrete will be used as fill to restore the site to its original grade before the plant was built.
“Batteries, used oils, and other wastes will be recycled when possible at approved facilities,” Rimel said. “Approximately 2,700 tons of abated asbestos and 1,500 tons of non-recyclable materials will be disposed of at approved landfills.”
The project’s contractor, Brandenburg Corp., Inc., is a 50-year-old Midwest-based company that specializes in demolition and environmental remediation.
About 200 people are working at the site, including NRG personnel, most of whom are from San Diego County and the surrounding counties. Because of the ongoing pandemic, the company follows COVID-19 protocols consistent with guidelines from the Centers for Disease Control.
“Personnel are temperature screened and respond to a health-check questionnaire before accessing the site each day,” Rimel said. “Personal protective equipment including masks are required.”
Demolition will completely remove the old building, smokestack and supporting structures and equipment, he said. The new SDG&E plant, the Carlsbad Desalination Plant and the Carlsbad Aquafarm all will remain on the site, most of which is owned by NRG. The Hubbs-SeaWorld fish hatchery that operates on SDG&E property on the north side of the lagoon also will stay.
What’s next is uncertain for the valuable piece of coastal real estate, which is designated as “visitor serving commercial and open space” in the city’s General Plan. A hotel, restaurants and a shopping center could be built under the existing zoning, but a decision is years away.
The site’s redevelopment depends on many factors including public participation, market conditions and the entitlement process, Rimel said.

Irvine fire was a recipe for disaster. It became a rare victory for firefighters in grim year,https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2020-10-30/luck-was-on-the-side-of-orange-county-in-recent-fires,2020-10-30,"The conditions seemed ripe for disaster.
Gusting Santa Ana winds had grounded water-dumping aircraft for hours, and flames were spreading across a tinder-dry fuel bed. Downwind sat a tangled maze of suburban streets where more than 80,000 people were ordered to evacuate.
Had this week’s Silverado fire began anywhere else, and at any other time, firefighters said it could have been the latest disaster in California’s busiest fire year on record — a time when firefighting resources have been stretched perilously thin.
But this latest fire started on the outskirts of master-planned Orange County, where the roads are smooth and wide, communities were built under the state’s most recent fire code and the largest regional firefighting force in the world was at the ready and just a phone call away.
Despite 45-mph gusts launching embers into the suburban sprawl, where cars sat bumper to bumper trying to flee the oncoming flames, not a single home was lost or seriously damaged. In the end, thanks to a semi-formal agreement among the region’s biggest fire departments and the first-ever use of the world’s biggest, fastest water-dropping helicopter at night, crews were able to stand their ground, keeping the flames largely north of Portola Parkway, a major road that divides the subdivisions of Irvine from the backcountry.
“In some ways, we got a little bit lucky,” said Orange County Fire Chief Brian Fennessy.
In a year when firefighters have lost so many battles — in part because the number of blazes has stretched firefighting resources — this firefight and a second battle that began hours later in Yorba Linda could be considered successes, officials said.
When the Silverado fire began, about a third of Orange County’s firefighters were in their last hour of a two-day shift and were about to be replaced, in essence, putting twice as many firefighters at the ready than would typically be available, Fennessy said. As the chief headed to department headquarters down Portola Parkway that morning, he managed to come across the fire the moment it jumped the road and moved toward the subdivisions, giving commanders on-the-ground intel of where the fire was and how it was behaving.
“I just got off the phone with the [operations] chief, he’s telling me the fire is still high up on the hill and right in front of me the fire is coming up the road,” Fennessy said. “Like so many of these fires, they show up so much faster than people think.”
Fennessy pulled into the neighborhood and, along with one Irvine police officer, began urging residents to flee, he said. At one point the chief jumped out of his vehicle, grabbed a nearby fire extinguisher and put out a spot fire burning next to a home, video on his cellphone shows.
As authorities cleared out the neighborhoods, a surge of crews were headed into the area thanks to a pact reached among Orange, Los Angeles and Ventura counties and the city of Los Angeles. Fire chiefs in those districts had all agreed to help one another in dire situations, avoiding the state’s usual mutual aid system because it’s viewed as being slow to dispatch resources.
Fennessy reached out to his peers and within an hour of the call, had 25 engines racing to help. More crews flowed into the county in the following days. More than 2,200 firefighters arrived overall.
Had either of these fires erupted in August or September, when firefighters and equipment were busy battling record wildfires in the central and northern parts of the state, there’s no telling what could have happened, Fennessy said. When the Blue Ridge fire broke out in the afternoon in Yorba Linda, commanders were able to quickly divert firefighters to the new threat. Only one home was destroyed, while seven others were damaged.
“All of us were stunned that there were only two fires,” Fennessy said. “We dodged a bullet in Orange County.”
Battling a wind-driven fire on the ground, and head-on, is a dangerous proposition, so hotshot crews worked the rear and sides of the fire to limit its spread while other firefighters took up positions in neighborhoods to protect homes from an  onslaught of firebrands. Two hotshot crew members were critically burned in that initial attack on the fire’s flank and remain hospitalized.
Though aircraft were grounded for several hours in the morning, winds died down by the afternoon, according to National Weather Service data, and the aerial assault on the fires went into full swing. Air tankers caked the grass and shrub-covered hillsides with pink retardant while helicopters doused flare-ups with water — even at night.
“Southern California is an oddity in the world, you guys have a true air force down there,” said Mel Ceccanti, a pilot and director of flight operations for Coulson Aviation, a firefighting aviation company that holds contracts around the world and has crews stationed in Orange County for a three-month period this year.
Throughout the first night of the Silverado fire, Ceccanti operated the company’s retrofitted CH-47 Chinook, a beast of a helicopter used by the Army that can fly 200 mph and drop 3,000 gallons of water or retardant at once — a payload on par with some fixed-wing tankers.
With night skies relatively clear and plenty of lakes and reservoirs in the area, Ceccanti was able to drop 47,000 gallons of water over four hours.
“It’s safe to say we dropped more water in Orange County than Orange County has ever had dropped,” Ceccanti said.
Though the fire burned through bone-dry vegetation, Orange County’s landscape is markedly different from the terrain in Northern California — a key advantage to firefighters.
There’s no timber-heavy forest to sustain fire for long periods of time, so while the light grass and shrubs can burn extremely hot and launch embers into the air, the fires go out just as fast as they begin, Fennessy said.
“It burns so frickin’ quick, the ember cast can only last for so long,” he said.
In retrospect, both Fennessy, who battled the 2007 firestorm in San Diego, and Ceccanti, who most recently flew over Australia’s massive bushfires, say the county caught a break this week. Had the fire reached Trabuco Canyon, it could have raged out of control as winds pushed it deeper into rugged terrain. Had the winds remained as strong as they were initially, aircraft wouldn’t have been able to help.
“We support ground firefighters, no matter how much you put on that fire, someone has to come through with a hose to put that fire out,” Ceccanti said. “If you bet the farm on aviation alone, you might catch yourself with your pants around your ankles.”
As of Thursday, the Silverado fire had burned 13,390 acres and was  51% contained, and the Blue Ridge fire had burned 14,334 acres and was  39% contained. Most evacuations in the county were lifted in the afternoon.

Possible human remains found in fire pit on San Diego’s Fiesta Island,https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2020-10-29/possible-human-remains-found-in-fire-pit-on-fiesta-island,2020-10-30,"A homicide investigation was underway on Fiesta Island after human remains were found in a fire pit.
SAN DIEGO —A homicide investigation was underway Thursday on Fiesta Island after a man picking up trash found what appeared to be human remains in a fire pit, a San Diego police official said.
The man made the discovery on the east end of the peninsular park shortly after 10:30 a.m. and flagged down lifeguards, who called police. Officers sent a picture of the find to a forensic anthropologist, who confirmed that they looked like human remains, police Lt. Matt Dobbs said.
He declined to provide further details about what was found.
“I’m not going to disclose at this time just to protect the integrity of the investigation just in case they are human remains and that becomes an integral part of the investigation,” he told reporters at the scene.
According to local TV news reports, the remains included what looked like a skull and teeth.
Dobbs said the San Diego County medical examiner’s office will examine the remains to determine whether they are human. He said he didn’t know how long that will take.
The lieutenant said it’s not uncommon for police to respond to reports of human remains.
“Typically they’re not” human, he said. “They’re animal remains or something like that. To find actual human remains is not very common.”

Today at approx 10:30 AM, our department was notified about the discovery of possible human remains on Fiesta Island.Our Homicide Unit is on scene and evaluating.The area will remain closed to the public for at least several hours.pic.twitter.com/8oFVaFxTe4

"Firefighter appears to have been ‘burned over’ by El Dorado fire, Forest Service says",https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2020-10-29/california-fires-el-dorado-firefighter-death,2020-10-29,"More information has been revealed about the death of Charles Morton, the Big Bear hotshot firefighter whodied battling the El Doradofire in San Bernardino County.
Morton, 39, died Sept. 17 while conducting fire suppression efforts, according to an incident report filed by the U.S. Forest Service.
“It appears he was burned over by the fire and passed away,” the report said.
The San Bernardino County coroner’s office confirmed that the burns were Morton’s official cause of death.
Morton was a squad boss on the interagency hotshot crew, which is composed of highly skilled and specially trained firefighters who are assigned to work the most challenging and remote portions of fires.
More than 1,000 people watched Morton’s livestreamed funeral service in September, during which the 14-year Forest Service veteran wasrememberedas hardworking, funny and devoted.
“He chose to protect his mountain. He chose to protect his crew. He chose to protect his community. He chose to protect all of us here today,” Morton’s fiancee, Monica Tapia, said during the service.
California
The 7,000-acre El Dorado fire was sparked by smoke devices used during a gender-reveal party at a Yucaipa, Calif., park.
The El Dorado fire was sparked Sept. 5 by a pyrotechnic device from a gender-reveal party at a park in Yucaipa. It burned through more than 22,700 acres and is still not 100% contained, according to the Forest Service.
The incident report about Morton’s death, first reported by the Orange County Register, is preliminary, said Zach Behrens, a spokesman for the Forest Service in San Bernardino. It could take a year or more for the final report to be released.
This year’s wildfires have proved deadly for firefighters and civilians alike. More than 30 people have been killed by blazes across the state in 2020, including three firefighters.
Five firefighters were injured this week battling the Silverado fire in Orange County, said Michelle Steel, chairwoman of the Orange County Board of Supervisors. Three were treated for minor injuries, andtwo remain in critical conditionat the Orange County Global Medical Center in Santa Ana.
A member of Morton’s hotshot crew team, Carlos Baltazar, 35, was also reported missing a week after Morton’s death. He has still not been found, Behrens said.
Baltazar was off duty at the time of his disappearance, and his backpack was found 75 yards from his abandoned vehicle. His family said he was distressed over Morton’s death.
Officials are asking anyone with information about Baltazar to contact the San Bernardino Sheriff’s Department at (760) 956-5001.

Santa Ana winds bring ‘critical situation for fire weather’,https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2020-11-30/santa-ana-winds-fire-warning-weather,2020-11-30,"A combination of bone-dry conditions and gusty Santa Ana winds are raising new concerns of elevated fire risk in Southern California this week.
Winds of up to 65 mph in the mountains of Los Angeles and Ventura counties are expected by the end of the week. Those gusts, coupled with single-digit humidity and little chance of precipitation, could create dangerous fire conditions, said David Sweet, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service in Oxnard.
“We’re looking at a likely critical situation for fire weather,” Sweet said.
The National Weather Service in Los Angeles warned in a tweet Sunday that “any spark could ... blow up into a large, destructive wildfire” and urged residents living in high-risk zones to prepare.
Vegetation is about as dry as it gets here in#SoCal- with#SantaAnaWindson the way, any fire spark could grow blow up into a large, destructive#wildfire. Are you READY?@CAL_FIRE's Ready, Set, GO program can help!#CAwx#CAfirepic.twitter.com/4PSrZ0Qrrk
More than 8,000 Southern California Edison customers had theirpower turned off on Thanksgiving eveningas high winds led to elevated wildfire risklast week.
Peak Santa Ana wind season runs from November through January, so this latest wind event isn’t unusual. But rainfall is far below normal, adding to fire worries, officials warn.
Earlier this month,a pair of fires sparked by similar conditionsraged along the California-Nevada border.
The Mountain View fire killed one woman and decimated the small Eastern Sierra town of Walker. About 88 miles north, the Pinehaven fire ignited the same day and damaged scores of homes in Reno.
California
Warmer, drier conditions are predicted for portions of the U.S. currently enduring drought.
“That’s why this is a difficult time of year,” Sweet said. “It’s really a race to see whether the rains come in first, or whether the Santa Ana winds come in first. And when the winds come in before the rainfall comes, you have that high fire danger.”
The winds appear to be winning.
Beginning Monday night, winds from the north are predicted to pour over Santa Barbara County, spurred by high pressure in Nevada and lower pressure on the Southern California coast, Sweet said. By Tuesday night, those winds will likely shift to the northeast, and by Wednesday, the Santa Anas are slated to arrive, increasing over the afternoon and peaking on Thursday or Friday.
“We’re expecting a moderate to strong event,” and red flag warnings could go up as the winds pick up, Sweet said.
Valley regions, including the San Gabriel and San Fernando areas, could see gusts up to 60 mph, while coastal regions are expected to experience winds up to 45 mph, Sweet said. The Hollywood Hills and surrounding areas could get winds as high as 40 mph, he added.
Meanwhile, there’s no rain in sight for the next seven days, forecasters say.
Typically, downtown Los Angeles records 1.65 inches of rain between Oct. 1 — the start of the water year — and the beginning of December. This year, however, the area has seen only 0.11 of an inch, Sweet said.

"Before disasters hit California, these workers get the word out in many languages",https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2020-11-28/listos-california-nonprofits-help-latinos-prepare-for-disasters,2020-11-28,"The night the deadly Tubbs fire broke out in 2017, Alma Bowen, then an emergency services dispatcher for Sonoma County, experienced a life-changing moment.
For 20 hours, she answered 911 calls, many from Latinos who spoke Spanish and didn’t understand or were confused by the emergency alerts they were receiving in English.
The Tubbs fire destroyed or damaged at least 5,500 structures and killed at least 22 people in the mountainous area north of Santa Rosa, authorities said.
The experience persuaded Bowen to leave her job and start anonprofitto offer Spanish-language CPR training, 911 awareness classes, and disaster recovery and preparedness workshops.
Last year, her organization and dozens of other nonprofits received grant money from the state as part of a $50-million outreach program calledListos California.The mission: prepare Latinos and other vulnerable groups for major disasters.
“We know that people who are socially isolated or live in poverty, have language barriers, or other access or functional needs challenges need to be the top priority for preparedness campaigns,” said Karen Baker, architect and co-chair of Listos California.
This year, a slower but deadlier disaster demanded the groups’ attention: the spread of the novel coronavirus, which has disproportionately infected and killed Latinos across the state. The state has reported more than 1.8 million confirmed cases of the virus and more than 19,000 related deaths.
“You had to shift from what might happen to what was happening,” Baker said. “What was happening was that people were dying of this thing called COVID … and when you looked at the data and saw diverse communities getting hit even harder than less diverse ones — it was more of a call to action.”
Listos California expanded its campaign in July to boost prevention efforts in areas hit hard by the pandemic, such as the predominantly Latino Imperial County, where 11 Lotería-themed billboard ads were placed in the county to help slow the spread of the virus.
The billboards included pink, blue and green Lotería cards — designed by a local artist to draw attention —  with safety messages in Spanglish. The colorful ads were one of many targeting bilingual communities in the state. The campaign also put out safety and informative guides in Spanish, Chinese, Korean, Tagalog and other languages.
Statewide, Listos California says it has reached 1.6 million people.

California is famously prone to disasters such as earthquakes and floods, but it was wildfires that were instrumental in highlighting the need to boost disaster preparedness that was tailored around the needs of vulnerable groups such as the poor, elderly and people with disabilities.
But there was a considerable amount of focus on the state’s largest ethnic group — Latinos. Leaders even named the statewide campaign in Spanish.
Major disasters often hit Latinos hardest because they tend to be at an economic disadvantage and live in communities that are underfunded, officials said. Latinos also hold a large percentage of essential jobs in the state, including  manufacturing and agriculture positions.
Historically, public warning systems have long been structured with little input from the Latino population, which includes immigrants, migrant workers and Indigenous groups. Language barriers meant exclusion from vital information or emergency service response.
When the devastating Thomas fire raced through Ventura County in 2017, many residents were able to evacuate first while Spanish-speaking immigrants were left in limbo to figure out what to do or relied on their children for translation of emergency alerts, officials said. After complaints from nonprofit organizations, Ventura County began to send out information in Spanish. By then, the fire had been burning for 10 days,according to a state audit.
The pandemic brought its ownchallenges.It has taken adevastating toll on Latino residents,who make up 39% of the state’s population but account for 59% ofcoronavirus infectionsand 49% of related deaths.
Baker said nonprofits and community-based organizations were given the flexibility to spend 20% of the grant money to help with COVID-19 prevention efforts in their regions. But because many couldn’t have gatherings, organizations had to come up with creative ways to reach people, such as hosting videoconferences.
Bowen said her organization, Nuestra Comunidad, did that but also held outdoor workshops for migrant workers at vineyards and agricultural fields. She handed out masks and disaster preparedness guidebooks. She also attended food giveaways to reach more residents in Sonoma County.
Listos California recently launched a new initiative with the United Way of Fresno and Madera Counties, which partnered with theBinational Center for the Development of Oaxacan Indigenous CommunitiesandMixteco Indígena Community Organizing Projectto create audio files with information on COVID-19 and emergency preparedness for those who speak Mixteco and other Indigenous languages from Mexico. Many are not fluent in Spanish. They also made similar audio files in Punjabi, Hmong and Spanish.
In the midst of active wildfires and a global pandemic,@ListosCAhas collaborated with several state agencies and community-based organizations to produce our new ""Farmworkers Initiative"" with resources for farmworkers on#COVID19& disaster preparedness.https://t.co/5r8QMo6lKRpic.twitter.com/JPwJz0r61O
Before launchingNuestra Comunidad,Bowen often questioned why Sonoma County wasn’t engaging the more than 130,000 Latinos who lived and worked in the region about 911 emergency services.
Bowen said as a dispatcher she saw how immigrants and migrant workers hesitated to make emergency calls. The problem was twofold: They didn’t always know exactly what kind of an event they should dial 911 for, and they often came from homelands where there was little trust in government. Some who were in the country illegally also worried about their possible deportation.
When the Tubbs fire broke out, Bowen found herself having to inform Latino residents about calling 211 for information — not 911. They could receive help, and it wouldn’t be used against them, she told immigrants.
One such call that stuck with her involved two migrant workers who didn’t know the address of the vineyard where they lived and worked. Neither could read English. Bowen said she spent several minutes figuring out their location based on letters they could recognize. When she finally did, it was too late. The men had to flee.
“It was the first time I couldn’t send help,” she said. “There was not a damn thing I could do about it.”
Bowen said the Listos California grants have helped her organizations boost their community outreach efforts. She hopes funding for the campaign will continue.
In the small rural town of Ukiah, several residents got together to form Ukiah Vecinos en Acción (Ukiah Neighbors in Action, or UVA). The coalition was formed in reaction to the anti-immigrant sentiment that helped lead to Donald Trump’s election in 2016. What started out as an effort to alleviate immigrant concerns expanded to provide Spanish-language information on COVID-19 and wildfires.
Jackeline Orozco, a member of the coalition, which has received grant money from Listos California, said that for years government agencies in the city and county had failed to put out information in Spanish whenever disasters struck the region.
“We’re also part of this economy; we’re part of the workforce,” Orozco said. “It’s also our right to receive information in our own language too.”
In July, spurred by the fires and COVID-19, the groupsent a letter to the Mendocino County Board of Supervisorsurging it to start sending out vital alerts in Spanish. The group also urged the county to hire certified translators and hold news conferences in English and Spanish. The letter was signed and supported by other grass-roots organizations in the area.
The statewide campaign to improve disaster preparedness among Latinos and other groups appears to be having an effect.
Last year, Omaira Baptista woke up to a mandatory evacuation alert from Napa County. Her home was in the path of the Kincade fire. Baptista, who arrived in the country from Venezuela two years before, didn’t understand English. It wasn’t until a friend called that she realized she had to evacuate. She said she grabbed whatever she could.
“It was a traumatic experience,” she said.
But early this year, while Baptista was working at the UpValley Family Center, the Listos California campaign caught her attention. She signed up for a disaster planning workshop and registered for Nixle alerts in Spanish. She learned about emergency services and how best to keep her family safe during evacuations.
About two months ago, Baptista got another alert in the early hours. The Glass fire was ravaging wine country, and she needed to evacuate. This time, she didn’t panic.
“I grabbed my documents, clothes, medicine, and filled the luggage,” she said. “I had my car facing toward our escape route.”
When the mandatory evacuations came through, she grabbed her keys and fled with her family to Lodi as she had done last year, when she was less prepared and their escape felt like a mad dash.
“It wasn’t as stressful as the last time,” Baptista said. “It was such a big difference.”

"Nearly 100,000 Edison customers may lose power amid fire risk",https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2020-11-27/edison-outage-against-wildfires,2020-11-27,"Nearly 100,000 Southern California Edison customers across six counties could see their power shut off Friday as part of a larger effort by the utility to reduce the risk of wildfires during windy conditions, officials said.
As of Friday morning, 13,357 customers were experiencing power outages in the utilities’ service area, according to Edison spokeswoman Taelor Bakewell. Affected households are in Los Angeles, Orange, Kern, San Bernardino and Ventura counties. More people in these five areas, along with Riverside County, could still lose power, depending on the ferocity and direction of the Santa Ana winds.
“We know how disruptive it can be, and this is a tough weekend to go through it — even my grandparents can be affected — but we live in Southern California and we can face so many natural disasters,” Bakewell said. “We’re just trying to mitigate as many risks as we can, and we appreciate everyone’s patience as we work to protect the community.”
As howling gales continue to whip through the region, officials at the National Weather Service are predicting a mostly sunny day after Thanksgiving, with northeast winds of up to 45 miles per hour from Malibu to the Hollywood Hills.
A wind advisory will remain in effect until 3 p.m. and a red-flag warning for extreme fire danger has been extended until 6 p.m. Saturday for the mountains in Los Angeles and Ventura counties and the Santa Clarita Valley. Highs will be in the mid-60s to mid-70s throughout the region, while air quality is in the good to moderate range.
Kristen Stewart, a meteorologist for the National Weather Service, said California is in for a dry winter “as well as most of the West coast, really.
“We’re in a La Nina pattern, it will be warmer than normal, and after the long drought we’ve had, we really need rain, but we’re not going to get it. “
Edison customers can sign up for text alerts about power outages at (800) 655-4555 or go towww.sce.com/pspsand type in your address to check your status.
“I know it’s nice to light candles around the holidays,” Bakewell said, “but we’re encouraging people to use flashlights for safety.”

"Garcetti urges L.A. residents to stay home on New Year’s Eve, LAPD vows to crack down on gatherings",https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2020-12-31/new-years-eve-2020-garcetti-warns-la-to-stay-home,2020-12-31,"Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti is pleading with revelers to stay home on New Year’s Eve and said he plans to crack down on “super-spreader” events in the city.
In a somber briefing Wednesday — his 83rd and final COVID-19 briefing of the year — a beleaguered Garcetti described 2020 as “the toughest year of our city’s history” and said, despite the holiday, “it’s almost too painful to look backward.”
“Nobody should be gathering in a big party, and nobody should be gathering in a small party, as well,” he said, noting that the latest coronavirus surge has beentied to Thanksgivinggatherings. “These are the ways this virus will spread to your loved ones, to those closest to you.”
The announcement came as Los Angeles Countymarked its 10,000th deathfrom COVID-19 and broke a single-day record for deaths for the second day in a row, notching 262 fatalities on Wednesday after recording 242 on Tuesday.
California
Officials are not sure how bad the post-Christmas coronavirus surge will be, but many experts say January is looking to be a ‘grim month.’
The current surge has crippled the region’s healthcare system, and, with virus transmissions linked toChristmas gatheringsyet to manifest, public health officials say the worst is yet to come.
“We won’t know it for a while, but we will feel it in our homes, in our ICU units and in our morgues,” Garcetti said. “Please do not let us have a third surge that we simply cannot take here in Los Angeles as a result of our New Year.”
With infections and hospitalizations surging in L.A., please join me live for the latest COVID-19 updates and learn what you can do to ring in the New Year safely.https://t.co/0Gr4JMpoH5
The mayor said the Los Angeles Police Department will deploy significant patrolling Thursday to enforce the public health rules that prohibit large gatherings or“super-spreader” events.
“We will be out there in force on New Year’s Eve,” he said.
Earlier this week, the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power disconnected utilities for a “chronic party house” in the Hollywood Hills, Garcetti said, and City Atty. Mike Feuer has asked the event website Eventbrite to take down invitations to parties on New Year’s Eve.
Still, events are popping up on other websites, including a “Winter Paradise” rave planned for downtown Los Angeles. Tickets for the event are $80 apiece through a site called Ticketleap.
The soiree, which is being heavily promoted by the Why Not Party group on Instagram, is touted as a “fully immersive escapade” that will run from 9 p.m. to 6 a.m.
“Please disregard the generic email Eventbrite sent,” the group wrote Thursday on Instagram. “The event is NOT CANCELLED.”
Event organizers did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
Earlier this week, Beverly Hills restaurant La Scala came under fire for promoting a “speakeasy”-style indoor dining event on New Year’s Eve — a move itlater walked back.
Another restaurant, Westlake’s 101 North Eatery & Bar, is advertising a $195 New Year’s Eve tapas package for two, which it says customers can pick up and eat on their outdoor patio.
The restaurant’s publicist, Rachel Lucosky, said the event was not a violation of the county’s outdoor dining ban because no service will be provided. She noted that diners are simply invited to pick up their meal and picnic on outdoor tables adjacent to the restaurant.
“The owners would love it if everybody stayed home and picked up their food, but everybody needs a place of refuge to get some fresh air, so it’s more so promoting that,” she said.
On Wednesday night, police were on hand to “keep the peace” at aChristian singer’s gatheringon skid row that was deemed a potential super-spreader event. Officer Drake Madison of the LAPD said Thursday that no arrests were made at the event.
Madison said New Year’s Eve should keep the department busy.
“It’s one of those nights we just need to make it through,” he said.
The Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department has also targeted “the underground party scene,” announcing Wednesday that it hadmade 235arrests at super-spreader events throughout December.
“I have made it clear that we will seek out and take law enforcement action against all super-spreader events occurring anywhere within Los Angeles County,” Sheriff Alex Villanueva said in a statement. “The goal of these enforcement actions is to reduce the spread of COVID-19 and the risk to our vulnerable populations.”
In Los Angeles County, 1 in 5 are now testing positive for COVID-19, Garcetti said Wednesday — the same day that7,546 people were hospitalized, the highest number since the start of the pandemic.
“My message couldn’t be clearer,” the mayor said. “Do not get together with others on New Year’s Eve. Do not host or attend a party in person. Do not travel. Celebrate virtually, stay home and welcome the New Year with people in your household and no one else.”

"Citing climate change, LADWP ends free water deal for Long Valley ranchers and sparks anger among conservationists",https://www.latimes.com/environment/story/2021-01-30/ladwp-ends-free-water-for-long-valley-ranchers-due-to-climate-change-but-imperils-sage-grouse-habitat-critics-say,2021-01-30,"MAMMOTH LAKES —Since the early 1920s, the Long Valley plains east of Yosemite have inspired comparison to a rustic Western paradise — an idyllic frontier where sparkling creeks meander through lush pastures, waters teem with feisty trout and sage grouse make ostentatious displays of romance.
Much of this great, green expansiveness, however, owes to the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power, which aggressively purchased land and water rights here more than a century ago. The department’s routine annual deliveries of free surplus water to its tenants have helped sustain ranching operations and habitat for many decades.
For the record:
5:53 p.m. Jan. 30, 2021A previous version of this article misspelled the last name of Alameda County Superior Court Judge Evelio Grillo as Grilla.
But that relationship is now at risk of ending, and could carry dire consequences for one of California’s most striking and violently formed landscapes.
Citing the impacts of climate change and decreased snowpack — as well as the demands of 4 million ratepayers about 300 miles to the south — the DWP has told ranchers they should no longer expect free water for irrigation uses. The planned water cutbacks, which were first announced in 2018, would affect some 6,400 acres of land nearCrowley Lake— an area that was shaped by an immense volcanic eruption 760,000 years ago.
The move to end water giveaways has not only angered ranchers, but it has also stunned local officials and environmentalists, who say dewatered pastures will increase the risk of wildfire and reduce sage grouse habitat, among other things.
In a joint lawsuit filed by Mono County and the Sierra Club, plaintiffs charge that the DWP failed to properly consider the environmental consequences of its decision.
For seven decades, the DWP has provided several lessees in the area about 5 acre-feet of water per acre, per year, which made their pastures nutritious through summer and added luster to the area’s biking, hiking and angling hot spots. (An acre-foot of water equals about 326,000 gallons, more than enough to supply two households for a year.) To suddenly end that supply without first conducting an environmental review violates the California Environmental Quality Act, plaintiffs say.
“What we asked the DWP to do in this lawsuit is simple,” said Stacey Simon, the attorney representing Mono County in the case. “Before making drastic changes which impact ecosystems and environment across an entire region, take time to figure out what those changes mean not only to the eastern Sierra, but also downstream in Los Angeles.
“It is not only the right and responsible thing to do,” she said, “it is also the law.”
The California Department of Fish and Wildlife has also entered the fray on behalf ofMono Countyout of concern for the survival of one of the most legally contested birds in America, a genetically distinct clan of sage grouse unique to the California-Nevada border.
In court documents, state wildlife officials argue that the DWP should have conducted an environmental review before warning ranchers to prepare for “dry leases” on pasturelands that overlap sage grouse strongholds.
The DWP has promised to continue providing water needed to “reasonably support” the sage grouse in southern Mono County’s Long Valley. But state wildlife officials dismiss that strategy as “stabs in the dark” because it is not supported by a scientific study to determine how much water is needed to sustain the sage grouse and its habitat.
The DWP has said the water giveaways have become an extravagance due to changes in the climate — specifically, less snowpack, shorter rainy seasons and periods of prolonged drought.
The agency said in 2018 it would have to spend about $18 million to replace the water requested annually by local ranchers and to make up for the lost hydropower it could generate — an unacceptable burden for L.A. ratepayers of about $30 per family per year.
In addition, they point out that water was never a guarantee tied to 20-year leases held by about a dozen ranchers in the area. They pay an average of $10 to $15 per acre, per year to graze on DWP property.
Final arguments in the case are scheduled to be heard on Feb. 11. A preliminary order issued recently by Alameda County Superior Court Judge Evelio  Grillo said the DWP must continue delivering water to its Long Valley lessees in historic quantities until it completes an environmental review.
Los Angeles acquired the land in the early 1900s, when city agents posed as ranchers and farmers to buy water rights in Mono and nearby Inyo counties with the goal of building an aqueduct system to meet the needs of the growing metropolis to the south. The diversion of water dealt a serious blow to local agriculture, and shifted the region’s economy toward tourism.
Water wars have defined the eastern Sierra Nevada region ever since. In previous legal battles, the DWP was forced to give up significant amounts of water to steady water levels in Mono Lake, re-water parts of the dry Owens Lake to help prevent dust storms and restore a 62-mile stretch of the Lower Owens River.
Lynn Boulton, a spokeswoman for the nonprofit group Keep Long Valley Green, supports local efforts aimed at “making it work to have both cattle grazing and sage grouse sharing meadows and pastures” irrigated with ample DWP water allotments.
Kristopher Hohag, former vice chairman of the Bishop Paiute Tribe and regional organizer for the Sierra Club, however, is not so sure. “Managing a complex landscape like this for dollars and cents,” he said, “is questionable because economic forces do not respect nature.”
But some conservationists cringe at the very notion of allowing both the DWP and commercial cattle ranchers to continue operating without accepting responsibility for the environmental damage they cause in the area just south of theMammoth Mountain ski resort.
Among them is Laura Cunningham, an ecologist and former state fisheries biologist familiar with the region’s spiderweb-like network of irrigation ditches, diversions, and dams.
As the sun rose over Long Valley on a recent weekday, Cunningham brought her  four-wheel-drive truck to an abrupt stop near a stretch of the Owens River shared for decades by nature enthusiasts, anglers, livestock and prized trout.
Moments later, she was striding toward a riverbank severely eroded by grazing cattle whose droppings had transformed gravel spawning grounds for fish into muck the consistency of peanut butter.
Cunningham reached down and scooped up a handful of mud from the shallows. “Trout thrive in streams with cold, clean water and rocky sand on which to lay their eggs,” she said, shaking her head. “Yet, this is what they’ve got to live with here.”
The surrounding meadows of grass and bulrush grazed to their roots, “were once home to herds of antelope, and thousands of sage grouse,” she said.
“Sage grouse populations are now crashing,” added Cunningham, California director of Western Watersheds Project. The project, along with the Center for Biological Diversity and WildEarth Guardians, is part of a coalition that filed suit last year against the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service for failing to shield the bird from livestock grazing, mining and the great thirst of the city.
Overall, she said, the decline of Long Valley’s landscape can be expressed in stark simplicity: “Science and economics get political in a hurry around these parts.”

How wildfires became ripe areas for right-wing conspiracy theories,https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2021-01-30/a-space-laser-did-it-gop-congressman-had-out-there-theory-on-deadly-california-wildfire,2021-01-30,"When Lilli Heart fled California’s deadliest wildfire in 2018, she was stuck in traffic for two hours outside the town of Paradise with her two cats in a car that was running low on gas.
Asthe septuagenariansat behind the wheel on Neal Road — waiting helplessly while the Camp fire destroyed her two-bedroom house — she saw a huge, dark cloud in the sky. She saw firetrucks. She saw the fear in the eyes of others trying to escape.
“All I saw was a bunch of really, really scared people trying to get the hell out of there,” said Heart, 74.
What Heart did not see is this: laser beams.
That, apparently, might come as a surprise to a newly elected Republican congresswoman known for supporting the QAnon conspiracy theory, making anti-Semitic and anti-Muslim comments, and falsely suggesting that school shootings in Newtown, Conn., and Parkland, Fla., were staged.
The Camp fire, which killed 85 people and destroyed more than 13,900 homes, is the latest focus of conspiracy theories spread by Rep. Marjorie Taylor  Greene (R-Ga.), who speculated that the blaze might have been started by a laser beam in space. Greene made the claim in a now-deleted Facebook post that was reported this weekby Media Matters for America, a liberal watchdog group.
“It’s crazy,” Heart said. “Eighty-five people died in that fire. I lost my whole life of collections, artworks, things that I worked for my whole life. For someone to make light of it like that — it really hurts.”
In the meandering  November 2018 Facebook post, Greene theorized that a space-based solar generator, used in a clean-energy experiment with the goal of replacing coal and oil, could have beamed the sun’s energy back to Earth and started the fire.
“There are all these people,” she wrote, “who have said they saw what looked like lasers or blue beams of light causing the fires ... If they are beaming the suns [sic] energy back to Earth, I’m sure they wouldn’t ever miss a transmitter receiving station right??!! ... Could that cause a fire? Hmmm, I don’t know.”
California wildfires have been ripe for conspiracy for years, but Greene’s comments surface at a time when a sizable segment of the American population is treating false conjecture as fact — from armed people in Oregon on the lookout for so-called antifa members starting blazes to the mob that attacked the U.S. Capitol based on former President Trump’s baseless claims of a rigged election.
Greene’s post speculated that former Gov. Jerry Brown, Pacific Gas & Electric, and Rothschild Inc. — an investment firm that has long been the target ofanti-Semitic conspiracy theoriesaccusing Jewish people of controlling global affairs — were involved. It also falsely claims that the blaze followed the path of California’s planned high-speed rail line.
Republican leaders havefaced increasing pressureover their handling of Greene, who was assigned this month to the House Education and Labor Committee. A  representative for House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Bakersfield) did not respond to requests for comment.
In response to a question from The Times about Greene’s theory about the Camp fire, a spokesman for Rep. Doug LaMalfa (R-Richvale), who represents Paradise, wrote: “Congressman LaMalfa believes that poor forest management practices advocated by misguided environmentalists have caused dangerous fuel loads and increasingly severe Western wildfires. He has led the conversation in Congress for reform and next month will introduce a wide-ranging package of bills to prevent future wildfires and minimize wildfire risk.”
He did not address Greene’s comments.
Greene put outa statementFriday addressed to “the radical, left-wing Democrat mob and the Fake News media trying to take me out.”
“I will never back down,” she wrote. “I will never give up. ... More MAGA reinforcements are on the way.”
Greene’s comments have incensed people who lived through tragedies she has speculated about.
Fred Guttenberg, whose 14-year-old daughter Jaimewas fatally shotalong with 16 other people at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla., in 2018, was scrolling through Twitter on Thursday night when he saw the phrase “Jewish space laser” trending. When Guttenberg, who is Jewish, realized it was about Greene’s post, he was disgusted.
“Shedeniesthat my daughter died in Parkland ... and yet, because my last name is Guttenberg, because I am Jewish, she thinks I shoot lasers at forests and start fires,” Guttenberg told The Times. “You can’t make this up.”
Guttenberg said he holds McCarthy and other GOP leaders responsible and said they “need to take her at her word and do something before someone gets hurt.” He said he found no humor in Greene’s speculation about the Camp fire.
“There are a lot of people who are willing to believe these things,” he said. “They use a universe of alternative facts to justify engaging in violence ... It can’t be allowed to continue.”
The Camp fire was sparked by PG&E electrical equipment, some of which was nearly100 years old. The companypleaded guiltyto 84 counts of involuntary manslaughter last June.
“If a Jewish laser was able to accurately target the rusted-out, 100-year-old transmission tower that caused the fire, what a good shot they were. It was a hell of a good shot,” Lee Houskeeper, a media consultant  for a law firm that represented scores of Camp fire victims in lawsuits against PG&E, told The Times, sarcastically.
Skepticism toward government messaging isn’t new, and knocking down rumors has always been part of the job for crisis communicators. But now, in the age of social media, false information spreads like, well, wildfire and can be dangerous in real time when officials need to quickly share the facts about fast-moving crises.
“The one challenging aspect all fire departments, all government entities face is, the information we post is verified and … there are times the general public is able to post something online that gets traction just based on their perception of what’s happening,” said Nick Schuler, a deputy fire chief with the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection.
“If I were down at the beach today and posted ‘Hey, a giant wave took out the sea wall,’ you’d have several people re-sharing that information, posting it, probably before the city would be able to say ‘No, that’s not correct.’”
Schuler recalled getting a flurry of media inquiries in 2017 when people began to wrongly connecta massive solar flarewith wildfires in San Diego.
Last year, firefighting crews in Oregon encountered groups of people who were convinced that wildfires burning there were started by antifa. The people were stopping residents from moving on local roads and, in at least one case, prohibited firefighters from going onto their property to help set up a defensive position for oncoming flames.
When fires are extreme or wind-driven, their burn patterns can seem completely illogical to the uninitiated, and thus ripe for conspiracy as people try to make sense of what happened, said Jack Cohen, a wildfire expert and retired U.S. Forest Service firefighter.
The Carr fire that burned in Shasta and Trinity counties in Northern California in 2018 seemed to char every inch of forest in some areas, but one or two homes would survive. During the Camp fire later that year, much of the tree line remained intact, but homes tucked within them were destroyed.
Cohen said he first started hearing conspiracy theories about space-based directed-energy weapons after high-definition drone images showed the Camp fire’s pattern of destruction. People he said, are “obscenely obsessed” with what causes wildfires and fill in the blanks when they can’t explain them.
While people are impressed by high-intensity big flames, he said, the reality is that many homes and structures are destroyed more slowly during wildfires by burning embers and low-intensity surface fires that linger in vegetation.
Steve Crowder, the mayor of Paradise, said he is more focused on rebuilding than on listening to theories about space lasers.
“People are definitely still suffering and there are people who will never get over it,” he said. “I don’t think statements like that make a whole lot of difference one way or another. I don’t take it too seriously.”
Crowder said the town has already rebuilt 600 buildings and that PG&E is installing underground power lines throughout Paradise. Eventually, he said, Paradise will be more advanced than many other municipalities in terms of fire safety and communications.
“Don’t waste your time on the myths,” he advised.
Anastasia and Daniel Skinner laughed when they heard Greene’s theory.
In early 2019, the couple were living in an RV on their scorched property. Money was tight as they paid for water, propane, gas and other necessities for their five young children — costs that amounted to more than their monthly mortgage for the home the fire destroyed.
Then, the RV was stolen. Another property the couple own in the area was being foreclosed. They had hoped settlement money from PG&E would help save that home, but they haven’t seen a dime.
To hear a politician from another state spreading rumors about the fire that upended their lives is “silly” and “annoying,” Anastasia said.
“There’s no way to prove lasers from space would have caused the fire,” Daniel said. “But she’s getting a lot of attention.”
Meanwhile, he said, victims and people who actually do help families like his don’t get enough of it.

Progress made on wildlife corridor connecting O.C. coast with Cleveland National Forest,https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2021-01-29/progress-made-on-crucial-wildlife-corridor-connecting-o-c-coast-with-cleveland-national-forest,2021-01-30,"During the Laguna Beach fire of 1993, many animals had difficulty retreating from the massive blaze due to a lack of open space.
About 20% of Orange County’sgnatcatchers, an endangered songbird, were killed in the fire, which causeddevastating damage, burning 16,000 acres and hundreds of homes.
Then, in the wake of the fire, animals from the surrounding habitat could not access coastal areas to replenish their populations.
Nearly three decades later, some progress has been made on a wildlife corridor funded, designed and constructed by Great Park developer FivePoint Holdings. The company is working alongside the environmental group Laguna Greenbelt, which has fought for the corridor since the 1990s.
FivePoint has been working on restoring 2.5 miles of the 6-mile corridor since the project’sgroundbreakingin early 2018. When finished, the corridor will connect the Cleveland National Forest with Orange County’s wild coastal terrains. The grounds were formerly used for agriculture and the Marine Corps Air Station El Toro golf course.
“Significant progress has been made toward connecting two of the largest open spaces in Orange County, which are vital to the well-being of wildlife that live and move throughout the area,” said FivePoint Chief Operating Officer Lynn Jochim. “We are grateful for our partnership with Laguna Greenbelt and the industry experts we have worked closely with to complete the connection between 20,000 acres of coastal chaparral and the Santa Ana Mountains. We remain dedicated to continued stewardship of the land and collaboration with our partners to finish this critical environmental link for Irvine, the region and generations to come.”
The corridor will encourage biological diversity among the animals that dwell in the coastal chaparral surrounding Laguna Beach, officials say. The gray fox, bobcat, coyote and various native birds are among the wildlife that will be able to travel between coastal habitat and the Santa Ana Mountains. More open space means more potential mates to encourage biodiversity.
“It’s crucial, particularly to the coastal wilderness area around Laguna Beach — if we’re cutting that off and essentially making an island from the rest of the region ... the animals that live in the wild along the coast are really going to suffer, because they need genetic diversity,” said Gabriela Worrel, outreach coordinator with Laguna Greenbelt.
Diversity is crucial in animal populations because it safeguards against singular catastrophic events. If animals are mating with family members and reintroducing the same traits into the collective genome, a single disease could wash through the population and wreak havoc.
Worrel said genetic testing has revealed that some of the animals living in the wilderness parks along the coast are showing signs of genetic degradation.
“Additionally, consider climate change and what’s happening with wildfires and how that’s going to increase,” Worrel said. “The best thing for nature is to have these escape routes that animals can use to go to another area when there’s a fire. And then it allows them to come back into the area as well when that disaster is over. So, those things are all crucial for maintaining our habitat on the coast.”
Laguna Greenbelt has contributed to a number of environmental successes in the county, including establishing the 22,000-acre greenbelt around Laguna Beach, Crystal Cove State Park and the 38,000-acre Nature Reserve of Orange County.
The city of Irvine, which owns the land where the wildlife corridor is being built, has reviewed the planning and construction documents and is monitoring the project’s progress.
In the last year and a half, FivePoint has planted 98% of the corridor’s vegetation, which includes more than 15,000 shrubs and plants, 24,000 cactuses and 4,500 trees. All irrigation lines have been installed; supplemental watering will be needed for the first few years as the infant vegetation grows. FivePoint has also sprayed 3.5 million square feet of hydroseed, which staves off erosion and encourages grass growth. About 60% of the needed fencing has been installed to keep people out of the area.
The project has faced some pandemic-related setbacks. It was difficult to get shipments of fencing at certain times over the past year, and crew availability has been a challenge.
Irvine spokeswoman Kristina Perrigoue said next steps for the project are “dependent on multiple variables and are still being evaluated.” Although the corridor was originally expected to be completed in mid-2019, Perrigoue said development is not moving slower than expected.
FivePoint has no estimate for when the work will be completed, a spokesman said: “This thing is moving at the pace that everybody expected, in the sense that there are a number of players involved, including wildlife agencies and others that need to check off on things as it progresses.”
He noted that more work needs to be done on a couple of “pinch points” where the corridor intersects with Barranca and Alton parkways.

“These are complex projects that involve engineering, science and a lot of input from different people, and the project is moving forward,” he said. “We’re, from our standpoint, very pleased with the progress that’s been made and where we are now, and I think we can certainly see the light at the end of the tunnel on this.”

Section of Highway 1 near Big Sur collapses in winter storm,https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2021-01-29/winter-storm-causes-landslides-in-big-sur,2021-01-29,"A scenic stretch of Highway 1 near Big Sur that collapsed because of a winter storm this week will cost millions of dollars to repair, and it is unclear how long it will take before the roadway is fixed, officials said.
The highway collapse occurred Thursday about 15 miles south of Big Sur, officials said.
Caltrans earlier closed 40 miles of Highway 1 between Fullers Lookout and the San Luis Obispo County line after a winter storm threatened mudslides near the Dolan Fire burn scar, officials said. The wildfire last fall burned over 128,000 acres, destroying vegetation and causing the soil to weaken.
“We wanted to have the closure in place just in case evacuations become mandatory,” said Caltrans spokesman Jim Shivers. Evacuation orders were never issued for the portion of the highway that collapsed, Shivers said.
Caltrans maintenance crews discovered the section of collapsed highway about 4 p.m. Thursday,  Shivers said. Caltrans issued an emergency contract to Papich Construction, he said.
The company will work under Caltrans engineers to ensure the repair is up to state standards, Shivers said. There is no timetable for the project’s completion.

The destruction is known as a slip out, a collapse that occurs when the soil on either side of the road is so saturated nothing can hold it, Shivers said.
Central Coast rainfall topped 15 inches this week, triggering mudflows that damaged at least 25 structures in the area, officials said.
Firefighters used earth-moving equipment Thursday to rescue ahorseandponyfrom deep mud near the Sierra de Salinas mountain range on the northeast side of theRiver fireburn scar. The wildfire burned more than 48,000 acres last fall. The soil thereis unstableand, without vegetation to hold it in place, at heightened risk for debris flows and mudslides.
A winter storm stalled in the region Thursday before moving to Southern California, bringing moderatemudslidesto Orange County andhailto Los Angeles County beaches.

Energy company to breed endangered California condors to replace birds killed by turbine blades,https://www.latimes.com/environment/story/2021-02-28/wind-power-company-will-breed-endangered-california-condors,2021-02-28,"ROSAMOND, Calif. —They are among the top goals of California environmentalists: preserving endangered species and replacing fossil fuels with clean energy.
Yet in the blustery skies above Kern County’s Tehachapi Mountains — where towering wind turbines churn with hypnotic rhythm — renewable energy and wildlife preservation appear to be headed for a disastrous collision.
After a decades-long effort to rescue the California condor from the brink of extinction, government officials say the critically endangered vultures are now at risk of being killed by spinning turbine blades.
Roughly 100 captive-bred condors currently soar above this rugged range between the Mojave Desert and the fertile Central Valley. Although there has yet to be a documented case of a wind turbine injuring or killing a condor, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service says condor collisions are inevitable if the population continues to balloon.
The growing potential for condor kills has alarmed not only federal authorities but environmentalists and power company officials as well. A wind farm could face lawsuits, criminal charges and ample bad publicity for investors. Condor deaths could also hamper one of the highest priorities of the Interior Department: the development and delivery of renewable energy.
Now, federal wildlife authorities are taking the unprecedented and controversial step of helping a wind energy company breed the scavengers in captivity, so that they can replace any birds that are killed by the massive wind converters.
In a  statement, Scott Sobiech, field supervisor for the wildlife service’s  Carlsbad and Palm Springs offices, said a draft plan for Avangrid Renewables’ Manzana Wind Power Project includes “working with a captive breeding facility to fund the breeding of additional condors for release into the wild.”
As “the species’ population in the wild increases, so does the potential for condor presence near wind energy facilities,” he said. “Conservation plans provide a mechanism for wind energy companies to manage impacts to condors and help us recover this federally endangered species.”
The plight of the California condor — the largest flying land bird in North America — highlights the complex issues facing wildlife authorities, private companies and regulators as they promote wind energy development along the Tehachapis and across the nation. It also adds urgency to efforts to make the technology safer for wildlife includingeagles,hawks and bats, thousands of which are killed each year by wind turbines.
Amy Parsons, operations wildlife compliance manager at Avangrid Renewables in Portland, Ore., said: “Our goal is to minimize the risk of mortalities. We see this as a win for condors.”
Environmentalists reluctantly agree.
“Having a conversation about raising condors — a poster child of the Endangered Species Act — to kill them is a hard pill to swallow,” said Joel Merriman of the American Bird Conservancy. “But it is also tough to pinpoint a better alternative.”
Garry George, clean energy director at the National Audubon Society, said, “If wind energy and the expanding condor population can’t get along, we’re not going to get very far in staving off catastrophic climate change or saving this magnificent creature from extinction.”
Gymnogyps californianushas been in jeopardy since the 1950s, when development began to encroach on the species’ habitat and the now-banned pesticide DDT made condor eggshells so thin they could not support life.
Some of the huge birds were shot or died of lead poisoning from spent ammunition left in the carcasses  of hunted animals. Wildfires and disease also took a toll on the species.
Scientists began recovery efforts by capturing the few remaining wild condors, breeding them in captivity and releasing the birds in their historical range.
Today, the population ofCalifornia condorsis 518 individuals, including 181 in captivity and 337 soaring over Ventura and Kern counties, the Sierra Nevada foothills, the Grand Canyon and Baja California, Mexico. For the first time in half a century, some condors are roosting near Yosemite National Park.
Still, condors born and bred in captivity and released into the wild must frequently be trapped to be  tested and treated for lead poisoning if necessary.
If the population continues to expand its range, scientists say, the species may be eligible for down-listing from its current critically endangered status to threatened within a few decades.
However, development of open spaces still poses a threat to the species.
In an unprecedented step condemned by environmentalists, the Fish and Wildlife Service in 2013 said operators of Terra-Gen Power’s wind farm in the Tehachapi Mountains would not be prosecuted if their turbines accidentally killed a condor during the expected 30-year lifespan of the project.
The agency also made an exception for the 270,000-acre Tejon Ranch Co. site, saying the government would not prosecute if construction of the company’s controversial 5,553-acre development of luxury homes, hotels and golf courses violated the harassment ban in the endangered species law.
In 2017 and 2018, biologists observed condors swooping down and perching on the ground and on rocks within 1¼ miles of the 5,515-acre Manzana wind farm.
The facility, which generates power for Los Angeles, parts of Silicon Valley and San Diego and Orange counties, has a current capacity of 189 megawatts. It consists of 126 General Electric 1.5-megawatt turbines that began operating in 2012. The turbines are spaced roughly 700 feet apart and have a rotor diameter of 253 feet.
Avangrid’s proposed mitigation project anticipates incidental “takes,” or fatal injuries, of up to two free-flying adult condors and the loss of their two chicks or two eggs over a period of 30 years.
It calls for providing $527,000 over  three years to produce six condors at the Oregon Zoo’s Jonsson Center for Wildlife Conservation, one of four facilities that raise captive-bred condors to increase the size of the free-flying population.
Avangrid is a corporate member of the zoo and provides it with significant annual donations to support recovery efforts for the birds, which weigh up to 22 pounds and normally produce only one chick every one to two years.
The proposed mitigation project’s funds would be used to pay for adding a new zoo employee, who would earn about $90,000 a year and rear the six condors until they are 1½ years old, the age at which scientists say the birds can fend for themselves in the wild.
The funding would also provide about $10,000 a year for incremental related costs including veterinary treatments and transportation of condors to release sites.
“We’re prepared to start this condor mitigation effort as early as this spring,” said Kelly Flaminio, who oversees the Oregon Zoo’s condor recovery efforts. “Our zoo already nurtures the second-largest breeding population of condors in the nation.”
If none of the captive-bred condors is killed at the wind farm over the 30-year period, Flaminio said, the project would boost the free-flying population by six birds.
If approved, the mitigation project would also, for the first time, seemingly establish a monetary value for an individual captive-bred California condor of about $87,833.
Critics include the Center for Biological Diversity, which argues that the company’s plan falls short. A more reasonable mitigation ratio, it said in comments filed with the Fish and Wildlife Service, “should provide funding to raise a minimum of 30 condors to 1.5 years of age when they are released into the wild.”
In the meantime, the Fish and Wildlife Service has outfitted most free-flying condors with a VHF transmitter, a GPS transmitter or both to track their locations.
In addition, wind farms including Manzana have already installed radar units, telemetry and optical systems they hope will protect birds from harm  by identifying incoming species early enough to switch off massive turbines and then — to minimize costs and maximize profits — turn them back on as quickly as possible.
However, thousands of wind turbines across the Tehachapis and the Bay Area’s Altamont Pass Wind Resource Area continue to kill birds of many species and are suspected of killing  federally protected golden eagles.
TheLos Angeles Department of Water and Power’s Pine Tree wind farm,about 100 miles north of Los Angeles, came under federal investigation in 2012 in connection with eight golden eagle carcasses found at the site over the previous two years.
On a recent weekday, as strong, cold southeasterly winds ripped through the creosote on the Tehachapi Mountains’ southern flanks, George, the Audubon clean energy director, expressed hope that efforts to expand the condor population were compatible with Southern California’s wind energy industry.
The survival of no other species will determine the fate of our environment, economy and culture like the California condor, he said, scanning the skies for signs of the immense birds.
“I work for the birds, not the company,” he said. “There hasn’t been a condor killed at a wind project, and we have to keep it that way. That’s why it is critical and encouraging that the wind industry is stepping up to the plate as a conservation partner.”

"Conservatives slam California, challenge Gavin Newsom at CPAC",https://www.latimes.com/politics/story/2021-02-27/cpac-california-newsom-challenge,2021-02-27,"Conservatives are taking aim at liberalism at the annual Conservative Political Action Conference in Florida this weekend.
The most emblematic of these targets? According to some speakers, it’s California and Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom.
Chief among the critics was Richard Grenell, a Californian and former Cabinet member under President Trump, who delivered remarks Saturday morning at the conference in Orlando.
Trump is scheduled to speak on Sunday, the conference’s closing day.
Grenell is well known within Trump circles and first served the administration in 2017 as the ambassador to Germany. In 2020 he briefly served as acting director of national intelligence.
In recent weeks, speculation has mounted that he will run for California governor in the event of a recall. Politico this month reported that Grenell was scoping out a team for a possible gubernatorial run. On Saturday, he dropped a not-so-subtle hint as he closed his CPAC remarks.
“In my three decades in American politics, I have never seen a better case for a recall than there is right now in California,” he said. “And of course, if a public official is still failing to deliver on their promises and you can’t limit their term, or recall them in time, there’s always another option: you can run against them yourself.”
Grenell entered the national political scene in the early 2000s, when he was appointed communications director for the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations by President George W. Bush. After leaving the administration in 2008, he started a political media and consulting business, appearing regularly on news shows and publications to comment on foreign affairs issues.
In 2012 he signed on as spokesman on foreign policy for Mitt Romney’s presidential campaign. When he joined Trump’s team in 2017, he became the highest ranking  federal officer to have come out as gay in the country.
If he does decide to run for governor, Grenell would join fellow Republicans Kevin Faulconer, the former San Diego mayor, and John Cox, the businessman who ran and lost against Newsom in 2018.
Grenell focused most of his remarks Saturday on foreign policy, but shifted into discussing ousting failed political leaders.
“If you want the best case possible for a recall campaign, take a look at my home state of California,” he said. “California used to be Reagan country, the shining example of business innovation and middle-class success. But now when you think of California, you think of out-of-control wildfires, of rolling blackouts, of schools still closed, of shuttered businesses, of bans of fracking and wealthy people jumping the vaccine line.”
“Did you know that Gavin Newsom, the California governor, originally purchased $1 billion of masks and other protective equipment from a Chinese company, when American companies with the same equipment were based in California?” he added.
California has been a consistent target among CPAC speakers, who point to the state as evidence of failed Democratic rule and over-regulation, especially during the pandemic.
On Friday, U.S. Sen. Mike Lee of Utah lobbed his own criticisms during a speech about the Bill of Rights.
“Just look at California. Sad, sad California. The people of California are recalling their governor, because they’ve had enough of these stringent closures,” Lee said to applause and cheers. “They’ve had enough of the encroachment upon their rights, and enough of the government telling them that they can enjoy a five-star meal at French Laundry with their governor, but they can’t go to church.”
Newsom recall organizers say they’re nearing their goal of collecting 2 million petition signatures. State law requires them to submit nearly 1.5 million valid signatures before March 17 to qualify for the ballot.
If the recall does qualify, Californians can expect a vote around November at the earliest, though there are ways Democrats could delay a recall election. There’s no limit to how many candidates can run. During the 2003 recall of Gov. Gray Davis, dozens of candidates threw their hats into the ring, including former child actor Gary Coleman and adult film star Mary Carey. Californians chose Arnold Schwarzenegger to replace Davis.
Chances that they  will vote Newsom out of office are low, some political experts say. The governor at this point has said little to nothing about the effort, instead deflecting questions by saying he is focused on COVID-19 vaccine distribution. Consultants and fellow California Democrats, meanwhile, are painting the recall as a partisan political effort.
“CPAC is exposing the Republican recall scheme as a partisan cause célèbre for out-of-state extremists dreaming about installing a Trump supporter as governor of California,” Newsom consultant Dan Newman said Saturday.
Rep. Devin Nunes (R-Tulare), while speaking at a CPAC session called “California Socialism: Promising Heaven, Delivering Hell,” endorsed the recall effort, saying it was some hope for California.
He didn’t endorse any specific Republicans, but said the GOP eventually would need to “rally behind one candidate” in order to be successful, adding there were a lot of promising potential candidates right now.
He also had a prediction for the Democratic side.
“The thing to watch for is when the left starts eating their own,” Nunes said. “As soon as a prominent Democrat announces that they’re going to run, that’s when it will probably slide and Newsom will have a good chance of actually being recalled.”
“They take a big risk by not putting a prominent Democrat on that ballot and only leaving it to Republicans,” he added.

"Fire roars through Compton industrial area, burning structures and buses",https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2021-02-26/compton-fire-roars-through-industrial-area-burning-structures-and-buses,2021-02-26,"A massive fire erupted in an industrial area of Compton early Friday, engulfing several structures and spreading to a lot where the blaze burned at least a dozen charter and school buses.
The fire broke out near North Santa Fe Avenue and East Weber Avenue just after 4:30 a.m., officials with the Los Angeles County Fire Department said. No injuries have been reported.
Aerial footagefrom KTLA-TV Channel 5 showed massive plumes of thick black smoke billowing into the air as multiple fire engines sprayed water onto the flames. Several wooden pallets and at least 12 buses were on fire.
The Compton Fire Department said the call initially came in as a “pole fire” involving Southern California Edison equipment.
Edison spokesman Robert Villegas confirmed that at least three nearby customers were without power and that repair crews were in the area, but he could not provide further details about the blaze.
Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Sgt. Andrew Leos said the fire  was so big it  could be seen from the 105 Freeway.
“It’s huge,” he said.

In addition to fire crews from L.A. County, firefighters from Compton, Santa Fe Springs, Montebello and Downey were battling the blaze. Power outages were reported in the area.
“It’s a big fire,” firefighter Jonathan Africa with the Montebello Fire Department said. “A bunch of buses were involved that were parked in the lot. They caught on fire, and the structures caught on fire.”
Video also showed residents of nearby apartment buildings evacuating, with one person describing loud booms and another in tears.
Leos said road closures were minimal, with “the exception of people rubbernecking,” and noted that any evacuations in the area were voluntary.
By midday Friday, mop-up efforts were underway and the blaze was “under control,” the Compton Fire Department said.
The cause of the fire remains under investigation.

Frantic calls of a prowler brought LAPD to Beverly Grove. They were too late to save a man who was fatally stabbed,https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2021-03-30/la-me-2-men-found-dead-houses-apart-in-beverly-grove-area-police-investigate-connection,2021-03-31,"Claudia Beaton was standing near her front window Monday afternoon, listening to a work call on speakerphone, when she saw a black SUV stop abruptly in front of her Beverly Grove home.
“Call 911 right now!” the driver shouted to her. There was an intruder, the driver said, jumping her neighbors’ fences, and he would soon be in her backyard.
But when she called 911, the dispatcher told her that they couldn’t send anyone until the intruder was on her property, Beaton said. Minutes later, she called 911 again. He was there.
Her husband yelled at the intruder to leave. The man leapt into another yard. A builder and city inspectors screamed at him to leave the yard of a home under construction. Police arrived but couldn’t find him, and left to search the street over.
Then, minutes later, a man, screaming for help. A haunting, gurgling, gasping sound. A doctor who lived nearby rushing to help. The police coming back to search again, and then later, warning everyone to get back in their homes.
“We’re searching for a murderer,” Beaton said authorities told them.
On Monday afternoon, residents near the 6600 block of Maryland Drive tried to stop the intruder before he stabbed their neighbor to death in his yard, then broke into another home where he apparently killed himself, according to preliminary reports from Los Angeles police.
The victim was later identified as Gabriel Donnay, 31, by the Los Angeles County Department of Medical Examiner-Coroner. Enoch Conners, 33, also identified by the coroner, is the suspected attacker.
Detectives believe Conners might have been living out of his car, which was found in a nearby alley, said Sgt. J. Mankey, a watch commander at the LAPD’s Wilshire community station.
Beaton was not the first neighbor to call authorities to report the man.
Less than an hour and a half before the stabbing, LAPD officers responded to the area after a homeowner called to report a trespasser, Chief Michel Moore confirmed Tuesday afternoon.
The officers spoke with the homeowner and the man suspected of trespassing, who is now the stabbing suspect, about 3:10 p.m., but concluded “there was no legal basis to make an arrest,” Moore said.
“He had expressed that he had some car trouble. We offered help, which he declined. He was not committing a crime at that point, and he did not appear to present a danger to himself or others,” Moore said.
That exchange is now being reviewed as part of the investigation into the stabbing to determine “how such a tragic event occurred,” he said.
“A lot more questions than answers at this point,” Moore said. “However, it is a deeply disturbing set of circumstances.”
A woman who lives next door to the house where the intruder killed himself said her husband saw him in the neighbor’s backyard before he disappeared into the house. Later, when the woman, who declined to give her name, watched footage from her home security camera, she said she saw the man trying to get into a crawl space near their driveway.
She said the incident left her feeling emotional and scared.
“How many tragedies ...,” she said, trailing off, as she stood behind her wooden front door wearing a white KN95 mask.
She’s lived in the area for 50 years. “What’s happening?” she said. “This is such a wonderful neighborhood.”
A street over, a crime scene cleanup crew was still working Tuesday afternoon inside the slain man’s home.
This weekend, Beaton and her neighbors plan to gather to discuss how they can reinforce their fences.
“You learn as a kid, the police got this — call them for help,” she said. “You need to help yourself and help your neighbors.”

"Newsom’s $1-billion wildfire plan favors logging over homeowners, critics say",https://www.latimes.com/environment/story/2021-04-30/newsom-california-wildfire-plan,2021-04-30,"SAN DIEGO —Robert Garant proudly showed off a collection of chain saws he’s used to maintain the nearly 2 acres he and his wife, Gladys, have lived on for 47 years in San Diego County’s bucolic mountain hamlet of Julian.
The retired school bus driver said pruning the oak trees and dense shrubbery around their home isn’t just an aesthetic endeavor. Maintaining what’s commonly known  as defensible space, he explained, can be a matter of life and death.
“We actually saved our house by clearing that whole perimeter,” said Garant, recalling the ferocious Cedar fire in 2003 that burned down over 2,800 buildings but spared their home. “The only thing I lost was a hose.”
For many rural and suburban Californians, the approach of hotter, longer days is tinged with trauma and a persistent fear.
With a tinder-dry summer on the horizon, Gov. Gavin Newsom has released an unprecedented$1-billion blueprintfor wildfire prevention, making  adealwith legislators in early April to fast-track more than half of the money.
The governor’s plan calls for clearing vegetation on half a million acres a year, up from the current annual pace of about 80,000 acres. The approach stems largely from anxiety over drought and invasive beetles, which killed nearly 150 million trees last decade in the Sierra Nevada.
However, a growing chorus of wildfire experts and environmental groups say Newsom’s plan shortchanges homeowners like the Garants  — prioritizing logging and other projects ill-suited to stop the type of wind-driven blazes that have repeatedlydevastatedcommunities across the state.
That’s especially true, researchers say, in Southern California, where wildfires predominantly burn though chaparral and grasslands, blasting communities with ember storms, such as in the 2007 Harris fire in San Diego County,  the 2017 Thomas fire in Santa Barbara and Ventura counties and the 2018 Woolsey fire in  Ventura and Los Angeles counties. But it also applies to the recent spate of blazes that have plagued northern parts of the state, including the Tubbs, Nuns and Camp fires.
“There is a pretty big disconnect between this budget and trying to do something about the loss of lives and homes,” said Max Moritz, a widely recognizedwildfire expertwith the University of California Cooperative Extension in Santa Barbara. “Those forest treatments, they don’t do barely anything to alleviate the risk to human communities.”
Newsom’s team was quick to point out that, while the state spends billions on wildfire suppression, largely through the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection, it has never dedicated such resources to prevention.
As part of this effort, the state plans to launch a pilot program with the Federal Emergency Management Agency to provide money for home retrofits, such as sealing off eaves and installing ember-resistant vents. The recently approved funding also provides some discretionary money that local groups will likely be able to use for programs such as defensible space assistance and free wood chipping to dispose of cleared vegetation.
“This proposed budget really does represent a paradigm shift in the state’s approach on wildfire,” said California Natural Resources Secretary Wade Crowfoot. “This is a quantum-leap investment in upfront action to reduce the risk of catastrophic wildfire.”
Still, critics say Sacramento’s spending priorities are backward. While landscape-scale vegetation treatments most appropriate for forests would receive more than $500 million, the governor’s budget ponies up just $25 million for the home-hardening pilot.
“This is the tragedy of those numbers,” said Char Miller, a professor of environmental analysis at Pomona College who has written extensively about wildfires. “We know that clearing defensible space is far, far cheaper and more efficient than the massive mechanical clearing that this proposal will fund.”
Fifteen of California’s 20 most destructive wildfires have occurred since 2015, following a pattern that overwhelmingly unfolds outside of the state’s most heavily forested areas.
In late summer and autumn, strong wing  gusts, often called Santa Ana or diablo winds, have repeatedly whipped up fast-moving blazes though bone-dry vegetation, most commonly shrublands. Those blazes blow embers into nearby communities, where homes explode into flames as firebrands torch unkempt landscaping, slip through vents to ignite attics, and land in gutters filled with dry leaves.
If just one untidy home in a community catches fire, it can be enough to put all the surrounding structures in danger. It’s not uncommon to find an entire subdivision burned to the ground while large pine trees loom nearby relatively unscathed.
Robert Garant knows this and so does the Julian community. The 94-year-old recently had a pacemaker implanted in his chest. With his landscaping routine on hold, the couple fretted about the increasingly overgrown state of their property, especially as the days warmed.
“We tried to do it ourselves,” said Gladys Garant, 86. “He did the best he could every day. I used to drive the tractor and mow. It’s hard. That’s all I can say.”
The Garants said there’s no way they could afford to pay for the work on their limited income. The cost, which included removing numerous dead oak trees, topped $14,000.
Luckily, the couple lives next to a family that started the successful Pope Tree Service. The neighbors helped them qualify for a financial-assistance program, and a crew of workers overhauled their property a few weeks ago.
“I know what this means when they come over here and do this work,” Robert Garant said, still gripping an old chain saw. “I pray to God, ‘Thank you for sending these guys.’”
The Garants were fortunate. But help is hard to come by.
Officials with the Resource Conservation District of Greater San Diego County — which runs the region’s primary defensible-space assistance and free chipping program — says demand always exceeds its resources. In fact, the district doesn’t widely advertise because it  quickly goes through the roughly $250,000 it receives annually from San Diego Gas & Electric and the federal government to help homeowners.
“There’s never enough money for that type of work,” said Sheryl Landrum, the district’s executive director. “We’re always desperate for funds to help people keep their property clear.”
It’s unknown exactly how many homeowners in California need  financial assistance with home hardening and defensible space. But the $25-million home retrofit program, which is expected to be supplemented by  another $75 million from FEMA, could eventually answer that question.
The pilot is required under a lawspearheadedby Assemblyman Jim Wood (D-Healdsburg), who said he proposed the legislation in response to concerns from community members who’ve had direct experience with devastating wind-driven blazes, such as the 2017 Tubbs fire.
“It’s one thing to have adequate resources for wildfire preparedness, it’s another to carefully assess what’s needed in home hardening and defensible space,” Wood recently told the San Diego Union-Tribune. “We don’t exactly know what that need is, but we know it’s huge.”
About 15% of the roughly 160,000 homes Cal Fire inspected last year were initially in violation of defensible space rules. Inspectors routinely had to visit homes up to three or four times before homeowners cleared their property.
However, in about half of the cases where a homeowner was in violation of the defensible space code, Cal Fire never followed up with a return visit, according to agency data.
Last year, the firefighting behemoth visited about 20% of the roughly 700,000 properties it has jurisdiction over. Records show that fewer than one in five homes had both sealed eaves and ember-resistant vents.
The debate around whether to log the Sierra Nevada in the name of wildfire prevention started around 2015, at the height of California’s worst drought in recorded history.
In September of that year, wind-driven blazes — already common to Southern California — brought previously unseen levels of destruction to northern parts of the state.
The incredibly fast-spreading Butte fire, for example, sparked when a tree fell on a Pacific Gas & Electric power line, burned through the rugged brush, timber and grass-covered hillsides of Amador and Calaveras counties. Fueled by triple-digit heat, dry conditions and ember-laden winds, the blaze destroyed more than 900 structures.
Just a few days later, faulty wiring of a hot tub ignited grass around a home in the rural community of Cobb, starting the Valley fire. Erratic winds fanned flames mostly through shrub and grasslands, eventually destroying nearly 2,000 structures throughout Lake, Napa and Sonoma counties.
In October 2015, then-Gov. Jerry Browndeclareda state of emergency due to unprecedented levels of dead and dying trees in the Sierra Nevada, creating the Tree Mortality Task Force. The call to action emphasized the idea that the forest die-off “significantly worsens wildfire risk.”
The federal government, which owns and manages more than half of the state’s forested lands, got to work removing trees that posed falling hazards along roadsides and power lines. The state’s task force and federal officials helped coordinate the removal of more than 1.5 million dead trees through the end of the decade.
Out of that effort grew the Forest Management Task Force, established in 2018 to “introduce a more holistic, integrated approach toward effective forest management.” Along with continuing to remove dead trees, the task force set its sights on thinning out overgrown forests.
Newsom established ashared targetwith the U.S. Forest Service last summer to scale up logging and fuel treatments on private, state and federal lands from about 330,000 acres a year to 1 million acres annually by 2025.
As calls for forest thinning have ramped up, so have questions about the extent to which such logging prevents wildfire.
Environmental activists have criticized the thinning projects for removing dead and dying trees that provide valuable habitat for birds, small mammals and other species that feed or make their home in the hollowed-out logs.
They’ve also pointed to an emerging body ofscientific literature, largely from the University of Colorado, that found wind and drought conditions greatly overshadow any impact from  trees killed by beetles.
Some scientists in California have pushed back on these findings, saying the science isn’t yet conclusive on the extent to which tree mortality drives massive wildfires. They’ve repeatedly expressed worries that logs are piling up across forest landscapes, providing huge amounts of dangerous fuel.
A February 2018paperfrom researchers at UC Berkeleysuggestedthe resulting firestorms could resemble the firebombing of Dresden, Germany, in World War II.
They’ve specifically pointed to last year’s Creek fire in Fresno and Madera counties as a prime example. Hot and dry conditions as well as large amounts of woody debris fueled the blaze, which burned 377,693 acres and destroyed 853 homes. The fire was so large itcreatedits own  weather system.
The fire burned through parts of the Sierra National Forest that had recently seen vegetation and tree removal. While that didn’t stop the fire, officials said it lessened devastation.
“You had a lot of homes saved because of that fuel reduction work,” said Jessica Morse, deputy secretary for forest resources management at the California Natural Resources Agency. “You need strategic fuel breaks so that people can escape during fire. That’s often what saves a lot of lives.”
However, researchers have acknowledged that forest logging and other vegetation management projects often center less on preventing structure loss and more on protecting natural ecosystems.
A legacy of commercial logging and aggressive fire suppression have left mid- to lower-elevation conifer forests choked with younger trees competing for ever-more scarce amounts of water. The concern is that large wildfires, exacerbated by these conditions, will increasingly damage  watersheds that supply agricultural and urban areas.
Malcolm North, a researcher at UC Davis and one of the state’s top authorities on forest ecology and fire, has defended the state’s approach. He said that, if done correctly, forest thinning should help protect the Sierra Nevada against the worst impacts of drought and invasive beetles.
“There’s too many straws in the ground,” he said. “You’re going to get a lot of dead trees unless you reduce the competitive demand for soil moisture.”
He also recently told the Union-Tribune that such projects do little to prevent blazes fueled by high winds and drought, such as the 2018 Camp fire. The state’s most deadly and destructive blaze burned 18,804 structures and killed 85 people, wiping out roughly 85% of the town of Paradise.
“It started in grass under power lines and got into basically chaparral,” North said. “If you had a bunch of dead trees, it’s hard for me to imagine it would have changed the hellacious conditions.”
Every year, the state intentionally burns thousands of acres to thin forests — but those efforts pale in comparison to what nature once did on its own, before humans started fighting fires.
Scientists estimated that prior to the 1800s, wildfire scorched about4.5 million acresa year throughout California. Today, thanks to billions of dollars spent on firefighting, the annual average is roughly1 million acres, although 2020 saw more than 4.2 million acres goes up in smoke.
What’s changed most recently is how wildfire affects humans. All but three of the state’s 20 most destructive wildfires have occurred since the turn of the century, with an average of nearly 3,000 structures destroyed annually, according to Cal Fire data.
People have increasingly built homes in the most fire-prone landscapes in the state — rolling, canyon-riven hills covered in oak, chaparral and highly flammable grasses.
Humans also have been responsible for starting about 97% of wildfires, according to astudylast year from the University of Colorado.
“The problem is humans igniting fire during wind events,” said Jon Keeley, a senior scientist at the U.S. Geological Survey’s Western Ecological Research Center.
Keeley and researcher Alexandra Syphard published astudyin 2019 establishing that many fires throughout the state have little to do with overgrown forests and everything to do with hot, dry and windy conditions. The findings, which came in response to the call for increased forest management, attempted to highlight the need for home hardening and private landscaping.
While logging and other vegetation treatments may prove crucial for forests, researchers have found that clearing chaparral shrublands can increase wildfire risks by inviting the spread of highly flammable invasive grasses.
A follow-upreportfrom that year found that certain structural characteristics of a home significantly correlated with surviving wildfire, most notably having closed eaves, screened vents and multipaned windows.
Syphard, chief scientist for La Jolla-based Sage Underwriters, said she has recently gathered data that bolsters those initial findings.
According to her most recent analysis, wildfire starts in grass, shrub and oak woodlands about 57% of the time, compared with just 14% in conifer forests. Perhaps that’s not surprising, since forests make up less than 20% of vegetation in California.
Even more revealing, however, is that those three landscapes have accounted for more than 60% of all the area burned in wildfires that involved structure loss between 2000 and 2018 — compared with just 12% for forests.
“The fires that result in destroyed structures, a very small percentage of that is in conifer forests, which runs contrary to what most people think,” Syphard said.

"How a first date may have led to a murder, a cover-up and a huge wildfire that killed 2",https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2021-04-29/lnu-lightning-complex-fire-started-as-a-cover-up-for-murder-police-say,2021-04-29,"It was a first date out of a horror movie, authorities say.
Priscilla Castro, a 32-year-old from Vallejo, was headed to Vacaville on a Wednesday evening in August to meet Victor Serriteno, a 28-year-old she’d met through an online dating app.
But instead of romance, the interlude ended in multiple deaths and hundreds of thousands of fire-scorched acres, prosecutors say.
The person behind all the crimes, authorities say, is Serriteno, whom Solano County sheriff’s deputies arrested again Wednesday on suspicion of arson and murder in connection with the Markley fire, which killed two people and merged into last year’s devastatingLNU Lightning Complex fire. Serriteno was already in the county jail after authorities alleged he killed Castro.
“We believe Serriteno deliberately set the Markley fire in an attempt to conceal his crime,” Solano County Sheriff Tom Ferrara said at a news conference Wednesday.
The day after Castro and Serriteno’s planned meeting, ash began raining down on Vacaville. Dozens of residents wereforced to evacuatetheir homes, and smoke and darkness blanketed the region for days.
“This was an unprecedented fire in scale,” said Jackson Harris, a spokesman for the Solano County Sheriff’s Department. “There was a lot of cleanup and recovery and resources that were given to it.”
The Markley firekilled two Solano County residentsin their homes, according to the sheriff: Douglas Mai, 82, and Leon “James” Bone, 64. The blaze also fueled the LNU Lightning Complex fire, which the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection said began on Aug. 17 and tore through Napa, Sonoma, Yolo, Lake and Solano counties, burning 363,220 acres before firefighters finally extinguished it Oct. 2.
The LNU Lightning Complex is the 11th most destructive fire in California history,according to Cal Fire. It raced across land parched by severe drought, killing six people and leaving 1,491 destroyed structures in its wake.
“Homes were destroyed, properties were destroyed, animals were killed and livestock was killed,” Vacaville Police Lt. Bryan Larsen said. “It’s just a tragedy all around.”
Two days after Castro went missing, her family began to grow desperate. Her cellphone wasn’t picking up calls, and her social media hadn’t been updated in days. They called the Oakland Police Department. Hours later, Vacaville police received a report of an abandoned car — which turned out to be Castro’s — on Bush Street, near a picturesque community park.
World & Nation
If the wildfires in California seem worse every year, it’s not your imagination.
Detectives used cellphone records and analytic software on Sept. 2 to assist in a search for the missing woman. They found her charred remains in the Stebbins Cold Canyon Natural Reserve, a hilly spot around Lake Berryessa, roughly 20 miles north of Vacaville — the origin site of the Markley fire, investigators later discovered.
After several interviews as well as reviews of phone records and camera footage, Vacaville police arrested Serriteno on Sept. 11, and he was charged with murder in Castro’s death.
When asked whether Serriteno went to the area to dispose of Castro’s body, Larsen said, “That seems likely.” Police are still determining the exact cause of Castro’s death and the nature of her relationship with Serriteno, Larsen said.
“We are still investigating the details of their connection, but at this time, we believe this was their first physical contact,” he said in a text message Thursday.
The Solano County district attorney’s office added three additional charges against Serriteno on Wednesday: arson and two counts of murder for the two fire victims’ deaths. He is expected to be arraigned Friday.

Las Vegas is betting on the gamblers and tourists returning. Will lost jobs come back?,https://www.latimes.com/world-nation/story/2021-05-31/las-vegas-post-covid-reopening-economy-jobs,2021-06-01,"LAS VEGAS —He wore a silk shirt and kept a slight scent of cologne about him. He liked to talk. There was always someone to talk to, like the production assistant from Los Angeles who blew $1,200 on video poker. They all brought their stories to the 40-foot marble bar at the Rio hotel, and later to a less glamorous joint a few miles from the Strip.
It was a good life, and through the years, Bernard Sykes met Hollywood actresses and local characters, professional athletes including Mike Tyson, and first-time visitors to the United States. Sometimes, as customers swigged beers and sipped martinis, sharing the kind of intimacies told only to strangers, they’d slide a $100 bill across the counter as a tip.
Then, last spring, like a dust devil of bad luck, Sykes’ life shattered.
“They let me go immediately,” Sykes said, recalling the start of pandemic shutdowns that cost him his $14-an-hour job. “I’ve been out of work ever since.”
A year and two months since the coronavirus paralyzed the nation and droverecord unemployment— including staggeringly high percentages among service industry employees, who make up more than a quarter of this city’s workforce — the U.S. is emerging from the aftershock of a pandemic crisis that dimmed blackjack tables and led to long lines at food banks.
In Las Vegas, where gambling revenue plummeted by nearly 45% last year and tens of thousands of the city’s service industry employees remain out of work, casinos andrestaurants are set to returnto full capacity Tuesday. It is, in a sense, a test of America’s ability to reclaim itself. But the contours of that comeback are not fully drawn, and many wonder whether they will return to the livelihoods they lost or be forced into another year of uncertainty.
“There is all this talk from politicians and whatnot about Vegas coming back,” Sykes said. “But I’m still out of work … [and] so are so many others as well.”
But they’ll be coming soon — at least that’s what elected officials hope: the gamblers, suckers and all the rest, driving across the desert from California or landing at McCarran International Airport with connections from London and Beijing. The Las Vegas Strip’s allure is the promise of escape into a nonstop party, an all-hours pulse shaped by capitalistic excess and the vagaries of chance. The casinos didn’t close for even a day after the 9/11 terrorist attacks or aftera 2017 mass shootingalong the Strip that left 60 victims dead.
Yet Las Vegas went silent for nearly two months early in the pandemic, and since then, it has returned like a man slipping on his best suit piece by piece, inching back toward the days when the city welcomed a professional football team, hosted a Democratic presidential primary debate and saw its casinos rake in $6.5 billion in the year before people started wearing masks.
By April 2020, the unemployment rate — previously around 4% in Nevada and in Las Vegas — had climbed to nearly 30%. Democratic Gov. Steve Sisolak, who had initially ordered strict shutdowns, allowed casinos to reopen last summer, then lowered capacity limits with the fall and winter coronavirus surges. Capacity restrictions have fluctuated since.
“We’ve taken action to strike a balance between protecting public health and also protecting our fragile economy,” Sisolak said in a public address to Nevadans this month.
But critics say the partial shutdown unnecessarily hurt the state and its economic center of Las Vegas.
“If we had kept things open and observed distancing, we never would have been in this financial mess,” said Oscar Goodman, a former Las Vegas mayor.
The city made headlines in April 2020 when Goodman’s wife, current Las Vegas Mayor Carolyn Goodman, called for casinos and other nonessential businesses to reopen,suggesting that Las Vegas could serve as a test case— or, as she put it, “a control group” — on the dangers of the coronavirus.
Now, after a year of shutdowns and reopenings, the city is betting on revival.
John Restrepo, a longtime Las Vegas economist, said early revenue projections show tourists are starting to return.
“But how much they spend is another question,” he said. “The economy here is so dependent on tourism. So how the economy improves around the country will dictate how and if Vegas truly bounces back.”
Nevada recently received $4 billion in federal COVID-19 relief funds, with $130 million going directly to Las Vegas. But its comeback will be determined by how safe people feel in convention centers and on gambling floors. New guidelines released this month by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention say fully vaccinated people do not need to wear masks inside or outside. Most casinos agree.
Las Vegas: The Road Back
This is the first in a series of occasional articles about Las Vegas emerging from the COVID-19 pandemic.
These days, crowds of people gripping yard-tall margaritas have again packed the sidewalks lining the Strip. A familiar, unyielding sun beats down on marquees touting Bruno Mars’ upcoming six-night residency, and this month, the convention center welcomed one of its first trade shows since the shutdowns: the Tobacco Plus Expo. Thousands are expected to attend the World of Concrete trade show in June, featuring a bricklaying championship.
But not everywhere will reopen: Caesars Entertainment recently announced it was closing several smaller entertainment venues and shows.
Tourists stopped on a recent afternoon to snap pictures of the pink 1974 Cadillac Eldorado parked outside A Little White Wedding Chapel, where angels floated on a ceiling painted to look like the sky. Inside, Charolette Richards sat at a desk surrounded by pink walls and reminisced about the six decades she’s been in the Las Vegas wedding industry.
She’s married thousands of couples and overseen the nuptials of many celebrities, she said, including Bruce Willis and Demi Moore.
Las Vegas has more than 50 standalone chapels, which in 2018 generated $2 billion for the local economy. Last year, most had to close in March and April when Clark County suspended issuing marriage licenses.
Richards’ business took a roughly 30% cut last year, but she was luckier than most. The chapel is famous for its drive-through window, so couples don’t even have to get out of their cars for the ceremony.
“The window really saved us,” said Richards, a stylish 86-year-old woman with a soft voice.
A few minutes later, a Nissan SUV pulled up to the window. A woman sat behind the wheel, a white veil draped near her headrest, and her soon-to-be-husband smiled from the passenger’s side. From the back seat, two teenage boys waved.
“This work brings me so much joy,” Richards said. “A joy I leaned on this past year.”
But many locals are still yearning for a return to more stability. The Culinary Workers Union, which represents some 60,000 people who work in hotels here, said 98% of those employees, who are mostly Latino, Black or Asian American, were furloughed at some point during the pandemic shutdowns.
By this month, union officials said, only about half had been called back to work. The union urged state lawmakers in Carson City to pass a right-to-return law that would require employers to offer laid-off casino, hospitality and travel-related workers in Nevada their old or similar jobs before opening the positions to new applicants. Late Monday, as the legislative session adjourned, lawmakers here passed the bill.
California lawmakers recently passed a similar measure.
Still, many workers, including Yaneth Chavez, remain hopeful that they’ll eventually be called back. She’s lived in Las Vegas most of her life, meeting her husband while working at a casino.
For nearly 20 years, she prepared food at the Red Rock Casino. Her $18-an-hour salary helped pay for child care for her two sons, now 8 and 10, and family vacations. But then she got the letter.
“Layoffs at the Red Rock Casino will commence on May, 1, 2020,” it read, “and your layoff will occur at that time.”
“This broke my heart,” Chavez said on a recent morning outside her home in North Las Vegas. “The job gave me purpose.”
Over the last year, Chavez, 39, received unemployment benefits as she searched for new work. Last fall, she got an on-call job working events at Allegiant Stadium, a new multibillion-dollar facility where the NFL’s Raiders play. It’s nothing like the consistency of her casino job, she said, and she’s visited a food bank in recent months.
“This has all been very, very stressful,” she said.
For Sykes, the laid-off bartender, his days are now filled with busy work.
He once talked to actress Sanaa Lathan about Las Vegas’ best restaurants and Tyson about an upcoming fight. But he has since removed everything from the closets in his home and sorted through years of clutter. He pawned three diamond rings for $4,000 so he could pay bills. He spends a lot of time with his 3-year-old granddaughter and sometimes hops in his car to drive down Las Vegas Boulevard.
When the pandemic began, he parked and walked down the middle of the empty thoroughfare.
“It took my breath away,” he said. “Never in my life did I think I would see this city grind to a halt.”
Sykes has kept in touch with former co-workers and occasionally visits them inside the casino. The 56-year-old applied to new jobs in Las Vegas but hasn’t received callbacks, and he wonders whether it’s because of his age.
“A lot of these places want young bartenders who look a certain way,” he said.
On a recent afternoon, Sykes sat at a table in a strip mall near the Henderson casino where he once worked. A steady stream of cars pulled in, many of them driven by other locals looking for an excuse to get out of the house after a year of restrictions.
Sykes gazed at the cream-colored building with a massive marquee advertising 18-ounce king cut prime rib for $32. He said he wanted to get back to the man he was. Make some money, pour a drink for a stranger, talk about politics or the weather, listen to the shuffle of cards and the spin of roulette wheels, and laugh a little.

Gov. Gavin Newsom visited the scene Tuesday and was set to brief President BidenaboutCalifornia’s critical fire dangers and needs. The state has been devastated by ever-worsening wildfire the last few years, with 2020 being the most destructive on record.
It’s still early in the season, which tends to peak in the summer and fall in California. But extreme heat created conditions for several fires to explode this week.
The lightning-sparkedLava fire, in a fairly remote part of Siskiyou County, forced the evacuation of at least 8,000 residents Monday afternoon as gusty red flag conditions fueled the flames.
The blaze, which started Friday, is 19% contained. Smoke from the fire was expected todrift as far north as Medford, Ore., by Wednesday evening, according to the National Weather Service. More than 900 personnel are involved in battling the fire, according to officials with the Shasta-Trinity National Forest.
Fire crews made progress containing the northern and western edges of the fire Tuesday, but it continued to advance on the southeastern edge as winds swept in from the north, according to a Wednesday morning update from Shasta-Trinity National Forest. Most of the movement occurred on the slope in the timber stand on Mt. Shasta.
Dry conditions are expected to continue with south winds forecast through midmorning, switching northwest late in the afternoon, the update said.
Dangerously hot temperatures are expected at least through Thursday in central and eastern Siskiyou County and in Modoc, according to the weather service.
“Record-setting heat in Northern California, a lightning storm comes through, and you have the recipe for the perfect storm,” said Raj Singh, a public information officer for California Incident Management Team 14 of the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection.
Firefighters are concentrating on holding the north and west lines of the fire to protect the Lake Shastina, Mount Shasta Vista and Big Springs communities.
“We had a lot of resources on that end yesterday. That’s where the big threat was to the communities up there,” Singh said.
Crews are also attacking the fire on the southern edge, Singh said.
There have been no civilian injuries since the fire crew arrived on Monday, he said.
Firefighters are dealing with steep, rocky terrain, limited road access and limited water sources, according to Shasta-Trinity National Forest.
Due to the unpredictable weather, containment projections aren’t possible, Singh said. A single ember and a strong breeze could reignite the entire blaze, he said.
“Nature’s going to test this line to make sure it holds,” he said.
A fire of this size so early in the summer is highly unusual, Singh said, and could augur a physically draining period ahead for firefighters and support staff. Last year’s fire season was grueling, he said.
“By the end of the season, people were just exhausted,” he said.
The San Francisco Chronicle reported that a fire official with the Shasta-Trinity National Forest apologized to residents during a town hall meeting Monday for crews having initially left the site of the fire Friday when the blaze was no longer perceived to be a threat.
Adrienne Freeman, a spokesperson for the Shasta-Trinity National Forest, told The Times that after pouring thousands of gallons of water on the fire, officials with the agency had not been able to detect any more heat and had “no indication to continue suppression actions.”
But it rekindled shortly afterward, then exploded.
“It does happen,” she said. “It’s not terribly common.”
Deputies with the Siskiyou County Sheriff’s Officeshot and killed a manthey said opened fire on them in an evacuation zone of the Lava fire, authorities said.
Siskiyou County Sheriff Jeremiah LaRue told theSacramento Beethat officers tried to prevent the man from driving into the Mount Shasta Vista subdivision on Highway 97 north of Weed after it had been evacuated due to the fire Monday evening.
Evacuation orders were issued by the Siskiyou County Sheriff’s Office for Carrick Addition, Highway 97 from Weed to Deer Mountain Road, Lake Shastina, Rancho Hills, Juniper Valley and Mt. Shasta Vista. Highway 97 remains closed, according to Shasta-Trinity National Forest.
Siskiyou County was also battling the Tennant fire, which began Monday and by Wednesday had grown to more than 8,000 acres and was 5% contained, according to Kimberly DeVall, a spokesperson for the U.S. Forest Service.
By Tuesday evening, the Siskiyou County Sheriff’s Office had issued evacuation orders for Bray, East and West Ball Mountain Road, Old State Highway and Juanita Lake. There was also an evacuation warning for the Macdoel area, from Sheep Mountain Road in the north to Red Rock Road in the east as well as homes within a mile to the west of Macdoel.
The 118-acre Beswick Fire in Siskiyou County is 70% contained, according to the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection.
The Blue fire, located in Blue Canyon, began Tuesday afternoon. It is spreading at a moderate rate and has reached 400 acres, according to an incident update from Sierra National Forest.
Defying initial optimistic projections, winds shifted Tuesday evening, accelerating the fire’s spread. The area has a large amount of dead trees caused by bark beetle infestation and years of drought, according to Sierra National Forest.
More than 100 personnel are involved and that force will double, according to Sierra National Forest. As of Wednesday morning, the fire was 10% contained.
All of Road 10S02 has been closed and evacuated, said Alex Olow, a forest spokesperson.
Evacuations were also ordered Wednesday afternoon for the Salt fire in the Lakehead area of Shasta County, north of Redding.
The fire was reported at 1:55 p.m. east of Interstate 5 near the Salt Creek exit, said Suzi Johnson, a spokesperson for the Shasta-Trinity National Forest.
The blaze was initially reported at five acres but Johnson said officials believe it has grown since then.
About 2 p.m., the Shasta County Sheriff’s Office issued evacuations for Zola Drive, Cordes Court and Solus Campground Road, and warned that residents of Gregory Creek Road should shelter in place or go to Gregory Creek Beach. It later expanded evacuations to include Tom Head, Old Mill Road, Antlers View Road and Toms Head Road.
An evacuation warning has been issued for the Lakehead area east of I-5 to Riverview Drive. The northbound and southbound Salt Creek Road off-ramps have been closed because of evacuations.
An evacuation center has been established at Central Valley High School.
TheWillow firein Los Padres National Forest ignited June 18. As of Tuesday morning, it was holding steady at 2,877 acres and 87% containment, U.S. Forest Service spokeswoman Lynn Olson said.
The Shell fire, which began in Kern County on Sunday after a car caught fire on a roadside, is at 1,984 acres and 85% contained, according to the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection.
The Peak fire, now 100% contained, was also caused by a “single vehicle accident,” San Bernardino National Forest officials said onTwitter. The fire quickly spread to vegetation and reached about 35 acres Monday before its progress was stopped about 2 p.m., forest officials said.

How law enforcement uses social media campaigns to make arrests,https://www.latimes.com/california/newsletter/2021-06-30/arrests-social-media-campaigns-essential-california,2021-06-30,"Good morning, and welcome to the Essential Californianewsletter. It’sWednesday,June 30. I’m Justin Ray.
Metro reporter Maria L. La Ganga’s latest story looks closely at how law enforcement is using social media to make arrests.
Her story, “Police ‘wanted’ posters move to social media, nabbing suspects and ruining lives,” begins with the case of a Hermosa Beach bartender who was the subject of a wanted poster posted on the Manhattan Beach Police Department’s Facebook and Instagram pages. The posting sparked a barrage of online vitriol. One commenter identified where the bartender worked and his shift hours.
The problem is, he wasn’t a wanted man. There was no warrant out for his arrest on Feb. 26, 2020, when Manhattan Beach police posted the wanted sign, according to court documents.
“The 21st century version of the Wild West wanted poster has become a social media staple for police departments across the country,” La Ganga writes. “They’re posted on law enforcement Facebook, Twitter and Instagram accounts. Some departments have YouTube videos filled with stony-faced mug shots and pleas for help in identifying alleged suspects.”
While members of law enforcement told The Times that these social media campaigns have led to arrests, in many cases the posters stay online long after people have served their time or been cleared. But the lengthy public shaming can interfere with getting a job, renting an apartment and even future relationships.
La Ganga’s story explains the benefits and drawbacks to policing through social media, the LAPD’s use of the internet in investigations and the telling results of another police department’s aggressive “Public Enemy #1” campaign.Read the full story here.

Newsom sues to get party preference on recall ballot.California Gov. Gavin Newsom now faces an additional hurdle in his campaign to defeat a recall bid. In a state where registered Democrats outnumber registered Republicans nearly 2 to 1, the Democratic governor’s name may appear on the recall ballot without a party preference, thanks to a paperwork mistake made more than a year ago. As first reported by Courthouse News, Newsom filed a lawsuit Monday against California Secretary of State Shirley Weber asking the court to require Weber to print Newsom’s party preference on the recall ballots.Los Angeles Times

Lava fire swells to 13,300 acres.Crews are battling multiple wildfires across California while much of the region remains mired in treacherous heat and bone-dry conditions. The largest fire is the lightning-sparked Lava fire in Siskiyou County, which has forced at least 8,000 residents to flee. By Tuesday morning, the fire had expanded nearly tenfold, to 13,300 acres, and was 20% contained, Shasta-Trinity National Forest officials said.Los Angeles Times

More questions in Surfside building collapse
When theChamplain Towers Southin Surfside, Fla., collapsed less than a week ago, the building fell without warning in the middle of the night, 13 floors pancaking into a mountain of debris. As search and rescue teams scoured the rubble in hopes of finding someone alive, authorities Tuesday said 12people were confirmed deadand 149 remained unaccounted for in what could be the deadliest accidental building collapse in U.S. history.
The cause of Champlain’s sudden and spectacular fall Thursday remains undetermined. Someengineering expertssaythe tower’s collapse may have been due toa rare confluence of structural deficiencies and lack of maintenance in a coastal area where buildings are particularly vulnerable to corrosion from saltwater and salt air.
For many who live in the community, the disaster has fueledanxietyabout thechallenges of maintaining local residential buildings. A string of mid-rise and high-rise condos — some decades old, others brand-new — looms over the Atlantic shoreline sitting upon limestone, a porous rock that allows rising seawater to seep up from below.
In the coming decades, scientists say, buildings across coastal regions in the U.S. will be subjected to deepening challenges as sea levels rise and structures become increasingly exposed to saltwater.
Rise of the cell tower trees
A gentle breeze rustles the eucalyptus tree, its dark green foliage quivering under a cloudy Santa Ana sky. At the base of its sturdy trunk, the leaves of a fallen branch bear the scars of hungry insects. A stand of eucalyptuses sways across the road. But this tree, surrounded by a spiky metal fence, isn’t like the others.
This tree isn’t actually a tree at all — it’s acellular transmission tower, one among hundreds or more that now blanket Southern California.
Cell tower trees have become a memorable part of the L.A. landscape over the last few decades, sprouting beside freeways and in the city’s other in-between spaces. The demand for calls that never drop and videos that continuously stream is fueling the growth of these structures, whose fake foliage is meant to obscure the rectangular antennas clustered near their tops. But, the tree towerspresent an existential conundrum.

‘We can’t cut corners’: Biden pledges support for firefighters on front lines in West,https://www.latimes.com/politics/story/2021-06-30/biden-to-discuss-federal-wildfires-preparedness-with-newsom-and-other-western-governors,2021-06-30,"WASHINGTON —President Biden said Wednesday that his administration will boost federal pay for firefighters on the front lines of blazes that are intensifying across the West, part of a broader effort to confront what could be another devastating fire season.
“The truth is, we’re playing catch-up,” Biden said during a virtual meeting with Cabinet officials and Western state governors, including California’s Gavin Newsom. “This is an area that has been under-resourced, but that’s going to change if we have anything to do with it. We can’t cut corners when it comes to managing our wildfires or supporting our firefighters.”
Biden complained that firefighters make as little as $13 an hour — “Come on, man, that’s unacceptable” — and said the administration would deliver bonuses to bring salaries to at least $15 an hour.
Even that, he conceded, was not enough. Biden said his administration would work with Congress on more long-term solutions, such as changing part-time seasonal firefighting jobs into full-time positions, making them more attractive for workers and reflecting the reality that wildfires have become a year-round threat.
“These courageous women and men take an incredible risk of running toward the fire,” Biden said. “And they deserve to be paid and paid good wages.”
Newsom praised Biden for his focus on wildfires and climate change, saying that California and Washington, D.C., had previously been “sparring partners, not working partners.”
“I’ve been waiting 4½ years to hear a president say what you just said,” Newsom said, in a reference to former President Trump, whom he did not name.
Trump had denied  any link  between intensifying fires and climate change and blamed California for failing to“clean your forests”of combustible vegetation to prevent and stop wildfires.
Wednesday’s meeting was much like the briefings presidents have received for years at the start of hurricane season on the East Coast. Biden indicated such discussions about wildfire prevention and response likewise would become an annual event, reflecting growing concerns among experts and public officials that drought conditions and searing temperatures in the West were becoming the new normal.
This year’s fire season could outpace last year’s, which wasthe worst on record.Blazes have already ignited around California, where dry vegetation has left large swaths of the stateprimed to explodeinto flames.
California
Several major fires have been sparked in the last several days, and officials warn it is the harbinger of another bad fire season.
“We’re in as high risk of a starting condition as we could ever expect,” said Noah Diffenbaugh, a Stanford University professor who studies climate change and wildfires.
The California National Guard deployed a month earlier than it did last year, sending aircraft to drop flame retardant on the Lava fire near Mt. Shasta. It’s the largest active fire in the state, burning more than 13,000  acres since sparking Thursday.
At the same time, the U.S. Forest Service and the Bureau of Land Management have been wrestling with staffing problems exacerbated by low pay, competition from state and local fire departments and exhaustion from last year’s fire season.
More than a month after seasonal hiring typically would have ended, the federal government is still trying to fill vacant positions on hot shot crews, the most elite and experienced firefighting teams. Although these crews are venerated for leading the attack against the most difficult fires, some have had so many veteran firefighters quit that they’ve been downgraded to a lower-ranking status.
Biden’s approach will likely buoy experts and advocates who have been calling for a shift in how the federal government approaches wildfires.
“We’re at a point where we’re simply going to be overwhelmed year after year going forward, given the current systems we have in place,” said Jim Whittington, an expert in wildland fire response. “We really need to look at the way we staff and work wildland fires, the way we fund them and the way we take care of our people. We need a full reset.”
As part of that reset, Whittington and others say, firefighting should become a full-time job at higher pay.
Currently, the federal government fills its ranks each summer with thousands of seasonal firefighters who don’t get health insurance and are laid off after about six months. Some of these workers struggle at the end of the season as months of stress take their toll.
“We also need better mental health support for wildland firefighters,” Whittington said. “Too many face a crisis when they are laid off.”

‘Grueling work’: Viral photo shows toll California fires are taking on firefighters,https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2021-06-29/california-is-burning-firefighters-are-working-hard-to-keep-up,2021-06-30,"With  fire season  beginning earlier every year, blazes are burning across California even before the official start of summer and firefighters are already working relentlessly to protect the state’s wildlands.
A photograph posted on Twitter by the Los Padres National Forest staff that since has gone viral shows just how hard fire crews are working.
An image of Capt. Justin Grunewald, a firefighter with San Bernardino County’s Mill Creek Hotshots who was battling theWillow fire nearBig Sur, has received more than 9,000 likes on Twitter and has been shared more than 2,400 times.
The image, captured by Hotshots colleague Capt. Lincoln Peters andpublished Thursday, shows Grunewald sitting on a railing of the Horse Bridge near the Arroyo Seco Campground. Grunewald is covered in soot, his fire helmet resting upside-down at his feet and his shaved head bent forward as he seemingly gathers his strength for a return to the front lines of the fire.
Peters said that even after working during last year’sunprecedented fire season, he and Grunewald were surprised how long it took their feet to “toughen up.” “We’d walked I think about eight miles and 3,000-foot elevation gain,” he said of the day the photo was taken.
The Willow fire ignited around 8 p.m. June 17, forcing evacuations. In  13 days  it has charred 2,877 acres, according to theU.S. Forest Service’s incident report.
“The first several days were entirely an air show,” Forest Service spokesperson Lynn Olson said Tuesday. “Most of the work was done by helicopters ... dropping water on the fire.”
Firefighters — including Grunewald and Peters’ crew — were then tasked with scraping containment lines around the blaze. “Not only are they doing this grueling work, they’re doing it with a 50-pound backpack,” Olson said. “These men and women are extraordinarily strong and dedicated.”
California
State leaders in climate change and water resources warn that California’s drought is already causing dire conditions for people, plants, animals and land.
The heroic efforts of the firefighters haven’t gone unnoticed in the Twitterverse.
“Respect to those who fight the fires in our country, thank you for your service,”Lee Morintweeted, one of many messages of support left in the replies.
“We think we know how hard they work. But I am sure that what we imagine, doesn’t even come close to reality,” a user identified asRenee wrote. “Much gratitude to our firefighters!”
Although the Willow fire has scorched a swath of wilderness in the Los Padres National Forest, no structures have been damaged. Closures because of the fire are still in place, however, including the area around Arroyo Seco recreation and the eastern end of Pine Ridge Trail, Olson said. The blaze was 87% contained as of Tuesday, and fire officials have estimated July 11 for the blaze to be fully contained.
The fire is one ofmore than a dozen burning in Californiaamid the acceleration of the state’sdroughtconditions and record-setting heatblanketing the West.
Officials are warning residents to use extreme caution amid bone-dry conditions that are primed to erupt into fuel for wildfires.
“Make sure that if you’re going into a recreation area that accommodates boats or trailers that you’re not dragging chains, that you don’t have a campfire, that you don’t park your car where a hot catalytic converter could catch dry grass on fire,” Olson said.
And as the Fourth of July approaches, Olson reminded campers and hikers that fireworks are not permitted on any U.S. forest property.
“The No. 1 thing that the public can do to help is not be a part of starting fires.”

Deputies shoot and kill man as Lava fire encroaches on cannabis country in Siskiyou County,https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2021-06-29/police-shoot-kill-man-lava-fire-hits-cannabis-country,2021-06-29,"Deputies with the Siskiyou County Sheriff’s Office shot and killed a man they said opened fire on them in an evacuation zone of the Lava fire, authorities said.
Siskiyou County Sheriff Jeremiah LaRue told theSacramento Beethat officers tried to prevent the man from driving into the Mount Shasta Vista subdivision on Highway 97 north of Weed after it had been evacuated from the fire Monday evening.
The subdivision is home to a large complex of cannabis farmsrun primarily by Hmong families.
“They made contact with the driver. And at some point, the driver exhibited a firearm, a handgun, and pointed it at the officers,” LaRue told the Bee.
Politics
Facing his first wildfire season as president, Biden will discuss federal preparedness Wednesday with his Cabinet and Western governors, including Gavin Newsom.
A neighbor said he heard dozens of rounds fired in rapid succession over about 30 seconds.
LaRue did not immediately respond to requests for comment Tuesday.
The shooting occurred against a backdrop of tension between the Sheriff’s Office and the growers, including claims ofracial persecutionandcorruptionthat have been been linked to  the sheriff’s enforcement efforts.
Siskiyou County in recent years banned or limited cannabis operations. The county doesn’t allow commercial operations or outdoor grows, and has drastically limited the number of plants allowed on a property, according to the Bee. But, the news outlet says, authorities estimate that thousands of pot greenhouses are still active in the surrounding area.
California
Several major fires have been sparked in the last several days, and officials warn it is the harbinger of another bad fire season.
The Sheriff’s Office houses a dedicated marijuana eradication enforcement division, which in 2019 seized more than 60,000 illegal marijuana plants and 17,000 pounds of processed cannabis products in the county, according to itswebsite.
The victim in the shooting has not yet been identified.
The violence Monday erupted as the Lava fire grew tenfold, swelling by Tuesday to 13,330 acres. The Sheriff’s Office issued evacuation orders for the Lake Shastina and Juniper Valley areas on Monday, which remained in effect Tuesday afternoon.
Officials have alsoclosedHighway 97 between Weed and the Juniper Lodge, about a 30-mile stretch.

"As the West begins to burn, Biden to talk wildfires with Newsom and other governors",https://www.latimes.com/politics/story/2021-06-29/biden-wildfire-season-preparation-cabinet-newsom-other-governors,2021-06-29,"WASHINGTON —President Biden will meet Wednesday with Cabinet officials and leaders from Western states, including California Gov. Gavin Newsom, as he faces what could be another devastating year of wildfires with drought conditions worsening and searing temperatures spreading.
The situation has alarmed experts and public officials, who warn that this year’s fire season could outpace last year’s, which wasthe worst on record.Blazes have already ignited around California, where dry vegetation has left large swaths of the stateprimed to explodeinto flames, even as the federal government struggles to hire firefighters.
“We’re in as high risk of a starting condition as we could ever expect,” said Noah Diffenbaugh, a Stanford University professor who studies climate change and wildfires.
California
Several major fires have been sparked in the last several days, and officials warn it is the harbinger of another bad fire season.
The California National Guard deployed a month earlier than last year, sending aircraft to drop flame retardant on the Lava fire near Mt. Shasta. It’s the largest active fire in the state, burning more than 13,000 acres since sparking Thursday, and Newsom announced Tuesday that the federal government was going to help cover some of the costs.
Western states are eager for Washington to step up its commitment after President Trump repeatedly blamed them — particularly California, which he said failed to“clean your forests”of combustible vegetation — for failing to prevent and stop wildfires.
The threat comes amid staffing shortages at the U.S. Forest Service and the Bureau of Land Management, problems exacerbated by low pay, competition from state and local fire departments and exhaustion from last year’s fire season.
More than a month after seasonal hiring would typically have ended, the federal government is still trying to fill vacant positions on hot shot crews, the most elite and experienced firefighting teams. Although these crews are venerated for leading the attack against the most difficult fires, some have had so many veteran firefighters quit that they’ve been downgraded to a lower-ranking status.
Nationally, fire management teams are having to compete with each other for crews and equipment much earlier in the season than in years past. On June 22, the National Interagency Fire Center, which coordinates fire response from Boise, Idaho, raised the national preparedness to level 4 on a 1 to 5 scale, saying it was the second earliest it had reached that point.
The shortages have filled crews on the fire lines with anxiety and led to louder calls for change.
“We’re at a point where we’re simply going to be overwhelmed year after year going forward given the current systems we have in place,” said Jim Whittington, an expert in wildland fire response. “We really need to look at the way we staff and work wildland fires, the way we fund them, and the way we take care of our people. We need a full reset.”
Along with calls for higher pay — a first-year Forest Service firefighter currently earns a base wage of $13.45 an hour — there are those like Whittington who believe firefighting needs to become a full-time job. Currently, the federal government fills its ranks each summer with thousands of seasonal firefighters who don’t get health insurance and are laid off after about six months. Some of these workers struggle at the end of the season as months of stress take their toll.
“We also need better mental health support for wildland firefighters,” Whittington said. “Too many face a crisis when they are laid off.”
Biden said last week that he was surprised to learn that some federal firefighters earn so little.
“That’s a ridiculously low salary,” he said, banging his hand on a table in the Roosevelt Room in the White House during a meeting with emergency officials.
Kelly Martin, the president of Grassroots Wildland Firefighters, a group that advocates for better pay and working conditions for federal firefighters, said the problem has left critical positions empty.
“People risking their lives for our public safety deserve to be paid a living wage,” Martin said in a statement.

"Lava fire swells to 13,300 acres, forcing evacuations, as blazes ignite across California",https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2021-06-29/lava-fire-forces-evacuations-as-heat-wave-slams-california,2021-06-30,"In what is perhaps an ominous harbinger of the coming fire season, crews are battling multiple wildfires across California while much of the region remains mired in treacherous heat and bone-dry conditions.
The largest of the fires, the lightning-sparkedLava fire in Siskiyou County, forced the evacuation of at least 8,000 residents Monday afternoon as gusty red flag conditions fueled the searing flames.
By Tuesday morning, the fire had expanded nearly tenfold, to 13,300 acres, Shasta-Trinity National Forest officials said. By the evening, the fire was 19% contained and the National Weather Service had tweeted that smoke from the area couldcarry over to Medford, Ore.
“The fire made significant runs” Monday, said Michelle Carbonaro, a  spokesperson for the fire’s unified command team, noting that the northern border saw the most growth.
More than 470 personnel were battling the blaze from the air and the ground, she said, with crews working 24-hour shifts.
Footage captured by OnScene.TV near Highway 97 in Weed showed firefighters working late into the night while nearby brush and trees cracked and sizzled in the flames.
Evacuation orders for the Lake Shastina and Juniper Valley areas issued by theSiskiyou County Sheriff’s Officeremained in effect Tuesday. Carbonaro said crews were prioritizing the southern and western edges of the fire, which are closest to the communities.
The Red Cross has established anevacuation shelterat Jackson Street School in Yreka.
Officials alsoclosedHighway 97 between  Weed and the Juniper Lodge, about a 30-mile stretch.
The San Francisco Chronicle reported that a fire official with the Shasta-Trinity National Forest apologized to residents during a town hall Monday for crews having initially left the site of the fire Friday when the blaze was no longer perceived to be a threat.
Adrienne Freeman, a spokesperson for the Shasta-Trinity National Forest, told The Times that after pouring thousands of gallons of water on the fire, officials had not been able to detect any more heat and had “no indication to continue suppression actions.”
But it rekindled shortly afterward — eventually exploding to more than 13,000 acres.
“It does happen,” she said. “It’s not terribly common.”
Dangerously hot, dry weather is expected to improve as the week goes on, Carbonaro said, but crews Tuesday  had to contend with another day of difficult conditions.
“The area is under thatextreme heat waveof the whole Pacific Northwest,” Carbonaro said.
Siskiyou County was also battling the Tennant fire, which began Monday evening and by Tuesday evening had grown to 6,000 acres and was 0% contained, according to Kimberly DeVall, a spokesperson for the U.S. Forest Service.
About 3 p.m., the fire prompted evacuations for the area east of Highway 97 to East Ball Mountain Road, as well as from Old State Highway to Bray. Orders were later expanded to include Bray, the area south of MacDoel, the residents along Old State Highway and Juanita Lake. An evacuation center was established at Dorris City Hall.
Many parts of the Pacific Northwest remained underexcessive heat warningsTuesday, according to the National Weather Service.
Meanwhile, crews have gained some control over fires in Kern, San Bernardino and Monterey counties, as well as a brush fire that ignited in Hemet on Monday afternoon.
Two of the fires — the Shell fire in Kern County and the Peak fire in San Bernardino — have been linked to vehicle fires.
The Shell fire began Sunday after a car caught fire on the shoulder of a road, Kern County Fire Department spokesperson Andrew Freeborn said. The cause of the vehicle fire remains under investigation.
By Tuesday morning, the Shell fire hadneared 2,000 acresbut was 65% contained, according to the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection. Containment grew to 75% in the evening.
Politics
Facing his first wildfire season as president, Biden will discuss federal preparedness Wednesday with his Cabinet and Western governors, including Gavin Newsom.
The Peak fire was also caused by a “single vehicle accident,” San Bernardino National Forest officials said onTwitter. In that instance, the car fire quickly spread to nearby vegetation.
The fire reached about 35 acres Monday before  its progress was stopped about 2 p.m., forest officials said.
About an hour later, a vegetation fire ignited in Hemet.
Dubbed the Stowe fire, it grew to 122 acres by 5 p.m. before the spread was stopped, the Riverside County Fire Department said.
The fire damaged several power lines, spurring an outage for as many as 3,000 residents in east Hemet. Southern California Edison restored power to most residents by 5:30 p.m., officials said.
The Stowe fire was 100% contained by 8 a.m. Tuesday, Cal Fire said onTwitter.
The cause of that fire has not yet been determined.
California
Monsoon storms Tuesday through Thursday could bring dangerous lightning strikes, which have the potential to start fires amid hot, bone-dry conditions.
TheWillow firein Los Padres National Forest ignited June 18. As of Tuesday morning, it was holding steady at 2,877 acres and 87% containment, U.S. Forest Service spokeswoman Lynn Olson said.
Olson said the fire outbreaks will probably  repeat in the months to come.
“We’re anticipating a very busy season, unfortunately,” she said, pleading with the state’s residents to “recreate carefully” and avoid starting campfires or using fireworks where they’re not appropriate.
“Extreme caution is encouraged,” she added.

California wildfires spread amid record heat,https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2021-06-28/shell-fire-lava-fire-swell-as-california-record-heat-surges,2021-06-29,"As the West contends withsweltering conditionsand record-breaking heat, firefighters on Monday were battling three large wildfires in Kern, Siskiyou and San Bernardino counties.
By Monday afternoon, 8,000 to 10,000 residents were under evacuation orders for the Lava fire, according to Siskiyou County Sheriff Jeremiah LaRue. The fire was sparked by lightning Saturday morning in the Shasta-Trinity National Forest in Siskiyou County near the Oregon border.
It was “very active” overnight, Shasta-Trinity National Forest spokeswoman Suzi Johnson said, and had mushroomed to 1,446 acres with 20% containment by Monday morning.
Oregon and other parts of the Pacific Northwest are experiencing anunprecedented heat wave, with temperatures soaring into the triple digits again on Monday, according to theNational Weather Service. A red flag warning advising of gusty winds and low relative humidity wasissued in Siskiyou County.
“The temperatures have been an extreme challenge, and today is going to be a challenging day as well,” Johnson said Monday morning.
Lava fire crews were contending with treacherous conditions as they worked to contain the flames. The terrain is rocky, with limited road access, so firefighters must  walk up to the fire line, Johnson said. There are limited water resources close to the blaze.
Evacuation warningsfor Angel Valley Road, Carrick Addition and Solus Drive along State Route 97 north of Weed remained in effect Monday, she said.
By early afternoon, evacuation orders were issued for those living on the north side of Hoy Road, north along Highway 97 to County Road A12, and the communities of Lake Shastina and Juniper Valley off Big Springs Road, from Highway 97 to McDonald Lane, on both the east and west sides of Big Springs Road, theSiskiyou County Sheriff’s Departmenttweeted.
Evacuation orders were later expanded for the Mount Shasta Vista subdivision, both sides of County Road A12 and Harry Cash Road.
Late Monday afternoon, the fire had jumped Highway 97, which was closed between the city of Weed and Juniper Lodge, a roughly 30-mile stretch.
TheShell fire began in Kern Countyabout 1 p.m. Sunday and quickly ballooned in size, officials said.
By Monday evening, the fire had reached more than 1,900 acres, according to the Kern County Fire Department. Containment was at 50%.
The blaze was sparked by a vehicle fire that ignited surrounding vegetation, Freeborn said.
More than 200 personnel were attacking the fire from the air and the ground Monday, with more resources on the way. The U.S. Forest Service, the state Bureau of Land Management and the Ventura County Fire Department were all responding to the blaze, officialssaid on Twitter.
And in San Bernardino County, a fast-moving blaze on Old Waterman Canyon Road closed Highway 18 from Highway 138 to 40th Street late Monday morning, according to a San Bernardino National Foresttweet. Residents were advised to avoid Waterman Canyon.
The vegetation fire was reported on emergency-monitoring app PulsePoint about 10:49 a.m. By about 1 p.m., the newly named Peak fire had tripled from about 10 acres to 34 acres, according to the San Bernardino National Forest officials.
San Bernardino County firefighters were helping battle the blaze, and forest officials said about 2 p.m. the forward rate of spread had been stopped.

Newsom issues emergency proclamation to free up extra sources of power,https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2021-07-31/newsom-issues-emergency-proclamation-to-free-up-extra-sources-of-power,2021-08-01,"With energy resources looking exceedingly tight amid a persistently hot summer that has seen a spate of wildfires burn across the West, Gov. Gavin Newsom issuedan emergency proclamationFriday to free up additional megawatts of power to help make sure the state’s lights stay on in the coming months.
“I find that conditions of extreme peril to the safety of persons and property exist throughout California due to the combined effects of drought, wildfire and extreme heat on the state’s energy system,” Newsom said in the 11-page order.
The proclamation suspends certain permitting requirements, temporarily lifts some regulations and creates incentives so large energy users can move to backup power generation — all in an effort to add capacity or reduce load on the state’s electric grid through October.
One intriguing item in the proclamation calls for the state to reimburse utilities for payments made to industrial customers who agree to reduce their energy consumption when the grid is stressed.
Specifics of the plan still appeared to need firming up but Newsom’s order said “utilities must pay participating customers” as much as $2 per kilowatt-hour when they conserve. The state’s Department of Finance will provide the funding.
Edward Randolph, deputy executive director for energy and climate policy at California Public Utilities Commission, said the program is being developed through the governor’s office.
“This particular program is going to be limited to larger industrial customers who have larger load they could potentially reduce,” Randolph said. “It is intended to augment existing programs.”
The proclamation also included:
“Our first attempt will always be to deploy clean energy,” Public Utilities Commission President Marybel Batjer told reporters during a conference call. “There will be some backup energy that will be from fossil fuels that [will be] used in very intermittent, very extreme and very rare occasions but the tools will be in the toolbox for us to deploy.”
To help offset the extra greenhouse gas emissions, the governor’s proclamation directs the California Air Resources Board to come up with a plan by November to improve air quality in affected communities, especially those in economically disadvantaged areas.
“We’ll be setting up a mitigation program and new funds will be made available above and beyond our existing air quality funding that will mitigate those impacts,” saidLiane Randolph, chair of the Air Resources Board.
Newsom’s proclamation referenced California facing “an immediate shortfall of up to 3,500 megawatts during extreme weather events” now projected for this summer, after a workshop conducted by state energy officials wrapped up last month.
Newsom also alluded to a “previously unforeseen shortfall of up to 5,000 megawatts” that is projected for the summer of 2022, given the likelihood that the state’s severe drought conditions, heatwaves and wildfires won’t let up.
“What this proclamation does is really provide a motivational tool to just have that certainty so we can really bring that 3,500 (megawatts of power to the grid) under those extreme conditions,” saidCalifornia Energy Commission member Siva Gunda.
Earlier this year,Elliott Mainzer, president of the California Independent System Operator, which manages the grid for about 80 percent of the state and a portion of Nevada, said he wasguardedly optimisticthat utility customers would not experience rotating power outages.
“But over the course of the past three months, as we’ve experienced worsening drought conditions and declining hydro production, unprecedented heat throughout the West and increasingly dangerous wildfires impacting key transmission lines, it’s become clear that we’ve entered a new normal and extraordinary action is required,” Mainzer said.
In August 2020, a stubborn “heat dome” covered California for days and extended into neighboring states, leading to the first rolling blackouts in the Golden State in nearly 20 years.
This summer is off to a sizzling start, with temperatures across the West, including the coast of the Pacific Northwest, reaching record highs.
On July 12, the Bootleg Fire in Oregon in early Julytripped a major transmission linethat carries imported electricity from the Pacific Northwest into California.
The Dixie Fire in Northern California is still raging, having blistered240,595 acres as of Friday, according to the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection.

Crews battle Hungry fire in northern Los Angeles County,https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2021-07-31/hungry-fire-northern-los-angeles-county,2021-08-01,"Crews on Saturday were fighting a fast-moving wildfire in northern Los Angeles County dubbed the Hungry fire, county and state fire officials said.
As of 7:20 p.m., the fire in Gorman had burned about 340 acres and was 30% contained, according to the Los Angeles County Fire Department. The fire’s forward progress had been halted, the department said.
Hours earlier, the fire department said the fire, near the area of 36000 Quill Lake Rd.,  did not pose an immediate threat to any structures.
Officials at the Hungry Valley State Vehicular Recreation Area, located in the Tejon Pass, evacuated and closed the park due to the fire.
The warm, dry and windy conditions fueled  the rapid growth of the fire, the the National Weather Service said.
Three helicopters with Los Angeles County Fire Air Operations Section also helped battle the fire from the air.
The cause of the fire is unknown.

"For parents of unvaccinated kids, worsening Delta variant brings alarm, questions",https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2021-07-31/what-the-delta-variant-development-means-for-unvaccinated-kids,2021-08-01,"New evidence about the Delta variant’s ability to infect and spread even among those who are fully vaccinated has been particularly alarming for parents of young children who are still not eligible for the COVID-19 vaccine.
Many parents who thought their children faced limited risks of getting the coronavirus are now reassessing their  stance. Health experts said parents should be extra careful with the highly contagious variant, which iscausing rising infection numbersin Los Angeles County and many other parts of the country.
But several also stressed that it’s important to keep the risks in context,  adding that children could still go back to school with proper precautions.
“Children need to be in school,” said Julie Swann, a health systems engineer at North Carolina State University. “Those of us who have experienced last year, we know it.”
Dr. Katherine Williamson, a pediatrician in Orange County, said she has seen an increase in coronavirus cases among young patients in recent weeks, as well as an uptick in parents who are vaccinating eligible children — both of which she attributed to the rise of the Delta variant.
“Parents should be making sure that they’re doing everything they can to keep their kids safe when they have an unvaccinated child in their family,” Williamson said.
Yet the risk of severe illnessremains low for those who are vaccinatedagainst COVID-19, and the rates of infections, hospitalizations and deaths are much higher for those without the shots.
With the right guidelines and increased vaccinations among those who are eligible, Williamson said, it is still possible to keep young people protected.
“Kids are only as safe as who they are around,” she said.
Science & Medicine
The Delta variant is more formidable than previously believed, due to its ability to infect and be spread by people who are vaccinated, a CDC document says.
Though the Delta variant was already known to be more transmissible than the original coronavirus, a new report onan outbreak involving 469 people in Massachusettsfound that 74% of infections were among people who were fully vaccinated. Anda confidential reportproduced by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention pulled together other vexing signs that the variant spreads more easily among fully vaccinated people than previously thought.
Children younger than 12 are not yet eligible for the COVID-19 vaccine, and those ages  12 to 17 are still lagging when it comes to obtaining the shots.
The rise of the Delta variant has spurred a rash of changes in recent weeks, from newtesting and vaccination requirementsfor federal, city and state employees to the revival ofpreviously abandoned mask guidelines.
West Hollywood resident Jonathan  Strauss has two children, ages 5 and 2, and said he is “very OK with indoor mask requirements coming back.”
The family recently encountered a vaccinated, unmasked man at an ice cream shop who told them he had no idea that there’s no vaccine available yet for  children younger than 12.
“My top thing to reinforce to others is that there are still many members of our community who cannot be vaccinated either because of age or health reasons, and that they can theoretically be infected by vaccinated people,” said Strauss, 41.
Despite the risk, he and his wife are hoping that rising case counts in L.A. County won’t preclude schools from opening in the fall — so long as the schools remain diligent about masking, testing and other safety procedures.
On Thursday, the Los Angeles Unified School District announced that all students and employees will berequired to take weekly coronavirus tests, whether they are vaccinated or not.
Many health experts said moving forward with school reopening plans still makes sense.
Swann recently published areportthat found that in a worst-case scenario, without masking in schools, an additional 70% of children could be infected with the coronavirus within three months. Her research also shows that even if masking is required in all schools, if there are no other mitigation strategies, she still expects 40% of elementary school students to be infected within three months.
However, there are factors that can affect these numbers, Swann said.
For example, when 50% of kids come to school with protection from the virus — either from vaccines (in middle school or high school) or from a prior infection — the model projects up to 25% of the other kids will be infected, if everyone is masked.
In a school that implements both masking and weekly testing — like those in Los Angeles Unified — Swann’s model shows that 20% of students are likely to be infected.
Even with that knowledge, she said, schools should reopen for the 2021-22 academic year, with additional mitigation strategies in place.
“Schools and counties and states can also increase testing of their population and the community, which will also help slow the disease spread,” she said.
California
Public health experts are hoping L.A. County’s reinstated requirement that people wear masks in indoor public places can help slow the spread.
As the Delta variant spreads, public health officials are continuing to keep a close eye on vaccination numbers, which remain woefully low among young people.
“It’s crystal clear that vaccination rates among younger people across the board in L.A. County are much lower than they are for older people, and with more opportunities for intermingling,” L.A. County Public Health Director Barbara Ferrer said during a news briefing Thursday.
The largest gap remains not only among young people but also among some young people of color.
Only 24% of Black people and 33% of Latino people ages 12 to 15 had received at least one shot, according to data Ferrer presented, compared with 50% of white people and 76% of Asian people in that age group.
In total, about 50% of teens in L.A. County ages 12 to 17 have received at least one dose of the vaccine, Ferrer said, compared with about 70% of county residents overall.
There are signs that the coronavirus surge is stabilizing, Ferrer said, noting that the testing positivity rate is starting to level off. But the 5.17% positivity rate is still far higher than it was June 15, when it was below 1%.
“We still have close to 4 million residents across the county not yet vaccinated,” Ferrer said. “This risk of increased spread from this variant within our county remains high.”
California
L.A. will require city employees to provide proof of vaccination against COVID-19 or undergo weekly testing for the virus.
Not every parent is eager to send their kids back to school.
Deborah Poppink, 57, of Mar Vista said one of her kids prefers learning at home, while the other is looking forward to returning to theater class but unsure of how it will work with masks.
Poppink, who previously worked as an L.A. Unified teacher, is also frustrated with the district’s new weekly testing mandate, which she said is essentially asking vaccinated families to carry the weight of the unvaccinated.
“If everyone was vaccinated [there] would be no need for weekly tests,” she said. She also noted there is still a lack of guidance around when and where testing will be done and how school-related activities like carpool rides, sports and parents visiting campuses will fit in.
“This is a public health crisis, and I imagine it’s going to get worse rather than better,” she said. “Kids are not going to keep their masks on all day long. Even in regular times, kids like to sneak to the bathroom to vape or just do what kids do.”
Her daughter, Delilah, 16, said she is less concerned for herself than for fellow students who haven’t been vaccinated.
“There’s no way to know who’s been vaccinated,” she said, “so we have no way to protect the unvaccinated kids.”
California
Unvaccinated Angelenos continue to be infected with the coronavirus and fall seriously ill at significantly higher rates than their vaccinated counterparts — further evidence of the protective power the shots provide
Pediatricians remain concerned about the spread of the Delta variant, with Williamson noting that parents should avoid socializing with unvaccinated people, including family members, “because then they can bring that virus home to their children.”
Dr. Gregory Poland, a Mayo Clinic immunologist in Rochester, Minn., said continuing outbreaks are probably inevitable.
With unvaccinated kids preparing to once again huddle in classrooms and on buses, a surge in infections linked to school reopenings “can’tnothappen,” he said.
But most experts also agreed that a “safe and sane” approach to COVID-19 protocols — along withmore adults doing their part to get vaccinated— should at least eliminate some of the risk.
“If you weigh the risks and the benefits … I think it’s worth sending kids to school as long as there are mitigation measures in place,” said Dr. Eric Ball, a pediatrician at Children’s Health of Orange County Primary Care Network.
Science & Medicine
By now, we all know that the Delta variant is about twice as transmissible as the original coronavirus. What exactly makes it so good at spreading?
Like Williamson, Ball has seen an uptick in coronavirus-positive patients in recent weeks, with the vast majority of infections among unvaccinated teenagers and children who are too young to be vaccinated. The cases are presenting in different ways, he said, from young children with cold-like symptoms to older kids who are getting “pretty sick.”
Feelings of fear and sadness that he experienced last year have given way to frustration, he said, since adults could have done more to prevent the current surge.
He also said that most of the teachers and adults in schools should be vaccinated and that nearly every student in middle and high school now has the opportunity to get a shot.
“So that really should be our push at this point,” Ball said. “To make sure we vaccinate as many people as possible to protect the kids who are too young to be vaccinated.”

Newsom asks Biden to ensure Pentagon OKs use of satellite data for wildfire program,https://www.latimes.com/politics/story/2021-07-30/newsom-asks-biden-to-ensure-pentagon-continues-to-provide-access-to-military-satellite-information,2021-07-30,"WASHINGTON —Gov. Gavin Newsom on Friday publicly asked President Biden to ensure California can continue to access the Pentagon’s sensitive military satellite information as part of a program to help spot and track wildfires.
The two-year-old program, called FireGuard,relies on access to the military’s infrared satellites that regularly scan the U.S. skies for enemy missiles. The satellite images are shared with firefighters, who can use them to make on-the-ground decisions about evacuations and controlling blazes.
Under an existing military agreement regarding the classified information, access to the satellite information is due to expire Sept. 30.
While the program’s leader told the Los Angeles Times in July that he expects another short-term extension, there has been no word from the Pentagon. Newsom and other California officials are seekingpermanent access to the data.
“We’re getting [approval] on a year-to-year basis, but it’s hard. Every year, we fight to get a one-year extension on that access to a critical tool of technology,” Newsom told Biden during a virtual meeting between administration officials and governors of wildfire-prone states.
Newsom stressed that he thought Biden would approve of the program.
“I’d encourage you to help us so we’re not just fighting every year for something that I think you would support and the Pentagon, at the end of the day, final analysis will approve,” the governor added.
Biden pledged to take up the issue.
“When this meeting is over, I will be on the phone with the Department of Defense and talking about the access to satellite capability,” the president said.
The program, which began as a pilot, is little known. but firefighters told The Times that they have quickly come to rely on it.
Newsom called FireGuard’s data “a game changer for us.”

"Dixie fire swells beyond 240,000 acres, swallowing homes: ‘It’s been heartbreaking’",https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2021-07-30/la-me-dixie-fire-swells-past-240000-acres-destroys-homes,2021-07-30,"Lauren Redmore and her husband moved from Texas to the pretty  Plumas County town of Taylorsville — population 198 or so — in January.
Just six months later, she and her husband became wildfire refugees, having fled their home last week as the massive Dixie fire burned ever closer.
Redmore, a social scientist who moved to Northern California to work for a nonprofit focused on rural development and forestry, never expected to be confronted with fire so soon. Waiting for updates on the fate of her new home has been tough.
“We have gone through a really difficult time emotionally,” said Redmore, 37, who is staying with friends in Corvallis, Ore. “It’s been hard to stop myself from constantly checking the fire map.”
The Dixie fire is now thestate’s 11th largest wildfire in recorded historyafter growing roughly 20,000 acres in about 24 hours. The fire jumped from the No. 13 spot overnight Thursday.
Now burning into its third week, the massive wildfire has seared 240,595 acres in several counties north of Sacramento, according to theCalifornia Department of Forestry and Fire Protection. Containment was 24% as of Friday, inching up 1 percentage point from where it was for several days.
Redmore is a rare newcomer to Plumas County, where the population has long been shrinking. It is comprised mostly of tiny, unincorporated Gold Rush communities nestled among the pine forests, and it is a place where people tend to look out for their far-flung neighbors. Seeing the people of Taylorsville band together as the Dixie fire burns has been heartening, Redmore said, but the fact that devastating blazes are the new normal for so many Californians has been hard to swallow.
“It’s been heartbreaking, my own personal grief for a place I barely know, and the collective climate grief that my younger colleagues know lies ahead for all of us,” Redmore said. “I can’t imagine what it would be like to raise a kid knowing this is their future.”
At least 42 major structures were destroyed in the fire’s wake, according to Cal Fire. More than 20 minor structures have also gone up in flames. Those numbers will likely grow because damage assessment teams have not been able to go into many areas where the fire threat is still too high to send crews, said Capt. Mitch Matlow, a spokesperson with the multiagency team managing the fire.
Mandatory evacuationsacross large portions of Butte, Plumas and Tehama counties have left scores displaced, and residents in nearby Lassen County are on high alert.
As of Thursday, three shelters for Plumas County evacuees housed 75 displaced residents, including 17 sheltering outside the facility primarily because “they want to remain with their pets,” which are not allowed inside, Plumas County Sheriff’s Deputy Chandler Peay said duringan incident update.
Much of the Dixie fire’s destruction has been centered in the Indian Valley area, which has multiple reports of family homes reduced to rubble.
Much of the West has been plagued by extreme heat and drought due to theworsening climate crisis, which is drying vegetation and feeding massive fires earlier in the year. As of Thursday,82 large fireshave burned nearly 1.7 million acres across 13 states, according to the National Interagency Fire Center.
More than 6,000 personnel are battling the Dixie fire, and there’s cautious optimism among fire officials that the crews are making progress.
The fire’s growth from Thursday into Friday was modest and partially due to controlled burns, Matlow said, explaining that “one of the tools that we use to fight the fire is fire itself.”
But there are fears that a weather system moving in  Friday will bring erratic winds and lighting — two ingredients that can fuel the fire and ignite new ones, he said.
On Friday morning, a base camp in Chico was consumed by smoke and a stable air mass hung over the fire. As the day heats up and the weather front strengthens, that air mass is expected to become unstable.
Winds could become unpredictable, with updrafts threatening to create a dramaticpyrocumulonimbus cloudabove the blaze. Outflow winds hit the ground and travel through drainages. Erratic winds can cause erratic fire, Matlow said, “because the fire goes where the wind pushes.”

Essential California: The shifting L.A. landscape for COVID-19,https://www.latimes.com/california/newsletter/2021-07-30/essential-california-july-30-2021-essential-california,2021-07-30,"Good morning, and welcome to the Essential Californianewsletter. It’sFriday, July 30. I’m Michael Finnegan.
The communities driving Los Angeles County’s latest surge in coronavirus cases might surprise you: Beverly Hills, West Hollywood, the Hollywood Hills, Studio City and Venice.
Young adults are the ones causing the most spread of the virus this time around, and some outbreaks have occurred at bars and restaurants, according to Barbara Ferrer, the county’s public health director.
In previous surges, the hardest-hit neighborhoods were lower income and more densely populated: East L.A., South L.A., the northeast San Fernando Valley. Essential workers were getting COVID-19 on the job and spreading it at home.
My colleague Luke Moneysurveys the shifting landscapeof coronavirus infection in Southern California. More than 53% of the county’s residents are vaccinated. It’s now those who remain unvaccinated who face the biggest threat of serious illness and death, health officials say.
“This is turning into the pandemic of the unvaccinated,” said Dr. Wilma Wooten, Ferrer’s counterpart in San Diego County.
Even with “breakthrough” infections of the vaccinated with the highly contagious Delta variant, those who are unvaccinated remain far more vulnerable. Out of the 504 people who died from COVID-19 from April 1 to June 30 in L.A. County, 96% were either unvaccinated or had not completed their inoculation regimen, Money reports.
The disturbing resurgence led the Los Angeles Unified School District to announce Thursday that it will require all students and district employees returning to in-person activities to undergo “baseline and ongoing weekly COVID-testing,” regardless of vaccination status,my colleague Howard Blume reports.
In San Francisco, where coronavirus cases are also on the rise again, Mayor London Breed said the city was considering an indoor mask mandate for everyone, regardless of vaccination status — like the one in L.A. County. Breed said those choosing not to be vaccinated were affecting the economy and health of everyone else, theSan Francisco Chronicle reported.
Mask mandates, regardless of vaccination status, are also coming to Disneyland, Universal Studios Hollywood and other theme parks, according to The Times’Hugo Martín. Disneyland’s face-covering rule takes effect Friday for all guests 2 years old and older while indoors.
The growing COVID-19 threat has led public and private employers nationwide to start limiting the ability of the unvaccinated to infect their co-workers, a crackdown that was applauded by The Times’ editorial board, an opinion outlet that is separate from the newsroom.
“Hooray,”the editorialsaid. “It’s time the stubbornly unvaccinated are held to account for their part in the resurgence of COVID-19.”
And now,here’s what’s happening across California.

The Dixie fire, still raging in Northern California, has destroyed dozens of structures.Even as crews struggle to douse the flames, the fire has burned down 40 structures and threatens nearly 11,000 more, according to the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection. It covers an area larger than New York City, and it’s now the 13th largest wildfire in the state’s recorded history, Hayley Smith reports.Los Angeles Times
The shortage of seats for qualified students at most University of California campuses has worsened.UC admitted 132,353 freshman applicants for this fall, an 11% increase over last year. But more than 71,000 were denied admission, including nearly 44,000 Californians, the overwhelming majority of them apparently eligible if there had been space. Admission rates for California applicants fell from a systemwide average of 70.5% last year to 65.7%. In 1995, it was 83.5%.Los Angeles Times
Black and Latino firefighters in Los Angeles are calling for a federal investigationof allegedly widespread racial bias in the city’s Fire Department. Leaders of Los Bomberos and the Stentorians, groups of Latino and Black firefighters respectively, demanded the inquiry by the U.S. attorney’s office following areport this weekby The Times’ Paul Pringle on allegations that a high-ranking white official got preferential treatment after he was reported to be under the influence of alcohol or drugs while on duty at LAFD headquarters. In a letter to acting U.S. Atty. Tracy Wilkison,  Assistant Chief Patrick Butler, the president of Los Bomberos, said the case of Chief Deputy Fred Mathis “is just one of many examples that we have come to know, which demonstrates a pattern and practice of corruption and potential violations of civil rights.”Los Angeles Times

The Sept. 14 special election on the proposed recall of Gov. Gavin Newsomis less than seven weeks away. Many Californians are not looking forward to it. In fact, 69% of the state’s likely voters say the election is a waste of money, a newPublic Policy Institute of California surveyfound. California voters still enjoy having the power to boot their elected officials in recalls; they just don’t think this one is a good idea, Mark Baldassare, the institute’s president and chief executive,writesof the poll’s findings. Baldassare said Newsom was well positioned to survive the vote with his strong public approval ratings, especially among the Democrats who dominate California. But as Julia Wick and Phil Willon reported, the big question is whether Democrats will bother to vote.Los Angeles Times

Shasta County D.A. considers PG&E ‘criminally liable’ for deadly Zogg fire; no charges filed yet,https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2021-07-29/shasta-county-d-a-considers-pg-e-criminally-liable-for-deadly-zogg-fire-no-charges-filed-yet,2021-07-30,"Shasta County’s top prosecutor has decided Pacific Gas & Electric is “criminally liable” for its role in sparking the Zogg fire, which killed four people, destroyed more than 200 homes and burned 56,000 acres last year.
Dist. Atty. Stephanie Bridgett, whose office has been scrutinizing PG&E’s role in the devastating blaze, said Thursday her office has not decided the “nature or the grade” of whatever charges may be brought against the beleaguered utility. Bridgett said she would make a decision before the anniversary of the Zogg fire, which erupted in late September 2020.
The announcement that a district attorney considered PG&E criminally liable in a deadly blaze — a statement that carries serious implications — was announced in a brief Facebook post and left many questions unanswered, chief among them what charges the utility might face. Sonoma County prosecutors brought felony and misdemeanor charges against PG&E for its role in a 2019 fire that burned a similarly broad swath of land but did not kill anyone.
A spokeswoman for the Shasta County district attorney’s office didn’t immediately return a request for comment.
In a statement, a PG&E spokesperson said the utility had already resolved civil claims with Shasta County and was continuing to negotiate settlements with individual victims of the Zogg fire “in an effort to make it right.”
“We do not, however, agree with the district attorney’s conclusion that criminal charges are warranted given the facts of this case,” the company spokesperson said.
PG&E has previously said it cooperated fully with an investigation by the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection  that found the Zogg fire was sparked by a pine tree falling on PG&E power lines north of Igo in Shasta County.
The troubled utility was driven into bankruptcy after incurring massive liabilities from wildfires that swept across Northern California in 2017 and 2018.It reorganized last year with the blessing of Gov. Gavin Newsom.
Sonoma County Dist. Atty. Jill Ravitch charged PG&E in April with five felony and 28 misdemeanor counts over its role in the Kincade fire, which badly injured six firefighters in 2019. Investigators determined that a PG&E line sparked the blaze, which raced across 77,000 acres, burned 374 buildings and prompted what authorities called the largest evacuation in state history.
PG&E accepted the finding that its line ignited the Kincade fire but has denied that it committed any crime.
Last year, PG&E’s then-chief executive, Bill Johnson, entered a guilty plea on behalf of the utility to 84 counts of involuntary manslaughter, admitting criminal liability in the Camp fire, which killed 84 people and destroyed more than 18,000 buildings in Paradise.
PG&E admitted its poorly maintained equipment sparked the fire and agreed to pay a $3.5-million fine and an additional $500,000 penalty to the Butte County district attorney’s office to recoup the costs of investigating the blaze. Under a plea agreement, no executives at the utility were personally punished.

Portland bans homeless camps in forest areas amid Oregon wildfires,https://www.latimes.com/world-nation/story/2021-07-29/portland-bans-homeless-camps-in-forest-areas-amid-oregon-wildfires,2021-07-29,"PORTLAND, Ore. —Portland, Ore., has banned homeless people from camping in forested parks to protect them from potential wildfires and prevent them from accidentally starting blazes during a summer of drought andrecord-breaking heat.
The City Council adopted the rule Wednesday for “high-risk hazard zones,” including in and around Portland’s famous Forest Park and in heavily forested wetlands and natural areas around the city. The ban will apply during wildfire season or whenever a county burn ban is in effect. The 8-square-mile Forest Park in the heart of Portland is one of the largest urban forests in the U.S.
There have been frequent reports of fires at unsanctioned campsites and at clusters of RVs around the city from illegal burning, the Oregonian/OregonLivereported.
The city stressed that the rule was to prevent fires from starting in the city but also to protect homeless people from blazes started by others near encampments.
Nonprofit groups working with the city will visit the camps, provide information about fire risk and help residents relocate voluntarily before any aggressive sweeps take place, the newspaper said.
“I do not like sweeps, and I do not like that we have a shortage of housing that people can afford to live in,” Commissioner Jo Ann Hardesty said. “But I cannot stand by and do nothing as people are at risk of dying by fire.”
World & Nation
Detailed maps of high-risk areas prepared by the city’s fire marshal will help campers know where they can’t live, said Kaia Sand, director of Street Roots, a weekly alternative newspaper and advocacy group for people experiencing homelessness. But she said the solution is “half baked” unless the city also provides safe places for displaced residents to go.
“The fact that our city removes people without good alternatives for them to live has always been a problem and continues to be a problem,” she said.
A historic drought and recent heat waves tied to climate change have made wildfires harder to fight in the American West. Scientists say climate change has made the region much warmer and drier in the last 30 years and will continue to make weather more extreme and wildfires more frequent and destructive.

More than 40 structures burn and thousands more are threatened as Dixie fire keeps growing,https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2021-07-29/40-structures-burned-thousands-threatened-dixie-fire,2021-07-29,"A growing number of homes and structures have been destroyed by the Dixie fire, which on Thursday continued to swell as crews struggled to gain a foothold on the flames.
More than 40 structures have burned in themonstrous fire, and another 10,700 remain under threat, according to the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection. At least 20 minor structures, such as outbuildings and sheds, have also gone up in flames.
At 221,504 acres, the multi-county fire is now the13th largest wildfirein the state’s recorded history, according to Cal Fire, up from the No. 15 spot just days ago. It is burning an area larger than New York City.
For the third day in a row, the Dixie fire remains only 23% contained.
“It’s kind of hard to wrap our heads ... around a 220,000-acre fire,” Plumas National Forest Supervisor Chris Carlton said during an incident update Wednesday evening, noting that the fire’s perimeter was more than 80 miles. “That’s a lot of fire out there.”
California
The conditions that paved the way for the Dixie fire’s growth are becoming more common.
Crews on Thursday are focused on laying containment lines and defending nearby communities, officials said, while up against increasingly challenging conditions.
Temperatures are expected to climb to the mid-80s in the coming days, and humidity levels are rapidly dropping, according to the National Weather Service.
Fire behavior analyst John Cook said the forecasted hot, dry weather indicated a likely increase in fire activity.
“We’re dealing with verycritical fuel conditionsright now — the fuels are much drier than they would be normally this time of year,” Cook said. “And when they’re dry, they’re much harder to contain.”
Much of the West has been plagued by extreme heat and drought due to theworsening climate crisis, which is drying vegetation and feeding massive fires earlier in the year. To date,82 large fireshave burned nearly 1.7 million acres across 13 states, the National Interagency Fire Center said.
California
Already this year, there have been more than twice as many acres burned than during the same period last year — and hundreds more fires.
Cal Fire Butte County spokesman Rick Carhart said the changing weather conditions would likely lead to the formation of another largepyrocumulonimbus cloudover the fire Thursday.
The vertically growing clouds are unstable and intensely hot and can generate strong gusts of wind that send sparks flying. Already, multiple spot fires have been ignited by Dixie’s wind-whipped embers.
The volatile clouds also can create their own lightning, which has the potential to spark more flames. But Carhart said officials did not want residents to panic if they saw a massive cloud forming.
“That’s just the fire continuing to consume itself within the interior of the fire,” he said.

A wildfire photographer captured the Martian pall in the Plumas County towns of Greenville and Twain over the weekend and said it was the darkest smoke-tainted sky he’d ever seen.
The Dixie fire has spurredmandatory evacuationsacross large portions of Butte, Plumas and Tehama counties, with nearby Lassen County placing residents on high alert.
Those who remain are threatened not only by flames but alsothick, noxious smoke. Cook noted that smoke generated by the fire was working its way down into surrounding valleys.
Smoke from Western fires — including the Dixie fire and the 413,000-acreBootleg firein Oregon — has already traveledas far as the East Coast.
In Paradise, near the Dixie fire’s southern edge, air quality was hovering at the extremely toxic level of 874 on Thursday morning, according to EPA air monitoring siteAirNow.
Experts say people near wildfire smoke shouldstay insidewith their doors and windows shut.
California
As wildfires ravage hundreds of thousands of acres across California, more is being learned about the damaging effects of their smoke.
Wildfire photographer Josh Edelson, who has been taking pictures of the Dixie fire,said this weekthat it was one of the darkest fires he had ever seen.
“It was hard to even capture in a photo,” he said. “At 4 in the afternoon, it was like it was midnight.”
Edelson described ash flakes the size of dimes and a smoke smell so powerful it was “like sticking your head right into a campfire.”
More than 5,900 firefighters are now battling the Dixie fire, officials said.
The task at hand is enormous, and residents hoping to return to their lives and homes will have little choice but to wait.
“I recognize the fact that we need to get folks back to their houses,” Plumas County Sheriff Todd Johns said. “But I will ask that you give me a little bit of patience.”

How to keep the air in your home clean when there’s wildfire smoke outside,https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2021-08-31/indoor-air-quality-how-to-protect-against-wildfire-smoke,2021-09-01,"Severalwildfiresare burning in Northern California, including theCaldor firethat prompted amandatory evacuationof South Lake Tahoe and nearby communities this week.National forests are closedthroughout the state, including Southern California’s popular Angeles National Forest.
If you live in the area or anyplace else where wildfires are burning in California, you might notice hazy skies, the smell of smoke and ash collecting on your car windshield. Those are signs that the air quality has become harmful, especially for sensitive groups (including young people with developing lungs, people older than 65 and those with lung conditions).
When the air is that bad, Carrie Nyseen, senior director of advocacy for theAmerican Lung Assn., suggests you stay indoors.
Wildfire smoke doesn’t just stay in the area where the wildfire is happening because “smoke doesn’t know boundaries.” That’s why she suggests having a plan of action to stay indoors, create a clean air space in your home andhave an evacuation planready in the event local officials mandate one.
Wildfires are expectedin California’s dry summer and fall seasons. But Jo Kay Ghosh, health effects officer for the South Coast Air Quality Management District, said wildfires — and the resulting smoke —are now possible any time of year.
Air inspection:Learnhow to check the air qualityin your area.
“If you know there’s a wildfire nearby or you think there might be wildfire smoke nearby, the  No. 1 thing to do is check the air quality,” Ghosh said.
During a wildfire, checking the air quality is important because weather conditions, particularly wind, can change the distribution of wildfire smoke.
Home improvement:Seal any leaks, cracks or holes where smoke can come in. Investing in multipaned windows and weather stripping around doorways can keep the smoke and ash out of your home.
Prepare supplies:Ghosh said to be prepared to shelter in your home, especially when the air is poor. Have items in your home that will support you and your family for a few days, including:
Health conditions:If you or a loved one has a heart or lung condition, talk to your doctor about what to do to protect yourself. If you have asthma, make sure you have an asthma action plan. The Environmental Protection Agency suggests having a writtenasthma action planthat encourages self-management of asthma. You should have a list of triggers and how to avoid them; instructions for medication; information on what to do during an asthma episode; and emergency telephone numbers including which doctor to call.
Nyseen, of the American Lung Assn., said it’s especially challenging for Californians to stay indoors “because of the beautiful weather.”
“So thinking there are days when you shouldn’t go outdoors is not easy,” she said. However, when the air is hazardous, you should stay inside as much as possible.
Do:Close the doors and windows. Place damp rags at the bottoms of doors or windows that could let in outside air.
Do:Dust or mop surfaces with a damp cloth,the EPA says, to keep settled particles from getting back into the air.
Do:Stay cool by running fans or your central air conditioning. If your HVAC system or window air conditioner has a fresh-air option (that is, it pulls air from outside), turn it off and close the intake, or set the system to recirculate.
Do:Create a clean air space, Nyseen recommends. This is an interior room where you can completely shut all doors and windows and run a HEPA air purifier. A HEPA purifier moves air through its filter to trap particles, odors and more without introducing anything into the air. She said these purifiers clean a certain amount of square-footage, though, so when buying a purifier, make sure it can clean the air in the room you’ve chosen. Don’t use an ionizer air purifier in your clean air space, she said, because it can create ozone.
Don’t:Create smoke or bad air inside by smoking cigarettes, cigars or pipes; using gas, propane or wood-burning stoves or cookers; spraying aerosol products; frying or broiling food; burning candles or incense; and vacuuming, unless the vacuum has a HEPA filter.
Don’t:Go outside if you don’t have to. If you have to leave your home, wear an N95 mask if you have one; other face coverings are not as effective.
Don’t:If you made aDIY air purifier, do not leave it unattended.
Climate & Environment
If air purifiers are sold out or out of your budget, a simple air filter taped to a box fan can filter harmful particulate matter and keep it out of your lungs and bloodstream. Here’s what you need to know.
If there’s leftover ash and soot outside your home, it’s recommended that you wear gloves and an N95 mask while cleaning and disposing of it. The American Lung Assn. recommends that you wet the area to reduce the amount of particles becoming airborne.
Those with lung or heart problems should avoid clean-up activities.
Lifestyle
California’s wildfires have left many Southern California gardens dusted with ash. That coating can hurt the plant’s ability to soak in the sun, but a quick rinse with a hose will send the ash into the soil, where it can actually do some good.

‘We have been preparing for this’: Tahoe officials say they’re ready for wildfire,https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2021-08-31/officials-say-they-are-ready-for-wildfire-in-tahoe,2021-08-31,"Evacuation centers are at capacity. Large portions of Highway 50 are shut down.Thousands of residents have fled their homes.
But officials on the front lines of the the ragingCaldor fireinsist they are ready for what may come in the following days — even as the wind-whipped fire makes it way into the Lake Tahoe Basin.
“We have been preparing for this firefight in this area,” said Capt. Brian Newman of the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection. “We have been planning and preparing, and we’ve ordered resources to deal with the impact of the fire that came into Lake Tahoe.”
California
Thousands rushed to leave South Lake Tahoe as the resort city came under an evacuation order due to the Caldor fire.
Those plans include hundreds of California National Guard soldiers and U.S. Army personnel who have been deployed to battle the blaze. More than 3,000 firefighters from Cal Fire, the U.S. Forest Service and other  groups have already been assigned to the fire.
Forest Service officials on Monday alsoannounced the closureof all national forests in California to protect firefighters and prevent further conflagrations. The closures begins at 11:59 p.m. Tuesday, and ends at the same time Sept. 17.
California
A wildfire in South Lake Tahoe would not only threaten lives and homes; it would also move faster, burn hotter and be significantly harder to fight, experts say.
Although there aremore than a dozenlarge wildfires burning across the state, Cal Fire chief Thom Porter last week said the Caldor fire was the top firefighting priority in the nation.
“It is that important,” he said. “It is knocking on the door to the Lake Tahoe Basin.”
The fire had grown to more than 190,000 acres Tuesday, with nearly 500 structures burned and 33,000 threatened. It was 16% contained.
Strong winds helped fan the flames, with Newman reporting an “active fire front” near Echo Summit, not far from where the Sierra-at-Tahoe ski resort was reported to be in flames.
Winds also sent embers flying into the Tahoe Basin, and by Monday evening the fire had already made its way into Meyers and Christmas Valley, Newman said.
Cal Fire spokesman Chris Anthony said federal, state and local fire and law enforcement agencies “have been working diligently to prepare Tahoe for this exact scenario” since the Angora fire of 2007 — another wind-driven wildfire in El Dorado County that spurred evacuations and destroyed more than 200 homes.
“We knew it could happen, and we spent millions of dollars and thousands of hours on public education, evacuation planning, community meetings, defensible-space inspections, shipping programs, home-hardening outreach, fuels-reduction projects and prescribed fire and forest health projects,” he said.
California
The Caldor fire has also changed the view of fire risk in Lake Tahoe.
Yet the Caldor fire’s behavior has been anything but predictable. Only days ago, crews thought they had turned a corner on the fire — only to be met with strong winds and extreme dryness that forced those gains to slip away.
Porter said the Caldor fire and the nearby Dixie fire are the first to have burnedfrom one side of the Sierra to the other.
“Two times in our history and they’re both happening this month,” Porter said. “So we need to be really cognizant that there is fire activity happening in California that we have never seen before.”
Crystal Kolden, a fire scientist at UC Merced, noted that an “urban conflagration” in the South Lake Tahoe area would move faster, burn hotter and be significantly harder to fight than a wildland fire, as homes and other structures would provide additional fuel and produce “tremendous embers.”
“You’ve got this potential for it to really start jumping from building to building to building, and it’s just a completely different beast and they can’t fight it,” she said.
California
The Caldor fire is moving toward Nevada, prompting evacuations, while firefighters in the South Lake Tahoe area try to “herd” flames away from homes and structures.
Kolden said the likelihood of the fire moving into Tahoe was “feeling pretty inevitable” as crews were essentially moving into triage mode.
She noted that the fire’s significant smoke could make aerial operations difficult, and that there are thousands of structures in the lakeside area that would potentially need to be defended.
“I really hope that I’m wrong about this, and they get a lucky break with the weather,” she said.
“But right now, the weather does not really look like it’s cooperating, and this fire has so much energy that it’s going to be really tough to try to control it in what are some of the most challenging conditions you could possibly imagine.”

Letters to the Editor: South Lake Tahoe is on the brink. Now will politicians stop deferring to Big Oil?,https://www.latimes.com/opinion/story/2021-08-31/south-lake-tahoe-clador-fire-climate-change,2021-08-31,"To the editor:The words of Chief Thom Porter, director of the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection, should ring clear to those focused on the vulnerability of Lake Tahoe to wildfire. He said, “For the rest of you in California: Every acre can and will burn someday in this state.” (“As Caldor fire closes in on Lake Tahoe, crews scramble to prevent worst-case scenario,” Aug. 31)
Yes, decades of fire suppression, clear-cut logging and population growth in the urban-wildland interface have increased the danger from wildfires. But not to see the figurative forest for the trees in this situation is foolish.
Climate change has made the West warmer and drier will continue to make weather more extreme and wildfires more frequent and destructive beyond just our dense forests. If wildfires in places such as Lake Tahoe should teach us all anything, it is that true solutions are reached through politics and policymaking.
Both individuals and large businesses must step beyond the reactionary donations to impacted regions and put effort into climate lobbying. Policy solutions such as carbon taxes, regulations, ending subsidies and standards in renewable energy may threaten the fossil fuel industry’s status quo, but they would help slow the desiccation of the forests and other places we hold dear.
Dillon Osleger, Truckee, Calif.
..
To the editor:It is now death by a thousand cuts for the planet. The daily news consists of ceaseless fires, droughts, heat waves and floods.
I visited my sister in Minden, Nev., two weeks ago, just 20 miles from South Lake Tahoe. The Tamarack fire was still raging in nearby Alpine County, Calif. The air in Minden was a dystopian yellow, raining ashes. We huddled inside around an air filter, grieving the loss of one of my sister’s most cherished hiking trails.
What will be lost next? South Lake Tahoe? The iconic sequoia? What loss is too much for fossil fuel advocates, if any?
The rest of us are heartsick over the planet and the landmarks we loved, now charred, flooded or dead. If we don’t start lowering emissions and turning this around fast, these will be the good old days.
Wendy Blais, North Hills
..
To the editor:Has it occurred to anyone that perhaps we shouldn’t be fighting Mother Nature?
Rather than spending billions of dollars pushing back fires in essentially wilderness areas, preventing rising water levels from inundating low-lying areas or tearing down bluffs overlooking the ocean, perhaps it’s humans who should retreat and regroup.
If humans were to come together and admit climate change is a real thing, we would stop treating Mother Nature as an enemy to defeat and instead live where she can be our ally.

"Fires have closed California forests, roads. These hacks can save your Labor Day plans",https://www.latimes.com/travel/story/2021-08-31/californias-national-forests-closing-heres-what-it-means-for-your-labor-day-plans,2021-08-31,"The U.S. Forest Service’s decision to close almost all of California’s national forests means that thousands of Southern Californians must scrub their Labor Day plans, especially those travelers headed for Mammoth and nearby mountain resorts.
Three things to remember:
So what can you do? Here are some ideas for the long Labor Day weekend.
Verdugo Mountains: These are smaller mountains below the San Gabriel Mountains above Glendale, Burbank and La Cañada-Flintridge. TheBeaudry Motorway Loop to Tongva Peak(six to seven miles) and theVital Link Trail(three to five miles) provide a good workout with nice views. One caveat: The routes are very exposed, which means bring lots of water and go early morning or late evening.Hikespeak outlines more options in the Verdugos here.
Santa Monica Mountains: There are lots of good hiking and biking options in the Santa Monicas, fromsegments of the Backbone Trailto cool high points such as Sandstone Peak and theHidden Pond Loopin Point Mugu State Park. Grab a map or a trail app to find worthy routes.
Orange County: If you haven’t explored O.C. on foot, this weekend may be your opportunity. The Upper Newport Bay Preserve takes you around the coastal wetland with views of the entire bay (eight miles out and back). Whiting Ranch Wilderness Park near Crystal Cove State Park will take you to red rock formations that will remind you of the Southwest.Here are 12 trails to try in OC.
Lifestyle
Whether you’re looking for classic summertime activities like a picnic in a park or ideas for hikes and outings, we’ve got your plans for the final days of summer.
Ocean walks: Shift from the mountains to the sea with bluff trails that keep you above the beach. The Bluffs Beach Trail at San Onofre State Beach keeps you on a high 3.8-mile loop. The Salt Creek Trail in Orange County winds through Dana Point and Laguna Niguel in a 7.6-mile out-and-back route.Check out more ocean-hugging options here.
State and national parks in Southern California: The forest closures don’t affect trails and routes in the Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation Area and state parks such as Kenneth Hahn in the mid-city area, Crystal Cove near Newport Beach, Malibu Creek in Calabasas and Chino Hills. The coastal parks are great Labor Day destinations but you can expect large crowds this holiday weekend. Plan accordingly.
Local parks:Griffithand Elysian parks are good places to get moving outdoors in the urban realm. You can avoid some of the biggest crowds by going early or late in the day (trails in Griffith Park are open until 10 p.m.). Get out a map or app and look for less-well-known routes, such as theshady Cedar Grovein Griffith Park. Other big regional parks to try: Franklin Canyon Park on the Westside and O’Melveny Park in Granada Hills.
The U.S. Forest Service imposed the closures to “provide public and firefighter safety due to the ongoing California wildfire crisis,” its order said. It also underscored the need to prevent new fires rom starting and keep people out of areas that suddenly may become unsafe or need to be evacuated.
Theaction, which took effect at 11:59 p.m. Tuesday, shuts a hefty chunk of the state’s public land, including many campgrounds, through at least Sept. 17.
Caltranstweetedthat at 11:59 p.m. Tuesday its crews would close these Angeles National Forest routes: California 2 at Angeles Forest Highway (about 7 miles above La Cañada-Flintridge); California 2 at Big Pines; California 39 at Gateway Center; Golden State Highway at Interstate 5; and the Old Ridge Route at California 138.
California
‘We’ve got this thing kind of lassoed, and we just need to keep holding on to it with what we’ve got,’ one official said.
L.A. County road closures include Upper Big Tujunga Canyon Road at California 2 and Angeles Forest Highway; Mt. Baldy Road at Shinn Road near San Antonio Canyon; Glendora Mountain Road and Glendora Ridge Road; and San Dimas Canyon Road. L.A. County updates road closures onthe Public Works website.
Statewide, many roads through national forests remain open if there’s no immediate fire danger. “If it’s a state or county road, we don’t have jurisdiction to close it,” said Deb Schweizer, public affairs officer for Inyo National Forest.
Among the affected mountain resort areas:
Mammoth Mountainin Inyo National Forest, has shut its Mammoth Bike Park, Via Ferrata, Adventure Center, Scenic Gondola and Camp High Sierra for the summer. Resort management has promised refunds to travelers with activity reservations, event tickets or lodging reservations for Camp Sierra.
The Mammoth resort’s historic Tamarack Lodge will also be closed through at least Sept. 17, prompting the resort to offer help with rebooking or refunds.
AtSnow Valleyin the San Bernardino National Forest, which has been offering mountain biking and chair lift rides Fridays through Mondays, management slapped an“operations suspended”notice on the resort website late Monday night.
California
California’s national forests will temporarily be closed, officials with the Forest Service confirmed Monday.
In a message to the public, management noted that the closure is because of statewide needs, not any specific fire. The resort’s leaders also said that they hope to reopen “at a moment’s notice” and stay open through Oct. 31.
Big Bear Mountain Resortsuspended operations too. That means the bike park, Scenic Sky Chair and other summer activities won’t operate until at least Sept. 17. Guests with reservations may reschedule or request a refund. (The Bear Mountain Golf Course remains open so far.)
AtMountain Highin Angeles National Forest, disc golf and restaurant operations have shut down.
Mt. Baldy Resortin Angeles National Forest, typically offers zip lines, lift rides, tent cabins and dining at the Top of the Notch restaurant. As of 9 a.m. Friday, resort management still had not changed its website in the wake of the forest closures. An annualRun to the Topevent scheduled for Labor Day has been canceled, to be rescheduled for October.
California
Forests surrounding Lake Tahoe have endured colonization, clear-cut logging and aggressive fire suppression that have upended the natural balance of wildfires.
Management of the Palm Springs Aerial Tramway, which operates in the San Bernardino National Forest, and the still-openMt. San Jacinto State Park,had previously announced that it would close for annual maintenance Sept. 7 through Oct. 3.
Spokesman Greg Purdy said “the tram has permission to continue operations” through Labor Day, “but camping and backcountry hiking are, of course, suspended.”
Besides its effects on local hikers, the closures halt foot traffic on long-distance routes that cross national forest land, including the 2,650-milePacific Crest Trail. “If you are out there now, it’s time to start walking out to the trailhead,” the Pacific Crest Trail Assn. posted in itsonline closure alerts.
The Forest Service order allows property owners and lease-holders within the forests to access their land, and it allows special-use permit-holders to “conduct administrative functions and to protect property and related assets.”
In the Lake Tahoe region threatened bythe Caldor fire, resorts closed days ago, and many are evacuating from the South Lake Tahoe area.
The U.S. Forest Service manages roughly 20 million acres of forest land in California. Of the state’s 9 million acres of “highly volatile brushland,”about 6 millionare managed by the Forest Service.
Wherever you decide to go for fun in coming days, know where fires are burning.
You don’t want to drive anywhere near active fires or evacuation zones.The largest fires burning in California right nowinclude the Dixie fire, northeast of Chico; the Caldor fire, closing in on South Lake Tahoe; the Monument fire, between Redding and Eureka; the Haypress fire in the Trinity Alps area; and the French fire near Lake Isabella northeast of Bakersfield.
Keep your eye on smaller fires closer to home too. TheL.A.

Also, checkCal Fire, the state’s Department of Forestry and Fire Protection,@cal_fireon Twitter, which provides updates too.
Wildfires also temporarily shuttered public lands last summer. Forest Service officials closed the state’s 18 national forests on Sept. 9, citing “unprecedented and historic fire conditions.” Thirty state parks and parts of California 1, affected by the Creek fire in Sierra National Forest, also were closed.

Evacuation orders issued in Nevada as Caldor fire moves toward Lake Tahoe,https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2021-08-31/nevada-issues-evacuation-warnings-as-wildfire-nears-lake-tahoe,2021-09-01,"GARDNERVILLE, Nev. —While the Caldor fire continues to threaten South Lake Tahoe, it is also taking aim at Nevada, prompting new evacuation orders Tuesday afternoon.
Nevada Gov. Steve Sisolak on Mondaydeclared a state of emergency“in the anticipation of the fire crossing from California into the state of Nevada in the coming days,” his office said.

“We are asking residents to say vigilant, pay attention to emergency phone alerts and have a plan in place for potential evacuations,” officials said.
By late Tuesday afternoon, newevacuation orderscame through for the mountain areas just past the state line, including Kingsbury at the top of Daggett Summit. There, half a dozen sheriffs deputies in safety vests began a door-to-door notification as most residents packed their cars and headed out.
Ryan Guest was filling his red  Toyota 4Runner with clothes in garbage bags and bins. He returned from Cabo San Lucas only a few weeks ago but is now heading back on the road to San Diego, where he has family.
“It’s not worth it,” he said of the risk of staying.
California
The Caldor fire is moving toward Nevada, prompting evacuations, while firefighters in the South Lake Tahoe area try to “herd” flames away from homes and structures.
Many residents from Tahoe and nearby areas had already piled into the evacuation center  at Douglas County Community Center in Gardnerville, Nev., not far from the state line. Ash fell from a yellow sky Tuesday and blanketed the parking lot.
It fell on the dozens of cars and RVs owned by nearby residents who were forced to evacuate their homes as theCaldor fireapproached the Lake Tahoe Basin and threatened to move east.
Standing near three tents set up at the edge of the evacuation center’s parking lot, Rick and Lee Wright, who are ski instructors at Heavenly Mountain Resort, said they had never been evacuated from their home before.
“I didn’t think it could happen,” Rick Wright, 60, said. “I thought they would throw an army in there to stop it from getting to Tahoe, but it became real Sunday night, you know?”
For days the Caldor fire had beenmoving towardthe popular ski resort town. Black smoke billowed out of the fire as it burned acres of forest trees. Wright said it was “dead calm” on Sunday night. There were no winds, just smoke. Then came the evacuation warning.
The Wrights, whose home is two miles southeast of South Lake Tahoe, began loading clothes, photos and documents into a red Ford Expedition and a blue Subaru. Several days before, Wright said, he had packed up two other cars they owned and driven them down to a friend’s house as a precaution.
“We were ready to go anytime,” he said. It was around 10:30 p.m. when a police officer knocked on their door, telling them that there was an evacuation warning but urging them to leave.
“The mandatory evacuation order is coming quickly,” Wright recalled the officer saying.
Concern for his nervous wife and granddaughter, 2-year-old Wynn, he decided to evacuate. It was about 1:30 a.m. when they began to make the 45-minute drive down the mountain to the evacuation center in Nevada. On the way down he tried to keep his wife calm.
“I just told her we were out,” he said. “ I said, ‘We got the baby, we’re good.’”
At the evacuation center, Wright began to set up the tents, which he had bought five months ago to go camping.
“We’re doing it now,” he said, chuckling. “We’re camping.”
California
A wildfire in South Lake Tahoe would not only threaten lives and homes; it would also move faster, burn hotter and be significantly harder to fight, experts say.
Late  Tuesday afternoon, the Douglas County Sheriff’s Officeorderedthe following communities to evacuate immediately:
The evacuation warning also includes areas from Highway 50 at Lake Parkway, east to Elks Point Road; and State Route 207 from Highway 50 to Tramway Drive.
In response to the rapidly changing situation, the Nevada Department of Transportation is also closing the following roads, although residents and employees who must enter the area to access their home or work will be allowed to do so, officials said:
“On behalf of the state of Nevada, I would like to thank all of our brave first responders, local government agencies, and nonprofit entities who continue to go above and beyond to assist our communities during the Caldor fire,” Sisolak said in a statement. “We will continue to use all our available resources to fight this fire and assist those in need.”
Southern portions of the Lake Tahoe Basin in California wereevacuated Mondayas the fire crept closer to the famed resort area. Thousands of residents fled, creating an hours-long traffic jam along Highway 50.
The fire is beingdriven by high winds, with red flag warnings indicating the potential for strong gusts through at least Wednesday evening. Fire officials said they are very concerned that airborne embers could quickly ignite spot fires beyond the lines of the fire.
“We do have very active fire behavior, spotting and torching and very dry fuels under these drought conditions” said Capt. Brian Newman of the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection. “We expect this active firefight to continue over the next couple days under this current weather condition.”
California
Thousands rushed to leave South Lake Tahoe as the resort city came under an evacuation order due to the Caldor fire.
At the evacuation center, Phoenix Hunter, 53, a ski instructor, said she began to worry about the fire when she learned that the ski resort she works for, Sierra-at-Tahoe, had called in a hotshot crew to protect the property.
“I had my antenna up,” she said, smiling. She said the resort used snow guns to spray water on the property. ReportsemergedMonday that some of its buildings were in flames.
Hunter got an evacuation warning Sunday night and began to place personal items into her Subaru. It was late Monday morning when she began to leave her home with her 15-year-old daughter, two dogs and a rabbit named Butterscotch.
“I was about to leave the house when the [mandatory evacuation order] came in,” she said.
For Hunter and her daughter, it was the second time they had to evacuate. In 2007,the Angora fireforced her to evacuate her home. Her daughter was 1 at the time. Hunter said that she left behind a dog then but that this time she felt more prepared and calm. Still she can’t help but feel some stress.
“I try to look at the bright side that I’m alive and not in the bull’s-eye of the fire,” she said. “I’m sad that some people are, but I try to help others as much as I can.”
“Things could always be worse,” she said.

"‘Unprecedented’ Caldor, Dixie fires are the first to burn from one side of the Sierra to the other",https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2021-08-31/caldor-and-dixie-fires-first-burn-from-one-side-of-sierra-to-the-other,2021-08-31,"Faced with drought conditions and rising temperatures from climate change, California has hit manygrim fire milestones in the last few years.
In 2020, California saw the most destructive fire season on record. But 2021 is shaping up to be another one for the record books, with the conditions producing fire behavior never seen before.
California
Thousands rushed to leave South Lake Tahoe as the resort city came under an evacuation order due to the Caldor fire.
The Dixie fire is now thesecond-largest in statehistory and still burning out of control.
The 190,000-acre Caldor fire is much smaller but now threatens more than 33,000 homes in the Lake Tahoe Basin, an area many residents believed was fairly well protected from fires.
WILDFIRE UPDATE: The raging#CaldorFirecontinues to threaten communities near#LakeTahoe, seen here last evening from@NOAA's#GOES17🛰️. At last report, the#wildfirehad grown to 186,500+ acres and the governors of Calif. and Nev. have declared states of emergency.#CAwx#NVwxpic.twitter.com/K6qqs5KB8b
Chief Thom Porter, of the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection, said that before this year, no fire was known to have burned from one side of the Sierra to the other.
The Caldor and Dixie fires have now achieved that feat.
“Two times in our history and they’re both happening this month,” Porter said. “So we need to be really cognizant that there is fire activity happening in California that we have never seen before.”
The Caldor fire has also changed the view of fire risk in Lake Tahoe.
“Historically, we’ve used terms such as ‘anomaly,’ ‘unprecedented’ or ‘extreme’ to describe the wildfires that we have seen burn throughout the state over the past 10 to 20 years,” Cal Fire spokesman Chris Anthony said Monday evening. “These terms are no longer appropriate given the clear trends associated with drought,changing climateand un-resilient forest stands. Unfortunately, these factors contribute to the resistance to control that we are seeing with the Caldor fire.”

A granite ridge that overlooks the Tahoe basin was always seen as protection against a fire sweeping into the region. Officials say it could have some mitigating effects on the fire, officials said.
Unlike lower elevations populated by hot-burning manzanita brush, ponderosa pine and cedar trees, the ridge is characterized by fir trees and more spare, open areas that can help slow the fire’s spread.
But with powerful winds Monday, embers were flowing and that set brush on fire closer to the basin.
“They have long looked to that granite wall as what’s going to keep fire out,” said Crystal Kolden, a fire scientist at UC Merced. “But this is a new world withclimate change,and that basically is no longer a viable last line of defense.”

So far, the Caldor fire has primarily fed on vegetation, Kolden said; but if the fire makes it into nearby communities, that will rapidly change. Homes and other structures would not only provide additional fuel for the fire, but also releasedangerous chemicalsinto the air, along with “tremendous embers.”
“It’s an Alpine community with log cabins, and a lot of those structures were built in the ’40s, ’50s, and ’60s,” she said. “So you’ve got this potential for it to really start jumping from building to building to building, and it’s just a completely different beast and they can’t fight it.”
Wildland fires can typically burn up to about 1,500 degrees, Kolden said, while structure fires can burn closer to 3,600 degrees.
“It’s so dangerous, it’s so toxic, and there’s so much heat,” she said.

"Caldor fire pushes toward Nevada, South Lake Tahoe still under threat",https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2021-08-31/caldor-fire-enters-lake-tahoe-basin-threatening-homes,2021-09-01,"SOUTH LAKE TAHOE, Calif. —Firefighters made an all-out effort Tuesday to defend South Lake Tahoe and surrounding communities as the Caldor fire raced toward Nevada and forced anotherslew of evacuations.
Officials said they managed to “herd” the flames away from homes and structures, including many in the Christmas Valley and Meyers, but that the threat is not yet gone: Another day of strong winds and bone-dry conditions is still to come, and crews are bracing for a continuous battle against airborne embers and fast-moving flare-ups.
“Tomorrow is going to be another bad weather day, I’ll be honest with you,” incident meteorologist Jim Dudley said Tuesday evening. “But it will be the last one of those. There is a light at the end of this tunnel.”
Yet little about the Caldor fire has been predictable, with crews on Tuesday describing flames slopping over containment lines, running between treetops and casting embers more than a mile away.
Fire behavior analyst Steven Volmer said given the hot, dry conditions in the fire area, the probability of an errant ember sparking a new fire was “extremely high” — above 90%. And when fires do start, they can spread at speeds of 200 feet per minute between the crowns of trees, and about 100 feet per minute on the ground, he said.
Fueled by heavy winds, the Caldor fire had already jumped Highways 50 and 89 and threatened Echo Summit. Some structures had burned, but it was unclear how many.
By Tuesday night the 199,000-acre blaze was only 18% contained, officials said, and nearly 35,000 structures were threatened. The National Weather Serviceextended its forecastfor intense winds moving to the east and southeast through 11 p.m. Wednesday evening, promising more challenges.
Gov. Gavin Newsom said that of the 15large active wildfiresburning in California, the Caldor fire is among the most worrisome.
“It’s our No. 1 priority to put everything we’ve got on it,” Newsom said, including fire retardant being dropped by aircraft, helicopters making water drops, and the National Guarddeployedto battle the blaze.
California
Thousands rushed to leave South Lake Tahoe as the resort city came under an evacuation order due to the Caldor fire.
Along Highway 50 on Tuesday afternoon, dozens of strike teams from around the state were lined up in their trucks awaiting assignments. Multiple plumes of smoke rose skyward as dozens of spot fires burned in the valley below.
As in the night prior, Tuesday’s mission was to save homes and structures along Pioneer Trail, where the fire was most active, said Dave Lauchner, spokesman for the incident management team and a battalion chief with the Sacramento Fire Department.
Lauchner said that while most structures were saved Monday night, “it was crazy. A lot of fire, turbulent winds.”
Lauchner said he expected more extreme behavior in coming hours as the wind increases.
“We knew this was coming,” he said of the gusts. “The problem is it’s not one direction. It comes from the canyons in all directions.”
California
The Caldor fire has also changed the view of fire risk in Lake Tahoe.
For many on the fire crews here, the fight is not just professional, it’s personal too. Lauchner’s parents own a cabin just two miles up the road. A few days ago he was reassuring his mother that the fire could never reach this far. Now he’s had to revise that story.
“This fire does stuff I’ve never seen before,” he said.
California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection spokesman Chris Anthony echoed that sentiment during an operations update.
“Historically, we’ve used terms such as ‘anomaly,’ ‘unprecedented’ or ‘extreme’ to describe the wildfires that we have seen burn throughout the state over the past 10 to 20 years,” Anthony said. “These terms are no longer appropriate given the clear trends associated with drought,changing climateand unresilient forest stands.”
“Unfortunately, these factors contribute to the resistance to control that we are seeing with the Caldor fire,” he added.
Cal Fire chief Thom Porter noted that the Caldor fire and the nearby Dixie fire were the first to burnfrom one side of the Sierra to the other.

A wildfire in South Lake Tahoe would not only threaten lives and homes; it would also move faster, burn hotter and be significantly harder to fight, experts say.
Officials still hope the fire won’t hit the city of South Lake Tahoe. If it does, experts say it could be profoundly destructive.
Not only would an urban conflagration in that area threaten lives and homes, but it also would move faster, burn hotter and besignificantly harder to fight, according to experts.
“They have long looked to that granite wall as what’s going to keep fire out,” said Crystal Kolden, a fire scientist at UC Merced, referring to a stony ridge atop the Tahoe Basin. “But this is a new world withclimate change,and that basically is no longer a viable last line of defense.”
Mandatory evacuations were ordered Monday for the South Lake Tahoe area, causing hours of traffic jams. But by the afternoon, the traffic had eased and the towns were empty.
Theevacuation ordercovers nearly all of the Lake Tahoe Basin in El Dorado County, from the California-Nevada state line on the lake’s southern end to Tahoma on its western shore. Just over the state line in Nevada, officials placed many residentsunder evacuation ordersTuesday afternoon, spurring new concerns that the fire might cross state lines.
At the Douglas County Community Center in Gardnerville, Nev., ash fell from a yellow sky onto dozens of cars and RVs owned by residents who were recently forced to evacuate. Standing near three tents set up at the edge of the evacuation center’s parking lot, Rick and Lee Wright, who are both ski instructors at Heavenly Mountain Resort, said they had never been evacuated from their home before.
“I didn’t think it could happen,” Rick Wright, 60, said. “I thought they would throw an army in there to stop it from getting to Tahoe, but it became real Sunday night, you know?”
Wright said it was around 10:30 p.m. Sunday when a police officer knocked on their door, telling them that there was an evacuation warning but urging them to leave.
“The mandatory evacuation order is coming quickly,” Wright recalled the officer saying. Concerned for his nervous wife and granddaughter, 2-year-old Wynn, he decided to evacuate.
It was about 1:30 a.m. when they began to make the 45-minute drive down the mountain to the evacuation center in Nevada. On the way down he tried to keep his wife calm.
“I just told her we were out,” he said. “ I said, ‘We got the baby, we’re good.’”
At the evacuation center, Wright began to set up the tents, which he had bought five months ago to go camping. “We’re doing it now,” he said, chuckling. “We’re camping.”
But not everyone heeded the orders.
Jason Pope was one of the few holdouts Tuesday — stuck behind because of an unreliable car and a cat and dog he was housesitting.
“My little car won’t make it down the hill,” he said, gesturing to a 2006 Subaru. He had just reached the friend whose house he was guarding, but who is now overseas on vacation. They offered him the use of their newer Subaru wagon to get the pets to the state line, where Pope’s friend in Cal Fire was going to ferry them to Pope’s uncle.
But Pope didn’t want to cross the evacuation line himself because he wouldn’t be able to return, and he needed to get his own two dogs out.
He said he was not that concerned about the fire, though. He made it through the Angora fire in 2007 and changed out his old shingle roof for one that could withstand flames. He’s got sprinklers going and his neighbors doused their homes and he just doesn’t think the fire will actually make it into town.
Even if it does, he said, his property “is like a mud puddle.”
But the fire’s behavior has been erratic. Operations section chief Tim Ernst said Tuesday that winds over the last 24 hours had blown in excess of 40 mph, with some gusts surging over 50 mph, and were sending embers aloft that could create new fires.
“One of the complexities that we face with this fire is that firebrands can be picked up by winds like that and carried a great distance,” he said. “Yesterday, we had firebrands spotting a mile away from the head of the fire. That’s an extremely challenging fire environment for firefighters to deal with.”
California
Lake Tahoe faces disastrous ‘urban conflagration’ if Caldor fire reaches communities
Cal Fire officials said they have been preparing for this exact scenario, with one official on Tuesday noting that they may even try to steer the blaze into the footprint of the nearbyTamarack fire, where it could be slowed by the lack of fuel in the freshly burned terrain.
“We knew it could happen, and we spent millions of dollars and thousands of hours on public education, evacuation planning, community meetings, defensible-space inspections, shipping programs, home-hardening outreach, fuels-reduction projects and prescribed fire and forest health projects,” said Anthony, the Cal Fire spokesman.
“Although we cannot predict the outcome of the Caldor fire,” he added, “I want to remind the Tahoe community that you are prepared. … These are no doubt trying times, but we will get through them together.”
Michael Hicks, who owns thehistoric Strawberry Lodgeon Highway 50, was among the many area residents anxiously watching the fire’s path from afar.
“Hopefully they can save as much of the community as possible,” Hicks said. But, he added, that is “up to the winds and the firefighters.”

"As Caldor fire closes in on Lake Tahoe, crews scramble to prevent worst-case scenario",https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2021-08-31/as-caldor-fire-closes-in-on-lake-tahoe-crews-scramble-to-prevent-a-worst-case-scenario,2021-08-31,"It was a moment officials hoped would never come: The mass evacuation of South Lake Tahoe in the face of a rapidly approaching wildfire.
Even though the Caldorfire had been creeping ever closer to the famed resort townfor days, few residents thought it would actually arrive. Most spoke reverently of a towering granite ridge a few miles away that they believed would prevent flames from dropping down into the Lake Tahoe Basin.
By Monday morning however, the wind-whipped fire had made alarming progress, raising the specter of an uncontrolled urban fire and sending residents fleeing undermandatory evacuation orders.
“Today’s been a rough day, and there’s no bones about it,” Eldorado National Forest supervisor Jeff Marsolais said.
California
Thousands rushed to leave South Lake Tahoe as the resort city came under an evacuation order due to the Caldor fire.
The evacuation comes amid a summer of extreme fire behavior, as heat, drought and wind stoke flames and strain the state’s firefighting capabilities. In response to the crisis, the U.S. Forest Service announced Monday that it wouldclose all national forestsin California for roughly two weeks, beginning at 11:59 p.m. Tuesday. The Pentagon agreed to send hundreds of U.S. Army personnel to help battle flames in Northern California.
The Tahoeevacuation ordercovers nearly all of the Lake Tahoe Basin in El Dorado County, from the California-Nevada state line on the lake’s southern end to Tahoma on its western shore.
For nearly a week, the area had been choked ineye-burning smokeand a layer of ash thick enough to leave footprints. The vacationers who typically populate Tahoe each summer had long sinceabandoned recreation plans,while swarms of gnats and flies swooped down from the fire’s edge, suggesting that even the bugs were leaving town.
Whether the Caldor fire reaches South Lake Tahoe remains to be seen, and firefighters are working fast and hard to prevent a worst-case scenario.
But thestrong windsmoving into the area — along with the severe dryness of the state’s terrain — are a recipe for catastrophe. Not only would an urban conflagration in the South Lake Tahoe area threaten lives and homes — it would also move faster, burn hotter and be significantly harder to fight, according to experts.
“They have long looked to that granite wall as what’s going to keep fire out,” said Crystal Kolden, a fire scientist at UC Merced. “But this is a new world withclimate change,and that basically is no longer a viable last line of defense.”
So far, the Caldor fire has primarily fed on vegetation, Kolden said; but if the fire makes it into nearby communities, that will rapidly change. Homes and other structures would not only provide additional fuel for the fire, but also releasedangerous chemicalsinto the air, along with “tremendous embers.”
“It’s an Alpine community with log cabins, and a lot of those structures were built in the ’40s, ’50s, and ’60s,” she said. “So you’ve got this potential for it to really start jumping from building to building to building, and it’s just a completely different beast and they can’t fight it.”
Wildland fires can typically burn up to about 1,500 degrees, Kolden said, while structure fires can burn closer to 3,600.
“It’s so dangerous, it’s so toxic, and there’s so much heat,” she said.
Residents in the basin were tracking the fire’s movement for days, with many hunkering down with air purifiers to mitigate yellow-gray smoke. Some said they were concerned that a mass evacuation would lead to chaos, as much of Highway 50 is closed and there aren’t many roads out of Tahoe.
California
On the front lines of battle to keep Caldor fire from hitting Lake Tahoe
Already on Monday, the were reports that the highway was more like aparking lotas residents fled east into Nevada and were caught in an hours-long traffic jam.
“For us, that was a good sign,” South Lake Fire Chief Clive Savacool said. “It meant our citizens were listening to the evacuation orders.”
Carol Bin, 61, said she moved her horses to Gardnerville, Nev., last week. A former Big Bear resident, she has faced evacuations before, and she wasn’t eager to do it again.
“The hardest part is to pack,” Bin said from her driveway in the Christmas Valley. “Do I pack for a week? Or do I pack like I’m never coming back?”
California
The raging Caldor fire was within striking distance of the historic lodge tucked along Highway 50 on Saturday.
The granite ridge that overlooks the Tahoe basin could have some mitigating effects on the fire, officials said. Unlike lower elevations populated by hot-burning manzanita brush, ponderosa pine and cedar trees, the ridge is characterized by fir trees and more spare, open areas that can help slow the fire’s spread.
But it wasn’t fuel so much as wind that officials were worried about Monday.
Caldor fire spokesman Jason Hunter said the fire had been spotting — or generating wind-blown sparks, which can create new fires — at half-mile distances in recent days. Strengthening winds in the area, however, could easily expand that to well over a mile.Red-flag warningsin the fire zone indicated that there could be gusts as strong as 35 mph through Tuesday evening.
“Our significant concern is that spotting,” Hunter said. Specifically, crews were worried about “embers being blown from up at the ridge top landing somewhere down in the valley and taking hold.”
Hunter said crews on Monday were busy making tactical fire stops along the Highway 50 corridor on Echo Summit in an effort to get ahead of further creep.
But Kolden noted that many of the homes in the Tahoe area have shake roofs, wooden porches and a buildup of pine cones and needles.
“It’s so dry that it is perfect kindling,” Kolden said, adding that if embers do drift down into the basin, “then it’s just a function of the wind and the fuels carrying the fire into South Lake.”
California
As the destructive Caldor fire creeps closer to the popular resort area, the boaters, hikers and beach-goers who typically descend on South Lake Tahoe have all but vanished.
Concern about the potential for disaster is mounting far beyond Tahoe’s typically emerald shores. The fire’s advance has alarmed President Biden’s administration, which has otherwise been preoccupied byHurricane Idaon the Gulf Coast.
“We are tracking the wildfires,” White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki said at Monday’s press briefing. She added, “We will continue to assess if additional resources are needed.”
Already, more than 15,000 personnel are working on California’s fires, including nearly 1,200 fire engines, 315 hand crews, 367 dozer units, 411 water tenders and 111 helicopters, officials said during an emergency operations update Monday.
The assistance includes 1,059 California National Guard soldiers, sailors and airmen who are providing support to fire suppression operations that range between space-based platforms to boots on the ground, Maj. Gen. Dave Baldwin said. Most recently, 150 military police members were sent to help El Dorado County and the California Highway Patrol conduct traffic control points and secure evacuated areas, he said.
In addition, the National Interagency Fire Center has requested that about 200 active-duty U.S. Army soldiers be deployed to serve as firefighting hand crews. They were scheduled to be trained over the next week and sent to fire lines in Northern California in early September, the fire center said in a news release.
However, the two fires that authorities have deemed critical — the Caldor andthe Dixie fires— continue to display unprecedented behavior.
Chief Thom Porter, of the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection, said that before this year, no fire was known to have burned from one side of the Sierra to the other. Both the Caldor and Dixie fires have now achieved that feat.
“Two times in our history and they’re both happening this month,” Porter said. “So we need to be really cognizant that there is fire activity happening in California that we have never seen before.”
More than 43,400 Californians have been told to evacuate from their homes amid the state’s worsening conflagrations, said Mark Ghilarducci, director of the California Governor’s Office of Emergency Services.
“We know these are difficult times, and we continue to be all hands on deck,” he said.
The forested area where the Caldor fire is burning has beenbeset by fire before. In the mid-1800s, the rise of steam-powered logging equipment, lumber mills and railroads increased the potential for fires to ignite. Newspaper accounts in the 1880s told of whole towns being destroyed.
Tahoe City, which then consisted of about 50 houses, two hotels and some stores, burned down in 1894, according to The Los Angeles Times’ archives. Another fire in 1898 burned from the Rubicon area back in the mountains to the shore of the lake, destroying “a vast amount of valuable timber,” the archives state.
And many locals in South Lake Tahoe said they still remember the Angora fire of 2007 — another wind-driven wildfire in El Dorado County that spurred evacuations and destroyed more than 200 homes. Officials blamed high winds and low humidity for the speed with which it swept through the area.
But that fire never grew much beyond 3,000 acres. The Caldor fire, by comparison, had seared through more than 177,000 acres by Monday morning, and it was only 14% contained.
Michael Hicks, who owns thehistoric Strawberry Lodgeon Highway 50, was among the many area residents anxiously watching the fire’s path from afar.
“Hopefully they can save as much of the community as possible,” Hicks said. But, he added, that is “up to the winds and the firefighters.”

Why the Lake Tahoe area is vulnerable to wildfire,https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2021-08-30/why-lake-tahoe-is-vulnerable-to-wildfire,2021-08-31,"As the Caldor firecontinues to spread, authorities are nervously eyeing the Lake Tahoe Basin as a potential area of devastation.
The forest there, like many others in the western United States, has endured a history of colonization, clear-cut logging and aggressive fire suppression that have upended the natural balance of wildfires. What’s more, it’s populated, with tens of thousands of people who live there year-round and an estimated 15 million who visit each year, according to the local visitors bureau.
Some officials fear the factors could line up to create a disaster that outpaces the Angora fire of 2007.
Thousands of years ago, low-intensity fires regularly burned through the basin, clearing out dense young vegetation. The Washoe people are believed to have set some of these fires for land management purposes; others were sparked by lightning but weren’t put out right away, according to a U.S. Forest Service report on the area’s fire history.
California
Thousands rushed to leave South Lake Tahoe as the resort city came under an evacuation order due to the Caldor fire.
Europeans colonized the area in the mid-1800s and began clear-cutting trees to supply nearby towns and the Comstock Lode mines with lumber. Researchers estimate that more than 60% of the basin had been stripped by the turn of the century. The trees grew back at roughly the same height, with their comparatively young age and lack of diversity leaving them more vulnerable to damaging fire.
Around the same time, the rise of steam-powered logging equipment, lumber mills and railroads increased the potential for fires to ignite. Newspaper accounts in the 1880s told of entire towns being destroyed. Tahoe City, which then consisted of about 50 houses, two hotels and some stores, burned down in 1894, according to The Los Angeles Times’ archives. Another fire in 1898 burned from the Rubicon area in the mountains to the shore of the lake, destroying “a vast amount of valuable timber,” the archives state.
To stem the losses, the federal government in the early 1900s adopted a policy of putting out wildfires on public lands as quickly as it could. By 1926, the U.S. Forest Service had put in place a directive to suppress all fires at 10 acres or less, an approach adopted by other agencies.

Lake Tahoe faces disastrous ‘urban conflagration’ if Caldor fire reaches communities
Meanwhile, people continued to move into the Lake Tahoe Basin in droves. After World War II, tens of thousands of homes were built amid the trees, and neighborhoods are now filled with alpine-style houses with wood shake roofing and wooden decks, their yards blanketed in pine needles.
While well-intentioned, the aggressive fire suppression practices served to further block the natural cycle of low-intensity fires. They were, up to a point, successful: As recently as 2004, no fire in the area had grown to more than 2,000 acres since 1908, according to a U.S. Forest Service report.
Then,in 2007, the Angora fire, which was sparked by an abandoned campfire, scorched more than 3,100 acres, destroying 254 homes and 75 other structures over six days. Officials blamed high winds and low humidity for the speed with which the fire swept through the area.

For many residents in Northern California, summer has now become a time of dread due to extreme wildfires.
Similar conditions were in place Monday, as the Caldor fire approached the Lake Tahoe Basin, having already burned 177,260 acres and destroyed more than 470 homes.

Lake Tahoe faces disastrous ‘urban conflagration’ if Caldor fire reaches communities,https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2021-08-30/as-caldor-fire-grows-lake-tahoe-communities-face-great-risks,2021-08-30,"The Caldor fire is closing in on the Lake Tahoe Basin and threatening the popular resort area.
SOUTH LAKE TAHOE, Calif. —As firefighters make anall-out pushto keep the Caldor fire out of Lake Tahoe, expertswarned of potentially catastrophic lossesif flames move into neighborhoods along the famed lakeside resort.
Were embers to take hold in the Tahoe valley, it could cause a disastrous “urban conflagration,” said Crystal Kolden, a fire scientist at UC Merced.
She noted that the Alpine village is full of old homes and log cabins with shake roofs, wooden porches and buildups of pine cones and needles.
California
Thousands rushed to leave South Lake Tahoe as the resort city came under an evacuation order due to the Caldor fire.
“It’s so dry that it is perfect kindling,” she said. “You’ve got his potential for it to really start jumping from building to building to building, and it’s just a completely different beast and they can’t fight it.”
For days, the big question has been whether the fire will jump the large granite ridge that stands between it and populous South Lake Tahoe. Many residents hoped that the stony topography would act as a buffer.
But Monday’s evacuation order was a worrisome indication that crews could be losing footing on the wind-whipped fire. The National Weather Service hasissued red flag warningsindicating gusty wind conditions in the area from 11 a.m. through 11 p.m. Tuesday.
Jason Hunter, a Caldor fire information officer, said Monday that the fire was still holding to the west of that ridge but worried that strong winds just beginning to pick up could generate spot fires and unpredictable behavior.
In the last few days, the fire has been spotting — or producing sparks that are carried by the wind and start new fires — about half a mile ahead of itself, but crews are expecting that distance to expand to more than a mile on Monday due to wind, he said.
“Our significant concern is that spotting,” he said. Specifically, crews were worried about “embers being blown from up at the ridge top landing somewhere down in the valley and taking hold.”
Concern about the potential for disaster is mounting far beyond Tahoe’s typically emerald shores.
The fire’s advance has alarmed President Biden’s administration, which has otherwise been preoccupied by Hurricane Ida on the Gulf Coast.
“We are tracking the wildfires,” White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki said at a Monday press briefing. She added, “We will continue to assess if additional resources are needed.”
The Caldor fire is one of more than a dozen fires burning in California, according to the California Department of Forestry and Fire Prevention.
Hunter said crews on Monday were making tactical fire stops along the Highway 50 corridor on Echo Summit in an effort to get ahead of further creep.
“The fire blew up yesterday at a significant rate of spread and critical growth,” he said. “The winds picked up significantly up in the higher elevations, [and are] still pushing it in that northeasterly direction.”

Caldor fire rages toward Lake Tahoe: Next 48 hours will be crucial,https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2021-08-30/caldor-fire-lake-tahoe-conditions-evacuations,2021-08-30,"The Caldor fire is closing in on the Lake Tahoe Basin and threatening the popular resort area.
SOUTH LAKE TAHOE, Calif. —The Caldor fire is closing in on the Lake Tahoe Basin andthreatening the popular resort area.
Officials say the next two days will be crucial as powerful winds push the fire. Here is a breakdown of what we know:
California
Thousands rushed to leave South Lake Tahoe as the resort city came under an evacuation order due to the Caldor fire.
Although there is still activity on the western perimeter, the majority of recent growth in the Caldor fire has been on its northeastern edge, near the towns of Strawberry and Kyburz and in the direction of the Lake Tahoe Basin.
Crews on Sunday were working hard and fast to get ahead of the shift, but they were met with increasingly erratic conditions and extreme fire behavior. Fire officials had hoped a granite ridge between the fire and the Lake Tahoe Basin would be the best opportunity to get ahead of the blaze.
California
Evacuations are ordered as the Caldor fire marches toward Lake Tahoe. Officials say fire dangers heightened this weekend due to winds and high temperatures.
Jason Hunter, Caldor fire information officer, said Monday the fire was still holding to the west of that ridge but worried that strong winds just beginning to pick up could generate spot fires and unpredictable behavior. In the last few days, the fire has been spotting — or producing sparks that are carried by the wind and start new fires — about one-half mile ahead of itself, but crews are expecting that distance to expand to more than a mile due to wind, he said.
“Our significant concern is that spotting,” he said, with “the embers being blown from up at the ridge top landing somewhere down in the valley and taking hold.”
Strong winds fueled spot fires and flareups that saw gains slip away by Monday morning, as containment on the 177,260-acre fire dropped from 19% Sunday morning back down to 14%.
“A couple of days ago, I really felt we were turning a corner with it,” operations section chief Eric Schwab said Sunday, noting that the fire had been creeping eastward at a pace of about half a mile each day.
But on Sunday, it “moved about 2½ miles on us,” he said, “with no sign that it’s starting to slow down.”
More than 20,000 structures are threatened by the fire, including many in the populous Lake Tahoe Basin, officials said.
The area is typicallypacked with summertime revelersat this time of year, but evacuations and thick, noxious smoke have turned it into a ghost town.
The National Weather Serviceissued red flag warningsindicating gusty wind conditions in the area through 11 p.m. Tuesday.
“We are expecting a big change in the weather pattern,” incident meteorologist Jim Dudley said during a briefing Saturday evening. “What will happen is that the winds that have been affecting the fire on the ground level … are going to be aided by southwesterly winds aloft.”
Officials said the winds would meet with hot, dry weather to create elevated fire conditions. Gusts on Monday were expected to be as strong as 35 mph.
The fire was spotting at distances as far as three-fourths of a mile, and the probability of those spots creating new fires is 90%, according to fire behavior analyst Steven Volmer.
In the days to come, that probability will increase to 95%.
One challenge is the area’s topography, which includes deep drainages and canyons that can act as funnels for the wind and flames.
California
On the front lines of battle to keep Caldor fire from hitting Lake Tahoe
A mandatoryevacuation orderwas issued for communities just south of South Lake Tahoe, including nearly all the Lake Tahoe Basin in El Dorado County, from the California-Nevada state line on the lake’s southern end to Tahoma on its western shore.
Intense smoke from the fire brought terrible air quality to the region, and that prompted many to leave last week.

"Multiple California wildfires prompt evacuations, threaten homes",https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2021-08-30/california-wildfires-evacuations-threaten-homes,2021-08-31,"Multiple wildfires burning across California are creating misery for the state’s residents as they spur evacuations, threaten homes andspew noxious smokeinto the air.
The fight against theCaldor fireburning near South Lake Tahoe took a turn for the worse Sunday, when officials said fire activity was “more aggressive than what was anticipated.” The majority of South Lake Tahoe was placed undermandatory evacuation orders Monday.
Strong winds fueled spot fires and flareups that saw gains slip away, as containment of the 177,260-acre fire dropped from 19% on Sunday morning to 14% by Monday morning. More than 20,000 structures are threatened by the fire.
California
Thousands rushed to leave South Lake Tahoe as the resort city came under an evacuation order due to the Caldor fire.
Acreage and containment updates for the Caldor fire were not available from state fire officials Monday night.
“A couple of days ago I really felt we were turning a corner with it,” operations section chief Eric Schwab said Sunday, noting that the fire had been creeping eastward at a pace of about half a mile each day.
But Sunday, it “moved about 2 ½ miles on us, with no sign that it’s starting to slow down,” he said.
California
The biggest threat to the Tahoe Basin could be yet to come, as the National Weather Service has issued red flag warnings of gusty wind conditions.
During an emergency operations update on Monday, California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection chief Thom Porter said firefighters were starting to get some control on the west side of the fire, where the communities of Sly Park and Grizzly Flats were already heavily damaged.
But they were continuing to struggle on the east side, which is even harder to access. Conditions deteriorated Sunday, when an inversion that had been effectively keeping a lid on recent fire activity lifted, Porter said.
“When air clears, it’s like taking the lid off of your pot of boiling water,” he said. “All of the sudden there’s that plume of heat and steam that comes out. Same thing happens on a fire. It also sucks in oxygen from all directions, puts fire and spot fires in all directions. That’s what happened yesterday.”
For days, the big question has been whether the Caldor fire will jump the large granite ridge that stands between it and populous South Lake Tahoe. Many residents hoped that the stony topography would act as a buffer.
In a Monday evening update, officials confirmed the fire had moved into Christmas Valley and Meyers, a town about seven miles south of South Lake Tahoe, and said so far, no structures in that area had been damaged.
Earlier that day, authorities  placed much of the area under an evacuation order — a worrisome indication that crews could be losing footing on the wind-whipped fire.Red flag warningsindicating gusty winds as strong as 35 mph have been issued across much of the fire zone.
Residents in some parts of the area closest to the fire, such as the Christmas Valley, were ordered to leave even sooner.
“The hardest part is to pack,” Carol Bin, 61, said from her driveway in the Christmas Valley this weekend. “Do I pack for a week? Or do I pack like I’m never coming back?”
California
As the destructive Caldor fire creeps closer to the popular resort area, the boaters, hikers and beach-goers who typically descend on South Lake Tahoe have all but vanished.
But the Caldor fire is only one of more than a dozen large fires burning in California, including some that have been churning through the landscape for weeks or even longer.
“One thing to understand is that there’s many other fires going in the state,” said Caldor fire unified incident commander Dusty Martin. “Not just in the north, but also in the southern part of the state. We’re all competing for the same resources.”
There are more than 15,000 personnel working on fires in California; the effort includes  nearly 1,200 fire engines, 315 hand crews, 367 dozer units, 411 water tenders and 111 helicopters, Mark Ghilarducci, director of the California Governor’s Office of Emergency Services, said Monday.
More than 43,400 Californians have been told to evacuate, he said.
“We know these are difficult times and we continue to be all hands on deck,” he said.
The assistance includes 1,059 California National Guard soldiers, sailors and airmen who are providing support to fire suppression operations that range from space-based platforms to boots on the ground, said Maj. Gen. Dave Baldwin. Most recently, 150 military police members were sent to help El Dorado County and the California Highway Patrol conduct traffic control points and secure evacuated areas, he said.
In addition, the National Interagency Fire Center has requested that about 200 active-duty U.S. Army personnel be deployed to serve as firefighting hand crews. The soldiers were scheduled to be trained over the next week and sent to fire lines in Northern California in early September, the agency said in a news release.
On of the state’s highest priority fires, the multi-county Dixie fire burning in Northern California, has long since claimed the title of thesecond largest wildfire in the state’s recorded history. On Monday, the fire was 771,183 acres and 48% contained.
It, too, promptednew evacuation warningsSunday, even as evacuation orders for other parts of the fire were reduced or lifted. Officials said crews on the Dixie fire would also contend with gusty red flag conditions through Tuesday.
“We have had some pretty strong winds today from the southwest gusting up to 27 mph,” Dixie fire meteorologist Mark Loeffelbein said Sunday. “Our relative humidity — something that tells us how much humidity is in the air — is something we watch very close on fires. That fell down to around 10% today, and I don’t think we have very much changing at least over the next 48 hours.”
The strong winds will also contribute to heavy smoke in some areas near the fire, including Susanville and Burney, officials said. Air quality in Chester will reach very unhealthy levels.
“Extreme fire behavior is expected,”  Cal Fire warned Monday morning.
Cal Fire officials deemed both the Dixie and the Caldor fires critical, with Porter on Monday noting that both blazes continued to display unprecedented behavior.
He noted that before this year, no fire was known to have burned from one side of the Sierra to the other. Both the Caldor and Dixie fire have now achieved that feat.
“Two times in our history and they’re both happening this month,” Porter said. “So we need to be really cognizant that there is fire activity happening in California that we have never seen before.”
California
The dryness of the vegetation, primed by both long-term drought and shorter-term heat waves, is making it easy for fires to ignite and even easier for them to spread.
Evacuation orders andwarningswerealso in placefor areas near the Chaparral fire, which ignited Saturday along the border of Riverside and San Diego counties.
That fire had grown to 1,427 acres and was 13% contained Monday morning, officials said. The blaze generated amassive fire whirlover the weekend that sent smoke and flames aloft.
At least two structures have already been damaged.
A nighttime acreage or containment update wasn’t available, but officials lifted evacuation warnings and downgraded evacuation orders to warnings for the portions of Riverside County affected by the blaze, state fire officials said.
All warnings and orders for San Diego County stayed in place, officials said.
“I can’t emphasize it enough that we are still meeting our responsibility to get fires put out at as small as possible size during initial attack and that early extended attack so we can continue to fight on these bigger fires,” Porter said.
Still, officials said, there is some concern that Southern California could start to see larger, more destructive fires as the season progresses, further straining resources already committed to the northern part of the state.
“We’re starting to see that drying trend,” said Tony Scardena, deputy regional forester for U.S. Forest Service Region 5.
California
Evacuations are ordered as the Caldor fire marches toward Lake Tahoe. Officials say fire dangers heightened this weekend due to winds and high temperatures.
Meanwhile, theFrench fire, in Kern County, and theMonument fire, in Trinity County, continued to challenge beleaguered fire crews, although firefighters were starting to gain some control. As of Monday morning, the French fire had grown to 25,264 acres and was 26% contained.
In aMonument fire update, Cal Fire officials said the state “has experienced large fire activity and will likely experience an extended fire season.”
“Fires burning in Northern California are exhibiting extreme fire growth based on critical fuel conditions,” they said. “Firefighters are experiencing conditions never seen before, such as increased rates of spread, spotting and active nighttime burning.”
As of Monday morning, the 164,746-acre Monument fire, which has been burning for 31 days, was 29% contained.

Intense winds pushed the fire toward the Lake Tahoe Basin, as firefighters fought to protect ski resorts, small towns and landmarks in its path. Officials had hoped to keep the flames out of the region, but conditions deteriorated as the day wore on.
In an evening update, officials confirmed that the fire moved into Christmas Valley and Meyers, a town about 7 miles south of South Lake Tahoe. Reports alsoemergedthat the fire was sweeping through a Tahoe-area ski resort, the Sierra-at-Tahoe, off U.S. 50 in Twin Bridges. It’s unclear how many structures were destroyed.

In the last few days, the fire has been spotting — or producing sparks that are carried by the wind and start new fires — about half a mile ahead of itself, but crews are expecting that distance to expand to more than a mile on Monday due to wind, he said.
“Our significant concern is that spotting,” he said. Specifically, crews were worried about “embers being blown from up at the ridge top landing somewhere down in the valley and taking hold.”
So far no structures in those areas had been damaged or destroyed, officials said.
Both areas had largely been evacuated along with South Lake Tahoe where those heading east into Nevada were caught in an hours-long traffic jam Monday afternoon.
Some said the road was more like aparking lotas people scrambled to leave town.
“For us, that was a good sign,” South Lake Fire Chief Clive Savacool said. “It meant our citizens were listening to the evacuation orders.”
Chris Anthony, a spokesman for the state’s Department of Forestry and Fire Protection, said Caldor remains a “very active” fire that officials expected to continue its march forward.
Citing factors including climate change and forest maintenance, Anthony said fires such as the Caldor were no longer an anomaly in the West, and said it was “resistant to control.”
California
The raging Caldor fire was within striking distance of the historic lodge tucked along Highway 50 on Saturday.
According to incident meteorologist Jim Dudley, winds that have been affecting the fire on the ground level will be aided by southwesterly winds aloft due to a changing weather pattern. Gusts on Monday were expected to be as strong as 35 mph.
Although there is still activity on the western perimeter, the majority of growth was on the fire’s northeastern edge, near the town of Strawberry and in the direction of the Lake Tahoe Basin, officials said. By Monday morning, the fire had seared 177,260 acres and destroyed 472 homes.
The fire was 19% contained Sunday morning, but the containment dropped to 14% on Monday morning. More than 20,000 structures are threatened, officials said.
Concern about the potential for disaster is mounting far beyond Tahoe’s typically emerald shores. The fire’s advance has alarmed President Biden’s administration, which has otherwise been preoccupied byHurricane Idaon the Gulf Coast.
“We are tracking the wildfires,” White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki said at a Monday press briefing. “We will continue to assess if additional resources are needed.”

“Therefore,” he said, “we resort back to our No. 1 priority: Get people out of the way and protect life.”
Officials urged people to obey evacuation orders and said those under evacuation warnings should gather important items such as medications and be prepared to take action if necessary.
“You need to be aware of what’s going on with the fire and try to keep yourself updated,” said Eric Lee, law enforcement liaison for the incident management team.

“We have a saying: Where water flows, fire goes,” fire behavior analyst Steven Volmer said.
Volmer said the probability of new fires as a result of spotting had been at 90% but that the probability would increase to 95% in the days to come.
Winds have long been the X factor in the state’s extreme fire behavior, officials said, so the forecast for the week could spell trouble for crews and for residents awaiting answers.
“We’ve had spotting occurring with these weaker winds,” said Henry Herrera, a public information officer for the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection. “So once they reach those [higher] speeds, there is potential for increased spotting, and for the spotting distance to increase as well.”
On Monday, Cal Fire Chief Tim Porter said the two fires that authorities have deemed critical — the Caldor andDixie fires— continue to display unprecedented behavior.
He noted that before this year, no fire was known to have burned from one side of the Sierra to the other. Both the Caldor and Dixie fire have now achieved that feat.

Caldor fire crews remain in ‘pretty good firefight’ as they brace for red flag conditions,https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2021-08-29/caldor-fire-crews-brace-red-flag-conditions,2021-08-30,"SOUTH LAKE TAHOE, Calif. —TheCaldor firemade a strong push east on Sunday toward Lake Tahoe, spreading rapidly and spurring more evacuations as fire crews braced for the arrival of gusty winds and hot, dry conditions.
Evacuation orders were extended  Sunday afternoon to include communities just south of South Lake Tahoe. All of the Lake Tahoe Basin in El Dorado County, from the California-Nevada state line on the lake’s southern end to Tahoma on its western shore, was under an evacuation warning by Sunday night.
The majority of growth and activity was on the fire’s northeastern edge, near the town of Strawberry and in the direction of the Lake Tahoe Basin, officials said. By Sunday afternoon, the fire had seared 168,387 acres and destroyed 472 homes. The fire was 19% contained Sunday morning, but the containment dropped to 13% by the afternoon.
Firefighters on Saturday made a substantial stand to protect Strawberry, including thehistoric Strawberry Lodge. Flames at one point were within feet of the town’s general store, but crews were able to keep them at bay by setting prescribed fires to burn fuel and attacking the blaze with fire hoses.

The raging Caldor fire was within striking distance of the historic lodge tucked along Highway 50 on Saturday.
But the biggest threat to the Tahoe Basin could be yet to come, as the National Weather Service hasissued red flag warningsindicating gusty wind conditions in the area from 11 a.m. Monday to 11 p.m. Tuesday.

Crews on Sunday were working hard and fast to get ahead of the shift.
“We have one more day of fairly light winds across the fire, and then things change later Sunday night, Monday, and they will continue into Tuesday,” Dudley said.

Residents in many areas near the fire are watching with concern and wondering whether  or when it is time to take action.
In the Christmas Valley — the first part of the Tahoe Basin to be placed under a voluntary evacuation notice — resident Carol Bin, 61, moved her horses to nearby Gardnerville, Nev., last week. She said she was hunkering down with air purifiers to protect against the fire’s thick yellow-gray smoke while she waited to see what the blaze would do next.
A former Big Bear resident, Bin said she has faced evacuations before. She wasn’t eager to do it again.
“The hardest part is to pack,” she said. “Do I pack for a week? Or do I pack like I’m never coming back?”

"Wildfire in Riverside County community grows to 1,200 acres, prompting evacuations",https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2021-08-28/wildfire-in-riverside-county-community-grows-to-1-200-acres-prompting-evacuations,2021-08-29,"A wildfire in the Riverside County community of La Cresta in the Cleveland National Forest has grown to 1,200 acres, prompting evacuations late Saturday, authorities said.
The blaze — dubbed the Chapparal fire — at Tenaja Road and Cleveland Forest Road began shortly after 12:30 p.m. Saturday, according to the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection and Riverside County fire officials. More than 250 homes are under mandatory evacuation orders while an additional 59 are under an evacuation warning.
Those under mandatory evacuation north of Tenaja Truck Trail, south of Calle Cielo, east of Calle Collado and west of Calle Be Bietol can find shelter at Murrieta High School, officials said.

At least 150 firefighters assisted by Cleveland National Forest and other local fire agencies are battling the blaze, officials said. The fire is 0% contained.
The hope  is to get the blaze under control before any possible wind shift occurs, said Rob Roseen, public information officer with the Riverside County Fire Department. The unincorporated community is nestled in the Cleveland National Forest.

The Caldor fire is moving in on Strawberry. Can its historic lodge be saved?,https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2021-08-28/caldor-fire-is-moving-in-on-strawberry-can-historic-lodge-be-saved,2021-08-29,"STRAWBERRY, Calif. —When Michael Hicks took ownership of Strawberry Lodge nearly 20 years ago, he knew fire was a possibility.
The historic lodge, tucked along Highway 50 in the tiny town of Strawberry, has burned three times since its first iteration in 1858, Hicks said.
But that history didn’t do anything to ease his concerns Saturday, as theraging Caldor fireburning near South Lake Tahoe moved within striking distance of Strawberry. Fire officials said  the northeastern front of the more than 149,600-acre blaze was within a mile and a half of the town, and crews were working hard and fast to lay containment lines in an effort to stop it.
“Hopefully they’ll be able to save at least the main building,” said Hicks, who evacuated to nearby South Lake Tahoe more than a week ago. “But it’ll depend on the firefighters and the winds, and we’ll see what happens.”
California
As the destructive Caldor fire creeps closer to the popular resort area, the boaters, hikers and beach-goers who typically descend on South Lake Tahoe have all but vanished.
Just above the snowline of the Sierra Nevada and about 30 miles from Tahoe, Strawberry Lodge has been a respite on the trek to the mountains since it was a Pony Express stop in the late 1880s, then catering to silver miners searching for their fortunes.
Though the years have taken their toll — the carpet is now worn and threadbare, and even the taxidermy bear fiercely greeting guests seems a bit tired — it is no less beloved to the locals and visitors who came more for the long, dim bar than for the accommodations.
And that bar was rarely empty. Weary parents from nearby Camp Sacramento, the city camp that drew generations of families year after year, would sneak in for a cocktail while counselors watched the kids. Winter sledders and summer rock climbers and mountain bikers would end their journeys with a burger and a beer, and residents of the tract of cabins that lined the nearby creek and American River gathered on cold nights near its stone fireplace, where kids could find board games and a cheap pool table.
But now the lodge’s history — and Hicks’ future — hang in the balance as the flames creep closer. A year shy of 70, he had finally decided to retire and put the family-run business up for sale. He’s in escrow with the new owners, he said, but no one is certain about what will happen next.
“It’s never good timing, but this was probably worse than most,” Hicks said.
Conditions in Strawberry on Saturday were nearly apocalyptic. The sickly yellow smoke spewing from the fire was thick enough to send even the bugs scrambling, and ash rained down on the lodge’s rusted sign.
Jay Smith, an information officer with the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection, said he was “cautiously optimistic” that Strawberry would be safe. There are about 500 cabins tucked into the surrounding forested hills, and protecting them is firefighters’ top priority.
“I’m pretty confident that we are going to be able to slow, if not stop that from coming this way,” Smith said.
Yet only minutes later, flames appeared at the top of a ridge behind him and quickly began working their way down the mountain. An hour after that, a spot fire ignited on the hillside abutting the lodge, sending fire roaring through the trees.
Hicks said the new buyers of the lodge — who planned to maintain much of its historic charm — have told him they were still interested in the purchase, although he was unsure whether they would feel the same way should the worst-case scenario occur. A representative for the buyer, an international real estate firm, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Managing the lodge has been both joyful and challenging as California’sclimate-driven conflagrationshave gotten worse, Hicks said. The cost of his fire insurance more than quadrupled from $22,000 to $92,000 over the last two years.
His eight employees have scattered due to the evacuation. He was only able to grab an armful of items before evacuating himself — leaving countless bits of hundred-year-old memorabilia to fate.
California
On the front lines of battle to keep Caldor fire from hitting Lake Tahoe
But many are rooting for the lodge and for Strawberry. David “Squirrel” Schlosser, who owns the general store across the street — virtually the only other business in the 50-person town — described it as a close-knit community where people are eager to lend a helping hand.
A 16-year resident of Strawberry, he said he “just kind of knew” wildfire was inevitable. He and his wife did all they could to clear defensible space around the store, as well as their  home a block away, before evacuating to a friend’s place in North Lake Tahoe.
“We did the best we can,” Schlosser said.
Now he and the rest of Strawberry’s residents and loyal visitors will have little choice but to wait.
On the Strawberry LodgeFacebook page, a post about the fire garnered more than 90 concerned comments from people who had visited with family and friends, including several people who posted photos of their wedding.
“Praying that they will save Strawberry Lodge that is part of our family history and the town,” one person wrote.
“Strawberry has a very special place in my heart; so many wonderful memories in my youth,” wrote another.On Saturday, those memories hung in the balance as firefighters worked to contain the encroaching flames. By dusk, the spot fire on the ridge had grown larger and was simmering its way in the direction of the property.
Firefighters were working fast, but sometimes Mother Nature has other plans.
“Hopefully they can save as much of the community as possible,” Hicks said. “But that, again, is up to the winds and the firefighters.”

"After a morning of progress, the Caldor fire makes gains toward Strawberry",https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2021-08-28/caldor-fire-lake-tahoe-progress-weather,2021-08-29,"STRAWBERRY, Calif.  —After a morning of steady progress against the massive Caldor fire in the mountains near South Lake Tahoe, strong winds on Saturday generated spot fires and new flame fronts that pushed the blaze closer toward the town of Strawberry.
Crews on the fire’s northeastern edge — the front closest to Tahoe  — were initially “cautiously optimistic”  as containment numbers increased for the first time in several days, from 12% to 19%, according to Cal Fire incident spokesman Jay Smith. The fire has so far burned  nearly 150,000 acres.
“It’s burning at a low intensity, so there’s not a huge wall of fire coming this way,” Smith said from the staging area in Strawberry, noting that crews were working fast to lay bulldozer lines and hand lines between the fire and the town. “I’m pretty confident that we are going to be able to slow if not stop it from coming this way.”
Minutes later, flames appeared at the top of a ridge behind him and began working their way down the mountain. An hour after that, a spot fire ignited on the hillside abutting thehistoric Strawberry Lodge, sending fire roaring through the trees.
California
The raging Caldor fire was within striking distance of the historic lodge tucked along Highway 50 on Saturday.
Caldor fire information officer Jason Hunter said the behavior was in line with afternoon wind patterns, which often increase fire intensity. When the spot fire met with strong winds, it generated “group tree torching,” he said.
But by dusk, firefighters were preparing to defend Strawberry’s general store, one of the town’s few businesses. It was something Hunter said crews were well-prepared for.
“It’s very unlikely” that the building will catch, he said, noting that engines were in place and firefighters were standing by with hoses on their shoulders.
“California is a beautiful place, and it’s heartbreaking to lose trees like this,” he said of the fire moving down the hillside. “But we choose to put as many resources as we can to protect the structures, and to do everything we can to protect the forest.”

On the front lines of desperate battle to keep Caldor fire from hitting Lake Tahoe,https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2021-08-28/on-the-front-lines-of-desperate-battle-to-keep-caldor-fire-from-hitting-lake-tahoe,2021-08-28,"STRAWBERRY, Calif. —Heading west on Highway 50 from the tiny town of Strawberry was an exercise in blind faith Friday, as even the nearest of pine trees were obscured by sickly yellow smoke spewing from the nearby Caldor fire.
Charred trees and fallen rocks dotted the roadside, and small spot fires seemed agitated by even the slightest hint of wind.
But, despite the eyeball-burning air, crews were working fast and hard with one major goal in mind: to prevent the raging, 143,000-acre fire from sweeping down into the basin of South Lake Tahoe.
“We’re trying to keep it west of [Highway] 89, and definitely trying to keep it from Lake Tahoe,” said Rosie Smith, an assistant engine operator with the U.S. Forest Service. “It’s just the extreme fire behavior that we’ve had over the last few weeks has made it difficult for us really to get ahead of the thing.”
Nearly 3,000 personnel are battling the fire, which remained only 12% contained Friday, and many are focused on the area near Lake Tahoe.
Crews along the road leading to Twin Bridges were laying handlines and driving  bulldozers through forested terrain, hardly seeming to notice the swirling ash and smoke. But in the stand to save Lake Tahoe, officials said there are several factors working in their favor — including less fire-friendly  topography, slowing winds and a large granite ridge between the town and the flames.
But climate-driven wildfire behavior has been so erratic this year that nearly anything is possible.
“Our winds are going to be lower today than they were yesterday, but we also have high temperatures and decreased humidity,” said Jason Hunter, a Caldor fire information officer. “We’re focusing a lot of efforts up here, a lot of resources on this side of the fire.”
As he spoke, simmering flames on the forest floor behind him caught a gust of wind and roared up the spine of a nearby tree. The stony ridge between the fire and the basin may be the best opportunity to get ahead of the blaze, he said.
“The granite gives us the benefit of less fuels, so it slows the rate of spread for the fire and gives us the chance to make a direct attack, potentially,” he said. But while the ridge could help slow the fire’s progress, it’s not impossible for the flames to jump it — especially if winds pick up again.
That’s why crews are also banking on topography to assist: The other side of the ridge is a downhill slope that leads into the Tahoe Basin, and wildfires don’t move downhill as quickly as they move up, Hunter said.
Also of potential benefit is a change in ecology, according to engine Capt. Mike Loeffler.
The fuel burns right through the manzanita brush, ponderosa pine and cedar trees that cover the area, Loeffler said. “Up there near the ridge, you’ve got a lot of fir trees and a lot more spare open areas because it’s a higher elevation. There’s more opportunities to try to catch [the fire].”
And while Tahoe remains a primary focus, crews also said the most imminent threat is to Strawberry, as well as about 50 cabins in a nearby tract of Eldorado National Forest, which they were working quickly to protect.
And while most were confident that they could get a handle on the fire before it reached more homes or structures, they also acknowledged that California’s fire season has been anything but predictable this year.
“We saw a big flare-up earlier, and we could feel the heat through our bus,” said Patrick McLaughlin, a firefighter with the Eel River crew of the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation. McLaughlin said the Caldor fire was his 25th fire in two seasons, and noted that it is hasn’t been uncommon to see embers  jump over hand or bulldozer lines, allowing the fire to spread.
Capt. Casey Hoffman with the El Dorado National Forest said firefighting work has been exceptionally busy the last five years as the state has gotten drier and hotter. “There’s a lot more fires, and a lot of wind-driven fires,” he said, as he leaned on his shovel for a brief rest before heading back downhill to the line. “Everything is receptive.”
But with Cal Fire Chief Thom Porter this week proclaiming the Caldor fire as the nation’s top priority, fire crews were optimistic that they will have the resources they need and the ability to prevent a worst-case scenario. They just hope they can find a way to turn that corner soon.
“We’re doing the best we can with what we have,” said Smith, the assistant engine operator. “There’s other forests that are having just as hard of a time, and there’s only so many of us.”

Book Club newsletter: ‘Breathing Fire’ in September,https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/books/newsletter/2021-08-28/book-club-newsletter-breathing-fire-jaime-lowe-book-club,2021-08-28,"Good morning, and welcome to the L.A. Times Book Club newsletter.
This month anew series of wildfiresravaged more than a million acres and destroyed entire communities in Northern California. Families there live in dread of evacuation orders — and of what will await them when the flames and smoke clear.
This terrifying siege is all too familiar to Californians in this era of drought, extreme heat and global warming.
What’s less well known is that the legions of firefighters battling theserunaway wildfiresinclude the growing ranks of women inmates from California prisons.
In her new book, “Breathing Fire,” journalistJaime Lowetakes readers to California’s fire lines through the experiences of inmates who volunteer for intense fire training and put their lives on the line to save a state in peril.
Lowe says the book was inspired by a2016 Times articleaboutShawna Lynn Jones, a 22-year-old inmate who was struck in the head by a large rock while working the fire lines in Malibu near Mulholland Highway. Jones, serving a three-year sentence for violating probation after a drug offense, died only six weeks before her release date.
For the next five years, Lowe set out to document the lives (and in Jones’ case, the death) of the women of the state’s Conservation Camp program: their stories, their training and the inequities of a system that paid Shawna Jones just$2.56 a day or $1 an hourfor working the fire lines.
Lowe joins book club readers Sept. 28to discuss “Breathing Fire” with Times columnistErika D. Smith, who also has written about thestate’s inmate firefightersand their struggles to earn a paycheck after prison.

New campsites at a fire-prone park in the dry Sierra? California just said yes,https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2021-09-30/california-state-parks-campsites-wildfires,2021-09-30,"California State Parks on Thursday unanimously approveda controversial planthat will allow up to 142 new campsites to be built in a crowded, wildfire-prone  park northeast of Sacramento.
The newgeneral planwill allow the building of up to 135 individual campsites and seven group sites within the Auburn State Recreation Area, which occupies 40 miles of steep river canyons and rugged terrain indrought-strickenEl Dorado and Placer counties.
The long-term planfaced vehement oppositionfrom residents of the Sierra Nevada foothills and from several local fire agencies who argued that new campsites will increase the fire danger for  visitors and nearby residents. Numerous small towns near the park can  be accessed by only a few steep mountain roads, leaving few evacuation routes if disaster strikes.
But State Parks said campsites have been proposed as an attempt to manage overcrowding and make the park safer.
“The pressures on public lands are greater than we have ever seen,” California State Parks Director Armando Quintero said during the virtual meeting of the state’s Park and Recreation Commission.
California
A wildfire-prone state park has been inundated with visitors as people flee urban areas. Now, California wants to build campsites there, infuriating nearby residents who say the plan puts them at risk.
Calling public outdoor spaces a “critical refuge,” Quintero said state officials are trying to accommodate more visitors than ever while adapting to climate change and increased wildfire danger in the state’s “overgrown forests” and “overgrown wildlands.”
Cal Fire has given much of the Auburn State Recreation Area itsmost extreme fire danger rating.
“Having a campfire in this canyon is absolutely insane,” said Sheila Reynolds, a resident of Auburn — a city of 14,000 people about  four miles west of the park — during public comments.
“We have already lost our home insurance because of our location, and you would be increasing the fire severity risk for people who live in Auburn.”
Visitation to the park — which is  in two of thefastest-growing countiesin California — is projected to increase 30% by 2040 because of regional population growth, according to the plan.
Trafficregularly backs upalong the two-lane Highway 49, a slow, steep drive with hairpin curves near the American River Confluence and several hiking trails. Cars park illegally along narrow shoulders. Hikers and bikers dash into oncoming traffic.
The situation  became so dangerous amid the coronavirus pandemic — as people have sought more outdoor activities — that  Auburnlaunched a bus servicethis spring to drive people between downtown and the river, and the parkhas restrictedparking in other areas where congestion threatened to block emergency vehicles.
There are currently 36 campsites in the park that usually sell out within minutes of becoming available for reservation.
The 717-page plan by the state and the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation does not authorize immediate construction of new campsites. Each new facility would require a site-specific plan and evaluation, including whether campfires should be allowed.
The commissioners added an amendment  requiring State Parks to ask the California Dept. of Forestry and Fire Protection to review and provide written comments each time a new facility is considered.
“What we heard a lot today from people is real, legitimate angst,” said Phil Ginsburg, vice chair of the Park and Recreation Commission, who proposed the amendment.
“Too many people in the state have been through hell as our planet gets hotter, and that manifests itself into increased fire danger and fire risk all throughout the state.”
Ginsburg said parks officials have two primary goals: creating “equitable access to recreation” and keeping people safe.
State parks officials said they believe visitors are less likely to create dangerous, illegal campfires or use fireworks in formally designated campgrounds, where they are more monitored.
Jim Michaels, a senior specialist with State Parks, said visitors are increasingly using undeveloped areas improperly, leading to more unsafe parking and unauthorized camping.
Over the last 20 years, he said, most fires within the parks — including thearson-causedBridge fire during Labor Day weekend — were the result of “negligent or illegal activities” and “were not ignited at developed recreation sites.”
Numerous fires have burned in and around El Dorado and Placer counties this summer, including the River fire, whichstarted in a campgroundnear the Auburn State Recreation Area and destroyed 142 structures; the massive Caldor fire, which decimated the town of Grizzly Flats andthreatened South Lake Tahoe; and the Bridge fire, which closed the main escape road for the town of Foresthill.
John Michelini, board president of the Foresthill Fire Protection District, was one of several speakers who told the commission he fears what happened with the 2018 Camp fire. With few paths in and out of the town of Paradise, thousands of people trying to flee were stuck in traffic, and somedied in their vehiclesas flames roared over them.
“Remember Paradise,” he said.

Looking for fall colors? Head to these places in the Eastern Sierra,https://www.latimes.com/lifestyle/newsletter/2021-09-30/la-the-wild-9-30-21-the-wild,2021-09-30,"Early October isthetime to head to the Eastern Sierra to find fall color in California. National forests that closed earlier this month because of fire danger have reopened and (hopefully) will stay that way during leaf-peeping season. Here are three places along Highway 395 to put on your list.
Lake Sabrina:CaliforniaFallColor.comreports that Sabrina Lake at 9,150 feet and the upper areas of Bishop Creek Canyon are quickly approaching peak colors. The aspens along the lakeshore change from green to greenish yellow to gold. Skies have been hazy because of smoke from wildfires but winds may clear the air, the website said. Also, expect low water levels at the lake because of the continuing drought. From Bishop, drive 18 miles on California 168, past the tiny mountain town of Aspendell, to the lake’s edge.
June Lake: This year’s fires have blackened many areas near Lake Tahoe and other parts of the state. Happily,the June Lake Loop(a.k.a. California 158), part of theInyo National Forest, remains a sweet spot for scenery. The loop’s 16 miles take you past June Lake (about 7,650 feet), Gull Lake, Silver Lake and Grant Lake, offering the changing colors of cottonwoods, willows, quaking aspens and their reflections. From Highway 395, take California 168. (Check out the full list of top 40 fall destinations in California.)—Christopher Reynolds
McGee Creek Canyon: Aspen trees that line McGee Creek can turn vivid yellow and sometimes orange; shrub-like willows along the water’s edge add pale yellow hues. Both bring color to this remote canyon between Bishop and Mammoth Lakes that’s best explored on foot. Drive from Highway 395 up a steep, winding four miles to the trail head and park.Modern Hiker describes the entire 6.6-mile routewith about 1,200 feet of elevation gain. But you can hike in just a few miles to see whether colors are popping. Turn off Highway 395 at the north end of Crowley Lake and onto McGee Creek Road until the road ends (the last mile is dirt).
For updates, go to theCalifornia Fall Colorwebsite to find out which spots are about to pop and which are past peak.

Worried about getting bit by mosquitoes? You should be.Aedes(pronounced “ay-ee-deez”) mosquitoes invaded California in the early 2000s and have become peskier every year since.
Sophie Parker, lead scientist for theNature Conservancy, writes in an L.A. Times opinion piece:“Aedes albopictus, the Asian tiger mosquito, was the first to arrive, introduced in shipments of ornamental bamboo. In 2013, breeding colonies ofAedes aegyptimade their way to California after successfully inhabiting the southeastern United States. Scientists have also observedAedes notoscriptusin the state. All three species have spread diseases such as dengue fever and Zika virus in other countries.”
Why do these exotic pests like Southern California? Because irrigated Mediterranean landscapes in our yards, lawns and parks provide just enough water for them to reproduce and thrive.
There’s a way to fight back without resorting to pesticides: Plant native flowers and shrubs that don’t require so much water.Read more about why it’s important to make the shift.
Native plants represent only about 3% of nursery sales in California, a figure theCalifornia Native Plant Societyhopes to boost to 20% over the next three years.
The plan? Sell indigenous plants in more places and teach the public how to grow them. To get gardeners started, the society selected 11 species to be sold at more than 75 nurseries statewide starting Oct. 1. Fall is the perfect time to plant natives too. Species include oaks, manzanita, toyon, clarkia, currants, iris, mint, phacelia, yarrow, sage and ornamental grass.Here’s what they’ll look like in your garden.

A pre-event competition was added last week: cubs. “If you love looking at round baby bears (and how could you not), then the next few days are your Super Bowl, as Alaska’s chunkiest cubs face off for the title of Fat Bear Junior,”Backpacker magazine wrote in an explainer story.
Fattening up for winter is important for bears. Katmai National Park & Preserve started Fat Bear Week in 2014 to better educate people about how bears live and thrive.
The oldest known human footprints in North America can be found at White Sands National Park in New Mexico. Scientists last week revealed that fossilized prints found in white gypsum fields (which give the park its name) are at least 23,000 years old — thousands of years older than previously thought. How did they date the prints? By radiocarbon dating ancient grass seeds that were found above and below the layers of earth where the footprints were found.More info here.

"Federal response to wildfires must change, Forest Service chief says",https://www.latimes.com/politics/story/2021-09-29/the-federal-response-to-wildfires-must-change-forest-service-chief-says,2021-09-29,"WASHINGTON —The U.S. Forest Service needs to hire more firefighters and reconfigure how it mitigates the risk of wildfires that are growing more intense, the head of the agency told lawmakers Wednesday.
This year “has been devastating in not only the size and frequency of large wildfires but also in terms of sustained activity,” U.S. Forest Service Chief Randy Mooretestifiedat a hearing before the House Subcommittee on Conservation and Forestry.
Moore blamed the severity of recent fire seasons on extreme drought, a warming climate and a century of “overly aggressive suppression policies” that have made forests ripe for more destructive fires.
About 46,000 fires have burned nearly 6 million acres across the West this year, destroying 4,500 structures and killing four federal firefighters, Moore said.
About27,000firefighters have been deployed by the federal government to fight wildfires this year, but they are still stretched thin. The problemreached a critical pointover the summer with aburst of early wildfiresin the West amid extreme staffing shortages. A combination of low pay, competition from state and local fire departments, and exhaustion from longer and more destructive fire seasons has left federal agencies scrambling to fill positions.
“We have seen highly trained personnel leave the Forest Service; we have experienced some inability to recruit new employees; and we are in a constant mode of training new employees,” Moore said in prepared testimony.
Climate & Environment
“Our forests are really in a state of crisis. What we’re seeing now should be a call to action.”
The Biden administration this yearboostedthe minimum wage for federal firefighters from $13 to $15 per hour, enabling the federal government to attract firefighters in states such as California and Washington, where pay was higher.
“Federal wages for firefighters have not kept pace with wages offered by state, local and private entities in some areas of the United States,” Moore said in written testimony. “Firefighters must be fairly paid for the grueling work they are willing to take on.”
Moore told The Times last week that “we’ll never be able to hire enough firefighters to fight our way out of what’s going on on the landscape. We’re seeing conditions out there that I have not seen in my 40-plus years of working for this agency.”
Last year, Californiarecorded its largest fire season ever.The severe effects these fires have on communities are partly due to the approach American officials have historically taken to eliminating fires.
Before Europeans colonized North America, many Western forestsbenefitedfrom frequent, low-intensity fires caused by lightning and Indigenous peoples’ burning practices, experts say. After colonization, U.S. officials instead aggressively suppressed fires,upendingthat beneficial cycle and helping to create an imbalance that makes wildfires more dangerous and more intense.
The Forest Service chief told lawmakers that his agency would instead focus on mitigating the effects of wildfires by more aggressively treating forests before fires begin. Such treatments include thinning underbrush and debris and clearing dead branches and trees to reduce potential fuel for blazes. Moore testified that such treatments near Lake Tahoe helped stop the spread of the Caldor fire last month, saving homes and lives.
Moore said that about 66 million acres need to be treated but that it could be nearly as effective to focus on 20 million critical acres over the next decade.
“We must actively treat forests,” he said. “That’s what it takes to turn this system around.”
Rep. Jim Costa (D-Fresno) said at the hearing that West Coast forests are “in a crisis mode” and that there is no longer a fire season but a fire year. The federal government needs to devote more money to the Forest Service to help it shift away from fire suppression to prescribed treatments, he said.
“If we continue in this way,” Costa warned, “I don’t think we are ever going to deal with the crisis or provide the forests with the proper management they deserve.”

"Sizzling temps, Santa Ana winds will descend on Southern California, raising fire risk",https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2021-09-29/sizzling-temps-santa-ana-winds-will-descend-on-southern-california-raising-fire-risk,2021-09-29,"Southern California’s brief taste of fall is coming to a scorching halt.
Temperatures across the region are expected to soar 10 to 20 degrees this week as dry Santa Ana winds blow in from the northeast, elevating fire risk — a stark turnaround from cooler conditionsearlier in the week.
Downtown Los Angeles will hover in the upper 70s on Wednesday before leaping to nearly 90 degrees on Thursday, which is about 10 degrees higher than average.
The region could see temperatures 10 to 15 degrees above average over the weekend, with some areas hitting close to 100 degrees, according to the National Weather Service.
Burbank, typically topping out at 83 degrees this time of year, could reach 96 by Saturday.
Big changes are coming to#SoCalover the next 48 hours. Much warmer and drier. Expect temperatures to climb 10 to 20 degrees, and humidities to drop 25-50%. (corrected graphics from previous tweet)pic.twitter.com/5PIW67JeIk
Seasonal winds arriving in the mountains and valleys are forecast to peak  Thursday, reaching 15 to 25 mph in the San Fernando, Santa Clarita and Ventura County valleys, with some gusts up to 40 mph.
Winds in L.A. County mountains are expected to be stronger, averaging 20 to 30 mph and isolated gusts reaching 45 mph.
From Nevada, the air will be forced over mountains before plunging into the Los Angeles Basin.
“As it does so, it warms up and it dries out,” said David Sweet, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service’s Oxnard station.
Humidity is expected to drop by 25% to 50% this week.
“The low humidities that will accompany the winds and the warm temperatures will give us at least elevated fire weather conditions,” Sweet said, with potential to briefly reach “critical.”
Sweet expects the highest fire risk will come Thursday, when winds pick up.
Warmer, drier weather could increase fire behavior for the KNP Complex and Windy fires rampaging in the southern Sierra Nevada, as the twin blazescontinue to expand, fire officials said. Together, the fires have seared more than 136,000 acres after burning for roughly three weeks in dense, forested terrain.
Containment of the Windy fire — now 87,901 acres — jumped significantly overnight to 25%, up from just 6%, with recent cooler temperatures believed to have curbed growth in some areas. Higher pressure moving in will “bring us seasonably warm and much drier conditions for the remainder of the week,” said Philomon Geertson, a fire weather meteorologist trainee assigned to the Windy fire.
Given the forecast, Ernie Villa, an operations section chief trainee for the blaze, said during a briefing Wednesday that fire personnel would be “keeping an eye” on a section along the east end of the fire, west of Fairview. The fire is burning in the Tule River Indian Reservation and Sequoia National Forest.
Not far to the north, the KNP Complex fire — in Sequoia National Park — was 48,872 acres and 11% contained on Wednesday morning.
Parts of Northern California are also seeing increased fire danger due to gusty winds and poor humidity recovery, with a red flag warning issued for the North Bay Mountains, primarily affecting Napa County and areas along the Sonoma County border.
The warning will go into effect at 11 p.m. Wednesday and expire at 11 a.m. Thursday, and the strongest winds are expected to blow after midnight through 10 a.m.,  according to the National Weather Service.
North and northeast winds are forecast to average 15 to 25 mph, with gusts between 25 to 35 mph. The weather service warned in an advisory: “Any new fire starts will likely show moderate to rapid growth.”
Firefighting resources have been stretched thin by nearly a dozen large wildfires ravaging the central and northern parts of California, scorching more than 2.4 million acres this year.
The Angeles National Forest was among several Southern California forestsclosed until last weekbecause of fears that fires could be sparked, with limited personnel to battle them.
California
A temporary closure of California’s national forests canceled long-planned trips and local hikes. Will it become the new normal?
Years of drought have primed the state’s vegetation toburn faster and hotter— a problem firefighters are contending with up and down the state.
Southern California so far this year has avoided the large conflagrations seen in other parts of the state. But much of the region’s dry vegetation hasn’t yet encountered severe winds like theSanta Anasstarting to arrive.
As officials sound alarms, some people who pulled out sweaters earlier this week might be scratching their heads.
Behind the dramatic reversal in conditions is a ridge of high pressure building from the southwest, driving up the mercury and banishing clouds, according to Sweet.
It’s supplanting a low-pressure system that earlier this week brought cooling, a thick marine layer and even some light precipitation in some coastal areas.
Temperatures began to rise modestly Wednesday, and low clouds and fog were scant.

"Strong winds fanning Windy, KNP Complex fires as they burn through southern Sierra Nevada",https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2021-09-28/strong-winds-fan-growing-windy-knp-complex-fires,2021-09-28,"Gusty winds blowing through the southern Sierra Nevada continue to spread the growing KNP Complex and Windy fires, which have burned more than 135,000 acres combined as they tear through steep, rugged terrain.
Furious westerly winds — some gusting up to 40 mph — fanned the Windy fire’s growth by nearly 2,000 acres in a day. The fire, raging in the Sequoia National Forest and Tule River Indian Reservation, had ballooned to 87,318 acres on Tuesday and was only 4% contained.
The KNP Complex fire, burning to the north in the Sequoia National Park, had  burned through 48,344 acres and was 8% contained.
Both fireserupted Sept. 9amid a massive lightning storm that sent dozens of bolts shooting into the dense forest, home to groves ofgiant sequoia trees, including the famedGeneral Sherman tree. Since then, they haveexpanded rapidlythrough the drought-stricken vegetation.
Toxic smoke from the twin blazeshave shrouded skiesandtriggered air quality warningsmore than 100 miles away.
California
That gray-orange haze in the air is mostly wildfire smoke blowing in from the Windy and KNP Complex blazes burning in the southern Sierra Nevada.
“If you had told me 2½ weeks ago that at this point, we would be less than 10% containment, I probably would’ve said, ‘Well, I’m not sure I want to hear that.’ But here we are,” said Clay Jordan, superintendent for the Sequoia and Kings Canyon National Parks.
During a community meeting Monday, Jordan said fire officials were wrestling with “very difficult decisions,” weighing firefighters’ lives and communities at risk from the blazes.
Because of the extreme steepness of the terrain and hazards posed by standing dead trees — known as snags — firefighting efforts have included significant amounts of indirect attacks, such as building containment lines, officials said.
“You can place firefighters in there, expose them to great risk, and have very little chance of success,” Jordan said. “You just can’t justify that level of risk.” The downside is that with indirect methods, “the matrix of containment is not a good measure of progress,” he said.
California
Track wildfire origins, perimeters and air pollution with the L.A. Times California wildfires map.
The benefits of indirect work can take a while to show, said Jim Mackensen, a public information officer for the Windy fire, who said intense fire behavior and rough terrain have often made direct firefighting techniques infeasible.
An infestation ofbark beetlesa few years ago killed a large number of drought-weakened trees, felling them and strewing their parched carcasses on the ground.
“When the fire gets into those areas, it sets all those logs and stuff on fire, so it’s got a tremendous amount of energy,” Mackensen said. “We can’t put firefighters right on the line to fight those fires.”
In many instances, crews instead have backed away from the edge of the fire and put containment lines off roadways or dozer lines while waiting “for the fire to come down closer to us,” Mackensen said. He said he expected containment on the fires to increase over the next several days as the flames reach those lines.
Roughly 158 homes in the Sequoia National Park, in the Lodgepole area, and nearby communities of Three Rivers and Hartland are threatened by the KNP Complex. Personnel were prioritizing protecting those structures Tuesday, officials said.
Meanwhile, crews from Tulare County were assessing potential damage to homes and other properties in the Sugarloaf and Pine Flat areas, along the south end of the Windy fire, where flames swept through in recent days.
Climate & Environment
In California and beyond, some people are deeply in grief, stunned that flames could again imperil some of Earth’s oldest living things.
Despite fire officials’ cautious optimism that indirect firefighting methods will pay off, albeit more slowly, there’s general consensus that both the KNP Complex and Windy fires will continue to swell.
Years of drought have primed the state’s vegetation toburn faster and hotter— a problem firefighters are contending with up and down the state.
A winter and spring oflittle rainand minimal snow runoff — followed by months of unusually warm conditions and severalsummer heat waves— left wildlands primed to burn fast, giving fire crews little time to get a handle on flames before they explode.
And adding to fire experts’ concerns is the fact that much of the dry vegetation this year hasn’t yet encountered severe winds, which tend to arrive in the form ofSanta Anasand sundowners later in the year.
When the extreme dryness does meet strong winds it can quickly spell disaster.

Fawn fire arson suspect said she was boiling creek water to remove bear urine,https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2021-09-28/fawn-fire-arson-suspect-tried-boiling-creek-water-remove-bear-urine-day-blaze-began,2021-09-28,"A Palo Alto woman facing felony charges of arson in connection with a wildfire burning in Shasta County told authorities she was trying to boil bear urine out of creek water the day the fire started, according to a criminal complaint.
Alexandra Souverneva, 30, is accused of “willfully, unlawfully, and maliciously” setting fire to forest land in the Mountain Gate area near Redding on Wednesday,  igniting the Fawn fire, which  hasdestroyed 185 structuresand forced the evacuation of thousands of residents.
She faces afelony arson chargewith an enhanced charge of committing arson during a state of emergency. Together, the charges could result in up to nine years in prison, Shasta County Dist. Atty. Stephanie Bridgett said. She has pleaded not guilty.
Souverneva told Cal Fire officials that she was hiking to Canada when she became thirsty and found a puddle of water near a dry creek bed, according to court records. The water contained bear urine, Souverneva said, and after an unsuccessful attempt to filter it with a tea bag, she tried to start a fire to boil the water instead. But, she said, “it was too wet for the fire to start.”
She drank the water anyway and continued to walk uphill, she told authorities, until she saw smoke and “airplanes dropping pink stuff” and then contacted the fire department.
Quarry workers reported seeing a woman matching Souverneva’s description who was “acting irrationally” near where the fire began Wednesday afternoon. Court documents indicate the woman continued walking east into the vegetation, leaving behind two carbon dioxide cartridges and a battery along a dirt road.
Later that night, fire officials found Souverneva as theybattled the growing blazeand assessed her for possible dehydration. At the time, she was carrying a functioning cigarette lighter and a “pink and white item containing a green leafy substance she admitted to smoking that day,” Cal Fire Officer Matt Alexander reported.
She also was carrying carbon dioxide cartridges that matched the ones found near the quarry, according to the criminal complaint.
California
Alexandra Souverneva, 30, of Palo Alto, was charged with arson in connection with the 8,500-acre fire.
In addition to arson charges, Souverneva, who was appointed a public defender, could face additional charges as the Fawn fire continues to burn. She remains in custody in lieu of $150,000 bail.
“We are still waiting to get the final damage assessment to know what the extent of structural damage … before we can decide whether we can file additional charges,” Bridgett said Tuesday. “I will say that additional charges are probably likely based on what I know so far.”
Fire officials think Souverneva may also be responsible for a vegetation fire in Shasta Lake City that ignited the previous evening. And Bridgett said she may be linked to other fires in both the county and elsewhere in California.
“It is my experience that arsonists are responsible for multiple fires and will light multiple fires in a short timeframe,” Alexander wrote in the complaint.
Arson arrests have not been uncommon in California this year. Cal Fire Battalion Chief J.T. Zulliger said  the Shasta-Trinity unit of Cal Fire has made 14 arson arrests this year, and there have been 103 such arrests statewide.
“We are still in critical fire danger and ... we ask the public to be extremely careful and cautious having to do with any kind of outside activity that may spark a fire,” he said. “We still have a long way to go until the rains come.”
The Fawn fire has nowburned more than 8,570 acres, leading Gov. Gavin Newsom on Monday to declare a state of emergency in Shasta County.
The blaze grew steadily for several days, but by Sunday night, officials said itsforward progress had been stopped. On Tuesday morning, it was 65% contained, according to the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection.
Despite the containment, mandatory evacuation orders remain in place, and fire crews were preparing for potential heavy winds that could carry embers  and start spot fires.

How to watch Jaime Lowe discuss ‘Breathing Fire’ at the L.A. Times Book Club,https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/books/story/2021-09-28/breathing-fire-jaime-lowe-book-club-erika-smith,2021-09-28,"California has always had a fire problem; now that problem is a constant crisis.
Among California’s solutions is a nearly invisible workforce of inmate firefighters. Depending on the year, inmates make up as much as 30% of California’s wildland fire crews, saysauthor Jaime Lowe.
In her new book, “Breathing Fire,” Lowe takes readers to the front lines of California’s wildfires through the experiences of the women inmates who volunteer for intense fire training and risk their lives to save a state in peril.
Lowe joined the L.A. Times Book Club Sept. 28 for a conversation with Times columnist Erika D. Smith. You can watch the  live-streaming event onYouTube,TwitterandFacebook.
Lowe says the book was inspired by a2016 Times articleabout Shawna Lynn Jones, a 22-year-old inmate who was struck in the head by a falling boulder while working the fire lines in Malibu. Jones, serving a three-year sentence for violating probation after a drug offense, died just six weeks before her release date.
For the next five years, Lowe set out to document the lives of the women of the state’s Conservation Camp program: their stories, their training and the inequities of a system that paid Shawna Jones just$2.56 a day or $1 an hourfor working the fire lines.
“Breathing Fire” is the September selection of theL.A. Times Book Club. In October the paper’s community book club will be reading “The Boys” by Ron and Clint Howard, who join book club readers on Oct. 15 at L.A. Live’s Rooftop Terrace.Get tickets.

"On the climate crisis, delay has become the new form of denial",https://www.latimes.com/opinion/story/2021-10-31/climate-crisis-delay-has-become-the-new-form-of-denial,2021-10-31,"Whether it’s the apocalyptic wildfires that once againravaged Californiaand the West this summer, aheat domeover the Pacific Northwest that made parts of Canada feel like Phoenix on the Fourthof July or thedevastating floodsin my state of Pennsylvania after Hurricane Ida dumped months’ worth of rainfall in a few hours, it is clear that dangerous climate change is upon us.
One can no longer credibly deny that climate change is real, human-caused, and a threat to our civilization. That means that the forces of inaction — the fossil fuel interests and the front groups, organizations and mouthpieces-for-hire they fund — have been forced toturn to other tacticsin their effort to keep us dependent on fossil fuels.
These tactics includedeflection(focusing attention entirely on individual behavioral change so as to steer the societal discourse away from a discussion of the needed policies and systematic changes),division(getting climate advocates fighting with each rather than speaking with a united voice), and the promotion ofdoomism(convincing some climate advocates that it’s too late to do anything anyway).
But the D-word du jour is delay. And we’ve become all too familiar with the lexicon employed in its service: “adaptation,” “resilience,”“geoengineering”and “carbon capture.” These words offer the soothing promise of action, but all fail to address the scale of the problem.
Adaptation and resilience are important. We must cope with the detrimental effects of climate change that are already baked in — coastal inundation and worse droughts, floods and other dangerous weather events. But if we fail to substantially reduce carbon emissions and stem the warming of the planet, we will exceed our collective adaptive capacity as a civilization.
Whenfossil fuel-friendlyRepublican Sen. Marco Rubiotells Floridiansthat they must simply“adapt”to sea level rise (how? By growing fins and gills?), he’s trying to sound  as if he’s got a meaningful solution when, in fact, he’s offering only empty rhetoric and a license for polluters to continue with business as usual. It’s a delay tactic.
What about geoengineering? Should we engage in an enormous, unprecedented and uncontrolled experiment to further intervene with our planetary environment by, for example,shooting sulfur particulates into the stratosphereto block out the sun in hopes of somehow offsetting  the warming effect of increasing carbon pollution?
The law of unintended consequences almost certainly ensures that we willscrew up the planeteven more. The idea of geoengineering also grants license for continued carbon pollution. There’s a reason Rex Tillerson, former ExxonMobil CEO and Donald Trump’s secretary of State, hasdismissedthe climate crisis as simply an “engineering problem.” If we can simply clean up our act down the road, why not continue to burn fossil fuels? This, too, is a delay tactic — one that buys time for polluters to continue to make billions in profits as we mortgage the future habitability of the planet.
And what about “carbon capture” and the promise of “net zero” emissions by mid-century? Reaching zero emissions by 2050 will indeedbe necessaryto avert catastrophic planetary warming of more than 1.5 degrees Celsius. But it is hardly sufficient. We must also cut emissions in half by 2030 to hold warming below the danger limit of 1.5 degrees Celsius. Merely committing to the former, but not the latter, is like making a New Year’s resolution to lose 15 pounds without any plan to alter your diet and exercise regimen in the months ahead.
Furthermore, understand that the “net” in “net zero” is doing quite a bit of work, for implicit in the word is the notion that we can continue to burn fossil fuels if we can find a way to remove them just as quickly. To quote Will Smith’s Genie in the movie “Aladdin,” there’s “a lot of gray area” in that word. It allows politicians to make vague promises of technological innovation, i.e., carbon capture, that would potentially remove billions of tons of carbon dioxide a year from the atmosphere in the future. Yet there is no precedent for deploying such technology on such a massive scale.
It’s really easy to put carbon pollution into the atmosphere but really hard to take it back out and safely bury it for the long term. Nonetheless, the promise of carbon capture and net zero emissions decades from now allows politicians to kick the can so far down the road you can barely see it. That’s another masterful delay tactic.
Look no further than Australia, a country that deserves better than the feckless coalition government that currently reigns. The parties therehave reluctantly and conditionallyagreed only to the weak commitment of net zero emissions by mid-century. And their commitment to reduce carbon emissionby a paltry 26% to 28%by 2030 is half what other industrialized nations such as the U.S., Britain and the European Union have committed to.
A newly released report based on leaked documents shows that the Australian governmentsought to water downan upcoming U.N. climate recommendation to phase out coal- and gas-fired power stations. Saudi Arabia and Russia — two countries thathave worked tosabotage international climate action in the past — have made a mockery of the current climate negotiations by agreeing onlyto a laughably delinquent2060 date for reaching net zero emissions.
Even countries that have made bold commitments are still suffering from an “implementation gap” that must be closed, a disconnect between what they’ve promised and what they’re currently delivering. The Biden administration is currently hampered by Sen. Joe Manchin, acoal-state Democratwho stands in the way of the administration’s clean energy agenda. The E.U. and Britain, meanwhile,are flirting withnew oil and gas pipelines even as the International Energy Agency has said there can beno new fossil fuel developmentif we are to avert catastrophic warming.
The U.N. climate summit in Glasgow can still lay outa path forward, if a narrow one, to a livable clean energy future. But we cannot afford to fall victim to delay tactics. We must hold our policymakers accountable for representing the public interest rather than polluting interests. This is the last best opportunity for averting climate disaster.

Net zero: Australia’s Scott Morrison and his climate change balancing act,https://www.latimes.com/world-nation/story/2021-10-29/australia-scott-morrison-climate-change-balancing-act,2021-10-29,"MELBOURNE, Australia —Freak storms, catastrophic bushfires, debilitating drought. Australia knows about extreme weather.
But when hailstones recently struck northern Queensland, just as the government’s junior party was debating a plan to reduce greenhouse emissions, it seemed like a sign from above. The 6-inch chunks of ice pounded cars and shattered windshields.
Days later, the government, with historic support from the junior National Party, endorsed Prime Minister Scott Morrison’s goal of achieving net zero emissions in 2050. Morrison could be a leading voice to replace the world’s reliance on fossil fuels such as oil and gas with cleaner alternatives such as solar or hydrogen.
Instead, he’s headed to theUnited Nations Climate Change Conferencethat begins Sunday in Glasgow, Scotland, with a policy light on detail and soundly criticized by many Australians, from scientists to politicians, as leaving other countries to do the heavy lifting asgreenhouse gas emissionsandglobal temperatureskeep rising.
Australia won’t shut down coal or gas production or exports and there will be no job losses in farming, mining or gas as a result of the international push to address climate change, Morrison told reporters while presenting the plan.
“It’s an energy, trade and economic plan, not just an environmental plan,” he said. “It is not a revolution, but a careful evolution to take advantage of changes in our markets.”
Australian coal not only contributes to the emissions produced domestically, but its fossil fuel export industry — one of the largest in the world — contributes to emissions produced by other countries. It ranks last of 31 wealthy developed countries for its emission performance, according to the research groupClimate Council.
Net zero refers to balancing the greenhouse gas emissions going into and coming out of the atmosphere.
Australia’s current 2030 target aims to cut emissions by 26%-28% below 2005 levels, a target that climate experts and other countries say is too low. Morrison said his country is on track to beat the target and reduce emissions by 30% to 35%. That’s considerably short of the 50%-52% target  announced byPresident Bidenin April for U.S. emissions by 2030.
While Australia is a big exporter of carbon-rich fossil fuels, it is also a big and growing exporter of low-carbon new-energy metals needed to replace fossil fuels. It is well placed to benefit from growing demand for metals such as nickel, copper, lithium and cobalt.
Government subsidies for solar energy have led to Australians adopting rooftop solar panels so enthusiastically that the grid operator has had to bring forward plans to upgrade the grid to prevent blackouts.
But adoption of electric vehicles, which can lead to lower carbon emissions, trails other developed nations even though Australia is the world’s biggest exporter of the lithium used in the batteries of vehicles.
When he left for Glasgow on Thursday, Morrison fended off a suggestion from the UK hosts of the conference, known asCOP26, that Australia make a more ambitious contribution to the 2030 target.
“We’ve got a plan for Australia. They’ve got a plan for the UK,” Morrison said.
Morrison has been seen as a supporter of the fossil fuel industry at least since February 2017, when, as treasurer, he brandished a lump of coal in Parliament and told lawmakers how the mineral had made Australia one of the wealthiest countries in the world.
The former marketing executive – derisively called “Scotty from marketing” by his critics – won leadership of the conservative Liberal Party and the government when Prime Minister Malcom Turnbull was deposed in a party room battle in 2018. Morrison led the party to a narrow victory in 2019, in part on a promise to take a cautious approach to climate change policies.
“What is important is that I act consistent with the mandate I had from the Australian people,” he told reporters.  “They rejected a 45% target at the last election. They endorsed a meet-and-beat target of 26 to 28%, which is what we’ve done.”
In the run up to the climate change conference, politicians, comedians and princes have urged Australia to do more. Comedian Dan Ilic crowdfunded a campaign to take out advertisements in Times Square, mocking Australia’s track record; Prince Charles diplomatically urged Morrison to attend COP26.
The net zero plan Morrison is taking to Glasgow will not look impressive among the 38 nations in the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development, said Jeremy Moss, a professor of political philosophy at the University of New South Wales.
This “last-minute commitment to net zero will leave Australia more closely aligned with Saudi Arabia than the U.S. and Europe,” Moss said, referring to the Middle Eastern country that is the world’s biggest oil exporter. Saudi Arabia has said it will reduce carbon emissions to net zero by 2060 although it doesn’t plan to stop producing oil.
“Australia has lost an opportunity to show how a wealthy democratic country can transition away from dependence on fossil fuel exports,” Moss said.
Apart from not shutting down coal and gas, Morrison’s plan pledges $20 billion in technology investments expected to unlock at least $80 billion of private and public investment in clean hydrogen, carbon capture and storage and energy storage.
Mike Cannon-Brookes, the Australian U.S.-based billionaire and co-founder of software company Atlassian, said Australia’s plan paled in comparison to the UK proposal, which details pathways for every sector to 2037.
Morrison’s plan is meaningless without strong action this decade, Simon Bradshaw, the head of research at the Climate Council, said in an email. The organization favors Australia reducing its emissions by 75% by 2030.
When Morrison says his strategy is about “technology, not taxes,” it’s a reference to the legacy of the impact of climate change policies on Australian politics. Policies to reduce emissions — like a carbon emissions trading scheme or a carbon tax — have been seen by lawmakers to be a threat to jobs and incomes that could cost them votes in elections.
Morrison became prime minister after Turnbull’s plan for an energy and climate change policy made Turnbull unpopular within his party.
National Party support, stemming from the vast Australian countryside where mining and farming are strongholds, is crucial for Morrison if he is to win an election due in the next 12 months. The partnership between the Liberal Party Morrison now leads and the Nationals has lasted 75 years.
The opposition Labor Party led Morrison’s Coalition 54%-46% in a poll published in the Australian newspaper in late October.
Representatives of Australia’s most popular European car, Volkswagen, say it is becoming the biggest seller of affordable EVs everywhere but in Australia because of the government’s failure to adopt tighter restrictions on vehicle emissions such as those required in Europe.
Australia is “an automotive dumping ground for auto engines that our competitors cannot sell in other markets,” said Volkswagen Australia’s Managing Director Michael Barstch. The continued lack of federal leadership on EVs and its aversion to setting emissions targets means “Australia languishes in the automotive third world,” he said.
The Australian government’s climate approach, even after the National Party’s endorsement of Morrison’s plan, means it risks being left behind, particularly as other regions act more resolutely and investment increasingly seeks “green” criteria, some observers say.
“The advantage of adopting meaningful 2030 emission reduction targets now is that the economy won’t be littered with stranded fossil fuel assets in the future,” Moss said.

Sean Penn’s CORE group faces labor charges over impassioned internal email,https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2021-10-29/sean-penns-core-group-facing-labor-charges-over-impassioned-internal-email,2021-10-29,"The National Labor Relations Board has filed a formal complaint against actor Sean Penn’s nonprofit disaster response organization over claims that Penn implicitly threatened employees who criticized conditions at aDodger Stadium COVID-19 vaccination site.
The lawyer who brought the charges said an internal email from Penn to his employees amounted to coercive conduct that could negatively affect young workers. Lawyers for the Oscar-winning actor are insisting that the claims are frivolous and without merit and are calling for their dismissal.
Penn’s nonprofit group, Community Organized Relief Effort, or CORE, assisted the city of Los Angeles at the mass vaccination site in January, earning praise for taking action during a critical moment in the pandemic when the city wastransitioning from testing to vaccination.
But Penn and CORE quickly came under scrutiny after two anonymous commenters left disparaging remarks on a New York Times message board about the working hours and food provisions at the site.
The comments spurred Penn to write an impassioned, 2,200-word email in which hechastised the commenters.
“And to whoever authored these, understand that in every cell of my body is a vitriol for the way your actions reflect so harmfully upon your brothers and sisters in arms,”Penn wrote in the email, which was promptly leaked to The Times. “I have taken counsel and here will refrain from using the words with which I would otherwise choose to describe the character of your actions.”
The email also encouraged those who were unwilling to do the work to quit.
California
Sean Penn strikes back after two people who claim to work for his nonprofit assisting at the Dodger Stadium vaccination site criticize the operation.
The words caught the eye of Los Angeles labor lawyer Daniel B. Rojas, who petitioned  the NLRB to investigate whether the remarks constituted an unlawful threat.
Rojas said Friday that he was particularly concerned because many of CORE’s employees at Dodger Stadium were young people and people of color.
“When I read Mr. Penn’s letter, I flagged the contents as unlawful and became upset about the notion that, due to the impetuous conduct of an ultra-wealthy man, hundreds of young people in L.A. would be coerced into believing that discussing wages or working conditions with third parties is incompatible with continued employment in the nonprofit sector,” he said via email.
The NLRB’s complaint, dated Oct. 25, sided with  Rojas, charging that Penn had “impliedly threatened” employees with reprisals and discharge during his screed.
But Penn and CORE are pushing back. Their attorney, Mathew Rosengart, confirmed Friday that the group refused a settlement offer with the NLRB based on the “utter lack of legal merit” of the charges, and noted that no CORE employees or unions protested Penn’s statements.
“CORE and Mr. Penn completely stand by his email, and the NLRB’s actions to distract CORE from its crucial mission for a case where no employees were harmed, are shameful,” he said in a statement, adding that the group will “vigorously contest and fight the baseless charge in the legal system.”
Rosengart said the comments from Penn’s email were “cherry-picked” and failed to account for the larger context, which also included ample praise for CORE’s employees and vivid descriptions of Penn’s own distress during the deadly winter surge of COVID-19.
The email in question was a “rallying cry to CORE’s employees, profusely thanking them and expressing great pride for their hard work and lifesaving, emergency services,” he added.
The anonymous comments that drew Penn’s ire were attached to aNew York Times storyabout the Dodger Stadium vaccination site, and might have disappeared into the ether of the Internet were it not for his response.
One commenter took issue with the story’s description of “Krispy Kreme for breakfast and Subway for lunch” for site workers.
“We usually DON’T get breakfast, just coffee,” the commenter wrote. And the lunch is “NOT” Subway, but “the same old lettuce wraps every day.”
The other, a self-described CORE staff member, said that in order to comply with Mayor Eric Garcetti’s push to switch the site’s operations from COVID-19 tests to vaccinations, employees worked 18-hour days, six days per week, “without the opportunity to take breaks,” a claim Penn’s camp denied.
Attorneys for Penn also noted that CORE was working closely with and at the behest of the city. Penn said in his email that the city did not order CORE staff to work excessive hours, but acknowledged that the “extraordinary staff and volunteers” strived to meet a “quantifiable urgent need” during a critical inflection point in the pandemic.
“You rose up. You did. Not me. All of you. And I will admit something. It made me weep. Not with some stupid self-presumed sense of fatherly pride, but simply a human pride in experiencing that people like you exist,” he wrote.
Reached by phone, Rojas said he was not able to confirm whether the anonymous commenters were actual CORE employees, but noted that “the NLRB considered that as an issue and decided that it doesn’t matter,” because employees were the ones who received his email.
Readers rise to the defense of actor Sean Penn, who wrote a scathing response to criticism of his group’s vaccination efforts.
Penn, a polarizing figure in Hollywood, founded CORE after the destructive and deadly 2010 earthquake in Haiti. The group continues to work in Haiti and has since provided humanitarian aid after hurricanes in North Carolina, Florida, Puerto Rico and the Bahamas.
During the pandemic, the group helped run dozens of COVID-19 testing sites across the country.
CORE relies on a small amount of government funding and on charitable donations, including a $30-million contribution from Twitter founder Jack Dorsey, CORE co-founder and Chief Executive Ann Leesaid in an interview last year. Penn takes no salary from the group, according to its federal tax filings.
Rojas said he was hopeful that CORE would “reconsider its position, manage a bruised ego and settle the case,” noting that the remedy for the violation does not involve a monetary settlement  but instead an agreement to cease and desist from further violations, an official declaration of wrongdoing and a notice to affected employees.
“Simply put: I filed the charge because it’s protected activity, not ‘broad-based cyber whining,’ to discuss your wages or working conditions with the public,” Rojas said. “This is particularly true where an employer — like CORE — is reliant on public funds. These are our tax dollars at work.”
Yet Rosengart similarly characterized the charges as a waste of federal resources and taxpayer dollars and said it is distracting CORE from its mission. The group has helped administer nearly 6 million COVID-19 tests and 2.5 million vaccinations in Los Angeles and around the world with a focus on underserved, low-income groups and communities of color, he said.
Jennifer Abruzzo, general council for the NLRB, said in a statement Friday that although CORE “engages in important and admirable work, like all employers, it must respect the right of its employees under the National Labor Relations Act to engage in protected concerted activities, such as discussing matters of mutual concern with one another and bringing workplace concerns to the public, federal agencies, or other third parties.”
A hearing before an NLRB administrative law judge is slated for January  in Los Angeles.

Newsom abruptly cancels plans to attend U.N. climate change summit,https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2021-10-29/newsom-abruptly-cancels-plans-to-attend-un-climate-change-conference,2021-10-29,"SACRAMENTO —Gov. Gavin Newsom abruptly canceled plans on Friday to lead a  California delegation to next week’sUnited Nations Climate Change Conferencein Scotland, citing “family obligations” for the reason he is bowing out.
Newsom had been preparing for the trip to Glasgow for several weeks, saying California provides an  example to the world that a state can be committed to fighting global warming while still thriving economically.
No further details were provided. Newsom had planned to attend the conference with his wife, documentary filmmaker Jennifer Siebel Newsom.
“Due to family obligations, Governor Newsom will no longer be traveling to the 2021 United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP26) and will instead be participating virtually, focusing on California’s landmark climate change policies,” Newsom’s spokesperson, Erin Mellon, said in a statement Friday morning.
Lt. Gov. Eleni Kounalakis will be attending the conference in Newsom’s place, his office said.
The rest of California’s official delegation to the 26th gathering of the Conference of Parties, or COP26, will still be attending the event along with heads of state, environmental activists, business leaders and journalists.
The contingent includes Assembly Speaker Anthony Rendon (D-Lakewood) and more than a dozen other state lawmakers. The Newsom administration also will be well represented and will include Newsom’s senior climate advisor, Lauren Sanchez, state Environmental Protection Agency Secretary Jared Blumenfeld, state Natural Resources Agency Secretary Wade Crowfoot and California Air Resources Board Chair Liane Randolph.
The governor had planned to urge world leaders to take immediate  action on climate change and stress that the time for debate about doing so is over, Sanchez said in a recent interview. She added that Californians already are grappling with the changing climate and reliance on fossil fuels, citing massive wildfires, mega droughts andoil spills.
“We know that impacts around climate change are being felt differently around the world. California really gets to stand up and say, the crisis is here. It’s not 2050. It’s not 2100,” Sanchez said. “It is impacting the way Californians live and move and the air they breathe today.”
The governor was scheduled to lead a delegation of state lawmakers and environmental leaders to “make the case that the state needs national and international partners to join us in committing to safeguard our future,” according to an earlier statement put out by the Newsom administration.
Newsom was expected to emphasize California’s plans tophase out the sale of new gasoline-powered automobilesby 2035 and the state’s economic transition away from fossil fuels. On Tuesday, Newsom was expected to join with heads of state and representatives from major car companies to discuss the role of the growing electric vehicle market in addressing the  effects of climate change.
“No other state of America comes close to our leadership in that space,” Newsom told reporters on Wednesday during a news conference in Oakland.
Long a national leader on progressive environmental issues, California is working to achieve economy-wide carbon neutrality by 2045. Last year, Newsom called to ban the sale of new gas-powered vehicles in the state by 2035.
In April, Newsom took action to ban new permits for hydraulic fracturing starting in 2024, halting the controversial oil extraction method that’s been targeted by environmental activists for years.
And just last week the Newsom administration moved towardbanning new oil and gas wellswithin 3,200 feet of homes, schools and healthcare facilities.
“We don’t see oil in our future,” Newsom said when making the announcement.

Glasgow is the moment to go big on climate change. But Biden is stymied by Congress,https://www.latimes.com/opinion/story/2021-10-28/climate-change-glasgow-congress,2021-10-28,"Over the summer, as the world reeled from record-breaking heat waves, flooding and wildfires, the United Nations issueda climate change reportthat connected the dots with terrifying clarity.
The world has moved too slowly to stop global warming and the increase in extreme and deadly weather events. But with radical action to cut carbon emissions over the next decade, we can still prevent the worst devastation.
Next week will test if world leaders are ready to act with the urgency this moment requires. Government officials, business leaders and environmentalists will gather in Glasgow, Scotland, for a two-week summit tohammer out new commitmentsto slash planet-warming emissions.
The COP26 conference is expected to be the most important climate event since 2015, when global leaders met in Paris and promised to cut their greenhouse gas emissions enough to stop the planet from warming more than 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial times. But nations haven’t done nearly enough to meet the Paris agreement target, so at this follow-up conference in Glasgow, world leaders will be expected to present concrete plans for how they intend to fulfill the promise.
It’s not that people don’t care about global warming. It’s just that they don’t seem to care in rational proportion to the enormity of the problem.
As of now, the Biden administration is going to Scotland with a weak plan that mostly relies on incentives to encourage emissions reductions but without the mandates or penalties to ensure the reductions actually happen — all because obstructionists and fossil fuel loyalists in Congress gutted President Biden’s most aggressive climate change programs.
That’s a disappointment because all eyes will be on the United States. President Biden has laid out an ambitious climate change agenda, including a goal to cut the nation’s greenhouse gas emissions  50% from 2005 levels by 2030. But the U.S. will never meet that target on pledges alone. It will take aggressive policies to reduce the nation’s reliance on fossil fuels to keep the lights on, power vehicles and heat homes.
It’s deeply frustrating that one of the most important pieces of Biden’s climate agenda — a plan to reward utility companies that use clean energy sources and penalize those that don’t — was yanked from the Build Back Better bill to coax a “yes” vote from  Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin III from the coal-producing state of West Virginia. (Not a single Republican is expected to vote for the spending package, so Manchin’s support is essential. So much for theConservative Climate Caucus.)
Instead, Biden’sBuild Back Better plannow relies on $555 billion in tax credits and incentives to encourage companies and consumers to invest in clean energy. That will still be a huge help. If passed, it would be the largest single federal investment in climate change in history. Biden said all that spending could get the U.S. to hit its climate targets. (Though someexperts are skepticalthe president’s revised strategy will be enough.)
Politics
Thousands will attend the U.N. global climate summit. While hopes for a major breakthrough are slim, here’s what leaders hope to get done.
While Congress is inching closer to approving the Build Back Better plan’s tax credits and temporary spending, the nation really needs laws and programs that require utilities and energy companies to rapidly phase out fossil fuels. We’ve seen what happens when Congress refuses to be more aggressive.President Obama had to rely on incentives, executive orders and slow-moving regulatory processesto tackle climate change. But those efforts were rolled back by President Trump and the U.S. lost critical time and credibility in fighting global warming.
This is the moment when the world’s industrialized nations need to step up with real policies and programs that make real reductions in greenhouse gas emissions. The U.S. is doing a lot, but if the world is going to avoid greater devastation from climate change, we need to be doing much more, much faster.

Search for missing L.A. woman leads to Castaic landfill,https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2021-11-29/search-for-missing-woman-heidi-planck-leads-to-castaic-landfill,2021-11-30,"The tortuous search for a missing Los Angeles woman has led investigators to a landfill in Castaic, police said Monday.
Heidi Planck, 39, was last seen Oct. 17 at a luxury apartment building on South Hope Street in downtown L.A., according to the Los Angeles Police Department. Her former husband, Jim Wayne, reported her missing three days later when she failed to pick up their son from school.
In the days and weeks that followed, the case generated headlines and raised eyebrows as investigators gathered leads. By Oct. 29, it had been turned over to the LAPD’s Robbery-Homicide Division, with Wayne at one point voicing concerns about his former wife’s position working for ahigh-profile wealth management executiveunder investigation by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.
Police said Monday that Planck’s dog was found inside the Hope Street apartment building, where she did not live.
“Forensic evidence was located inside the building which has led detectives to believe an incident occurred resulting in Planck’s death,” the LAPD said in a statement.
An LAPD spokesperson would not elaborate Monday on what evidence was found or how Planck may have died. In early November, her Range Rover was found in the underground parking garage of a residential building several blocks away.
Reached by phone Monday, Wayne said Planck had been at their son’s football game in Downey the day she was last seen, but she left at halftime and seemed “a little antsy.”
“I just remember her saying, ‘I’ve got to leave,’” he said.
He couldn’t think of any connections she may have had to the building on Hope Street but said the dog’s microchip is what helped lead police there.Video footageshowed her walking the dog in an alley nearby. The dog was found loose on the building’s 29th floor, Wayne said.
Officials said the search at Chiquita Canyon Landfill in Castaic could take up to 10 days to complete.
“The ultimate outcome would have been to find her,” Wayne said. “Now it’s recovering her remains, and that in itself is just so sad on so many different levels, and so awful and so ugly.”
Waynepreviously told reportersthat he thought Planck’s disappearance could be connected to her job as a financial controller at Camden Capital Partners. Her boss, Jason Sugarman, isfacing SEC chargesfor his alleged role in a scheme to bilk $43 million in client funds intended for Native American tribal bonds.
Attempts to reach Sugarman on Monday were unsuccessful.
Sugarman’s father-in-law, Peter Guber, is chief executive of Mandalay Entertainment and co-owner of several sports teams, including the Dodgers and the Golden State Warriors.
Wayne also said the SEC had contacted him four days after Planck’s disappearance to ask about Sugarman and the company. Later,security footagefrom Planck’s Mid-City home appeared to show Sugarman leaving muffins on her doorstep after her disappearance.
Business
Jason Sugarman, a minority owner of the popular Los Angeles Football Club and son-in-law of Hollywood mogul Peter Guber, has been accused of participating in an elaborate scheme that defrauded investors in tribal bonds of some $43 million.
But on Monday, Wayne said he did not want to continue to speculate about who may have been involved in Planck’s disappearance, even though he felt Sugarman was “more worried about where his laptop was” than Planck’s whereabouts.
The LAPD has “really dug deep, and I’ve got to take a back seat and let them do their job,” he said.
Police said they have no information on a suspect.
Aerial footage of the Chiquita Canyon Landfill on Monday showed heavy machinery digging amid the dry dirt.
Landfill officials said in a statement that they were “fully cooperating with investigators” and following all health and safety protocols.
Wayne said that “there’s somebody out there for sure” who knows what happened and that he hoped anyone with information would come forward.
Few need resolution more than their son, he said.
“An 11-year-old boy needs to know what happened,” he said.

"Father charged after 4 children, mother-in-law shot to death in Lancaster home",https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2021-11-29/woman-4-children-found-shot-to-death-in-lancaster-home,2021-11-30,"A single-story home on a quiet street in Lancaster became a scene of tragedy Sunday night when a father shot and killed his four children and their grandmother, authorities said.
Germarcus David, 29, was arrested on suspicion of murder Monday morning in connection with the killings, said Deputy Trina Schrader of the Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department. He is being held in lieu of $2-million bail.
The Los Angeles County district attorney’s office on Tuesday charged David with five counts of murder and three counts of assault on a child causing death. He was expected to be arraigned later in the day.
Police responded to calls of an emergency at the home in the 3500 block of Garnet Lane around 10:30 p.m. Sunday, officials said.
When they arrived, they found four children — all age 12 or younger — and a woman in her 50s, all with gunshot wounds to their upper bodies.
All five were pronounced dead at the scene by paramedics.
Prosecutors identified the children as Namyiah David, 11; Germarcus David Jr., 7; Kayden David, 2; and Noah David, 1. Their grandmother Ericka England, 51, also was killed.
Property records show the home where the bodies were found belongs to the suspect and Tyanna Brown.
David is a licensed security guard who has held three firearm permits since 2012, according to the California Bureau of Security and Investigative Services. His most recent permit, issued in August 2018, was listed as “cancelled” after it expired in August 2020, officials said.
Waki Jones said he has been working with the family for the last several years, regularly dropping the older  children off at elementary school and day care. He first learned they had been killed when he came to pick them up Monday morning.
“Someone told me or I asked which house where the shooting was, and then I don’t remember anything after that,” Jones said when reached by phone. “They were just good kids.”
He said that he did not know David well but that the two would sometimes talk about taking care of children. David recently promised to take the kids fishing, but Jones said the children told him the plans fell through.
Jones said he has been a day-care provider for several years and always treats children as if they were his own.
“To do this to the kids, it’s cowardly. It’s just unbelievable,” he said.
California
According to an investigation by The Times, the theft of 44 guns from an L.A. gun store has spurred a cascade of allegations against LAPD officers and a roiling department scandal.
On Monday, yellow caution tape blocked off Garnet Lane, where some sparse Christmas decorations dotted nearby lawns.
Angelo Beltran, who lives a few doors down from the house where the shooting took place, said she heard screaming late Sunday.
“We saw a woman screaming outside, and we don’t know who she is, but she was yelling,” Beltran said.
Grace Beltran, who lives in the same home, said she heard a woman yell, “My babies are gone.”
Marco Estrada, 49, is staying with his niece five houses away and said he would sometimes walk his dog around the neighborhood and see a man sitting on the front porch of the house.
“He seemed nice, quiet. You wouldn’t think much of him,” Estrada said.

"To protest COVID mandates, this California town declared itself a ‘constitutional republic’",https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2021-11-29/la-me-california-covid-mandates-constitutional-republic,2021-11-29,"OROVILLE, Calif. —For Oroville Vice Mayor Scott Thomson, the father of two young boys, Gov. Gavin Newsom’s mandaterequiring schoolchildren to be vaccinatedagainst COVID-19 was the final straw.
He believed the government had no right to tell him what to put into his, or his children’s, bodies. Many of his constituents agreed when it came to pandemic mandates.
And so, he came up with a grandiose, headline-grabbing nom de guerre for his small Northern California city.
Oroville declared itself a constitutional republic. A place where the local leaders pledge to fight mandates they say go too far.
“Any executive orders issued by the State of California or by the United States federal government that are overreaching or clearly violate our constitutionally protected rights will not be enforced by the City of Oroville against its citizens,” readthe declarationpassed this month by the City Council.
“The desire here is dialogue,” Thomson said.
For some, the declaration was a stand for freedom. But others in town saw it as a reckless tantrum amid an ongoing pandemic that has killedmore than 73,000 Californians.
Butte County, population about 220,000, has one of the state’slowest vaccination rates. As of Saturday, 47% of its residents were fully vaccinated, compared with 64% of all Californians.
Butte County’s largest hospital, the 298-bed Enloe Medical Center in Chico, has averaged 26 COVID-19 patients over the last week —more than all but one hospitalin Los Angeles County, home to 10 million people.
Oroville resident Celia Hirschman lost her father, former San Francisco poet laureateJack Hirschman, to COVID-19 three months ago. She said the resolution insults people who have lost loved ones or are immunocompromised, just to score political points.
“It says we’re cowboys, and we’re not going to live by your rules,” she said. “I don’t think it’s about open dialogue at all. I feel it’s a dangerous measure that they have no business adding to our charter.”
Oroville, a city of 20,000, is now one of a growing number of rural California communities in recent years to label itself a sanctuary or a place otherwise exempt from some liberal ideal.
Two years ago, the desert town of Needles becamea “sanctuary city” for the 2nd Amendmentin a rebuke of California’s strict gun-control laws. And in defiance of pandemic shutdown orders, the Central Valley towns of Atwater and Coalinga last year declared themselves, respectively, a “sanctuary city for business” and a town where all businesses are essential — with bothlosing emergency COVID-19 fundingin the process.
Designed to benefit from the buzz of California’s “sanctuary” designations used in the context of protecting undocumented immigrants, the labels reflect tensions between rural towns andthe Newsom administration— and the left in general.
Oroville’s constitutional republic resolution is mostly symbolic, with no power over schools, which are regulated by the state.
The town is the county seat of Butte County —a purple countywhere 36% of voters are registered Republicans, 35% are registered Democrats, and 20% are independents. By close margins, the county voted for President Trump in 2016 and President Biden last year. Voters heresupportedthe attempted recall of Newsom.
COVID rates have remained relatively high here, even as they eased significantly in places like Los Angeles and San Francisco. The number of COVID-positive patients during the Delta variant surge, most of whom were unvaccinated, peaked at Enloe Medical Center on Sept. 23, when there were 95 people hospitalized with the virus. Now, the new Omicron variant looms as a potential threat.
“This is a difficult place to be, going into the winter,” said Marcia Nelson, the hospital’s chief medical officer. “We’re not starting from a baseline of under 10 patients; we’re starting from a baseline of what used to feel like a really high number.”
At theOroville City Council meetingat which the constitutional republic resolution was approved, a city staffer had to clarify to one commenter that the resolution was not “beginning the effort for Oroville to secede from California and from the Union.”
One speaker was an older man who compared the resolution to the decades-oldState of Jefferson movement, which calls for California’s rural, conservative northern counties to secede and form their own state.
“These ‘constitutional republic’ people would probably prevent mask mandates,” the man said, citing the county’s vaccination rate. “In other words, they’re looking to kill people.”
The audience broke out in laughter. When the resolution passed, they cheered.
Thomson said the impetus for the declaration was vaccine mandates, especially the one for schoolchildren, which has been opposed bymultiple Butte County school districtsand has sparked protests across the state, includingin cities like Los Angeles.
“Now that the mandates have gone from not just putting something on the outside of your body or modifying how you run your business, but now shoving something inside your body that nobody knows the long-term effects of, that’s just like, OK, now you’re, in my opinion, crossing the line,” Thomson said.
Thomson, the pastor of an Assembly of God church, said he is not anti-mask or opposed to the vaccine for people who want it. He said he and his sons are not vaccinated but that they now have antibodies after a mild bout with COVID-19 in August.
“There are people out there who are like, ‘This whole thing is a hoax,’” Thomson said. “We are not like that, just being reckless.”
He said that unvaccinated city employees are tested weekly for COVID-19 at the city’s expense. And his church has handed out hundreds of masks to congregants.
Council members said they have been inundated with calls and emails about the resolution — positive and negative — from across the country.
“There’s been a lot of expletives,” said Eric Smith, a councilman and president of the Oroville Chamber of Commerce.
Smith said most local business owners support the declaration. He said the broad pandemic closures were a hard pill to swallow because they came amid what has been a local “fiscal renaissance” and growing population in recent years.
It’s been “a tightrope,” he said, to have “a balanced approach to concerns about the disease and spread and people’s livelihoods.”
Councilwoman Krysi Riggs said she cast the sole no vote against the declaration because she believed the best way for city leaders to push back against mandates is through the judicial system, not through a resolution. But, she said, she understands the frustration with the mandates.
“We’ve been in this situation for 20 months, and I think the general feeling is fatigue,” she said. “When does this come to an end? Yes, there are some lights at the end of the tunnel, but those come with uncertainties and risks as well.”
The pandemic, she said, added to what has already been five years of disaster for Oroville. There was the 2017failure of a spillwayat the Oroville Dam that led to mass evacuations; the 2018 Camp fire in nearby Paradise;the droughtthat forcedthe shutdownof a major hydroelectric power plant at Lake Oroville in August.
When wildfires broke outacross Butte County last summer, the smoky air in Oroville was toxic — but indoor dining was banned across the state because of the virus, leaving local restaurants in a bind, Riggs said.
“It’s been a yo-yo of what’s acceptable and what isn’t,” she said.
Brian Wong, who opened the Union Bar & Grill in Oroville in fall 2019, said he thought the city’s statement about the mandates was “very courageous.”
As a small-business owner, Wong said he felt like he had to navigate complicated and ever-changing state rules on his own.
“You felt angry, you felt weak. For a whole year, it was nothing but fear and anger going through this whole system,” he said. “Seeing politics creep into all of it, it felt like they were not being sincere about health and safety.”
Wong, who also owns the 109-year-old Chinese restaurant Tong Fong Low, said he spent a lot of money to build a patio for outdoor dining and required his dozens of employees to wear masks for more than a year, until vaccines became widely available.
He has heard all views about the pandemic from his customers and said he welcomes diverse perspectives. That’s why he named his restaurant Union, because it’s his vision of California: “a coming together of all these different people to make up the whole.”
Parked down the street from Union, Joseph Tomlinson, a 24-year-old chef, said he opened his burger truck, Joe’s Lunch ToGo, in March 2020, just as the pandemic was starting.
Tomlinson had not heard much about the constitutional republic declaration, but he figured it couldn’t hurt if it pushed for more local control. He said when he and his employees masked up and required social distancing, he received no harassment from customers.
“We never had any Karens,” he said. “We are a small town, and we support each other.”
But sitting outside his downtown antique store, Gold City Mercantile, Michael Suplita laughed and rolled his eyes when asked about Oroville being a constitutional republic. He responded with a quintessential “dad” joke: “As far as I’m concerned, a mandate is when two men go out to dinner.”
As for the declaration?
“It’s all just talk,” Suplita said. “We’re the new city that says, ‘We don’t have to do whatever you say.’ Sure, OK.”

‘So many memories’: Over 500 homes feared destroyed by Colorado fire,https://www.latimes.com/world-nation/story/2021-12-31/wildfires-burn-homes-in-colorado,2022-01-01,"SUPERIOR, Colo. —One couple returned home Friday to find the mailbox about the only thing left standing. Charred cars and a burned trampoline lay outside smoldering houses. On some blocks, homes reduced to smoking ruins stood next to ones all but unscathed by the flames.
Colorado residents driven from their neighborhoods by a terrifying, wind-whipped wildfire got their first, heartbreaking look at the damage the morning after, while others could only wait and wonder whether their homes were among the more than 500 feared destroyed.
At least seven people were injured, but there were no immediate reports of deaths or missing people in the aftermath of theblaze outside Denver.
Cathy Glaab found her home in the town of Superior where she lives with her husband had been turned into a pile of charred and twisted debris. It was one of seven houses in a row that burned to the ground.
“The mailbox is standing,” Glaab said, trying to crack a smile through tears. She added sadly, “So many memories.”
Despite the devastation, she said they intended to rebuild the house they have had since 1998. They love that the land backs up to a natural space, and they have a view of the mountains from the back.
Rick Dixon feared there would be nothing to return to after he saw firefighters try to save his burning home on the news. On Friday, Dixon, his wife and 21-year-old son found it mostly gutted with a gaping hole in the roof but still standing. Only smoldering rubble remained where several homes once stood in a row immediately next to theirs.
“We thought we lost everything,” he said, as he held his mother-in-law’s china in padded containers. They also retrieved sculptures that belonged to Dixon’s father and piles of clothes still on hangers.
The wildfire erupted Thursday in and around Louisville and Superior, neighboring towns about 20 miles northwest of Denver with a combined population of 34,000.
Tens of thousands were ordered to flee as the flames, propelled by gusts up to 105 mph, swept over drought-stricken neighborhoods with alarming speed.
At a Costco in Superior, two store employees came running toward the checkout lines, one of them shouting, “Everyone evacuate, evacuate, evacuate!” said Katrina Peterson, who was inside.
A video she made showed dark skies and whirling debris outside. The falling ash filled her ears, and she had to squint to keep it from getting in her eyes. The store was left standing.
The cause of the blaze was under investigation. Emergency authorities said utility officials found no downed power lines around where the fire broke out.
With some roads still closed Friday, people walked to their homes to get clothes or medicine, turn the water off to prevent the pipes from freezing, or to see whether they still had a house. They left carrying backpacks and pulling suitcases or wagons down the sidewalk.
David Marks stood on a hillside overlooking Superior with others, using a borrowed pair of binoculars and a long camera lens to see whether his house, and those of his neighbors, were still there, but he couldn’t tell for sure whether his place was OK. He said at least three friends lost their homes.
He had watched from the hillside as the neighborhood burned.
“By the time I got up here, the houses were completely engulfed,” he said. “I mean, it happened so quickly. I’ve never seen anything like that. … Just house after house, fences, just stuff flying through the air, just caught on fire.”
By first light Friday, the towering flames that had lit up the night sky had subsided and the winds had died down. Light snow soon began to fall, and the blaze, which burned at least 9.4 square miles, was no longer considered an immediate threat.
“We might have our very own New Year’s miracle on our hands if it holds up that there was no loss of life,” Gov. Jared Polis said, noting that many people had just minutes to evacuate.
The fire broke out unusually late in the year, following an extremely dry fall and amid a winter nearly devoid of snow so far.
Boulder County Sheriff Joe Pelle said more than 500 homes were probably destroyed. He and the governor said as many as 1,000 homes might have been lost, though that won’t be known until crews can assess the damage.
“It’s unbelievable when you look at the devastation that we don’t have a list of 100 missing persons,” the sheriff said.
The sheriff said some communities were reduced to just “smoking holes in the ground.” He urged residents to wait for the all-clear to go back because of the danger of fire and fallen power lines.
Sarah Owens, her husband, adult son and their dog got out of their Superior home within 10 minutes of learning about the evacuation from a Facebook post. But as everyone tried leaving by way of the winding streets of the well-to-do Rock Creek neighborhood, it took them 90 minutes to go two miles.
“The good news is I think our house may be OK,” Owens said.
But from now on, she said, she plans to have a bag packed in case of another fire.
“I never thought a brush fire could cause this kind of destruction,” Owens said. “I want to stay here. No matter where you live, there are always going to be natural disasters.”
Superior and Louisville are filled with middle- and upper-middle-class subdivisions with shopping centers, parks and schools. The area is between Denver and Boulder, home to the University of Colorado.
Scientists sayclimate change is making weather more extremeandwildfires more frequent and destructive.
Ninety percent of Boulder County is in severe or extreme drought, and it hasn’t seen substantial rainfall since mid-summer.Denver set a record for consecutive days without snowbefore it got a small storm on Dec. 10, its last snowfall before the wildfires broke out.
Bruce and Mary Janda faced the loss of their Louisville home of 25 years in person Friday after learning it had been destroyed through a neighbor’s photos.
“We knew that the house was totaled, but I felt the need to see it, see what the rest of the neighborhood looked like,” Bruce Janda said. “We’re a very close-knit community on this street. We all know each other and we all love each other. It’s hard to see this happen to all of us.”

Is wildfire arson getting worse in California? Climate change doesn’t help,https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2021-12-31/is-wildfire-arson-getting-worse-in-california,2021-12-31,"A college professor. A Caltech grad. A woman in a bikini. And, just this month, a father and son.
A confounding collection of Californians have been accused of contributing to one of the worst wildfire seasons in state history — a season that saw three killed, thousands of homes leveled and more than 2.5 million acres burned.
While fires ignited by downed power lines and lightning have caused widespread destruction in recent years, this last wildfire season was unusual for the number of large fires that were linked to arson. Wildfire arson arrests have been climbing over the last few years: In 2021, the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection reported 140 arrests by its  law enforcement division — 20 more than last year anddouble the numberof 2019.
To some, the apparent surge in arson incidents has been a troubling new development in California’s ever-worsening wildfire regime, and it has even given rise to a raft of conspiracy theories. Yet experts say the attention-grabbing headlines and uptick in arrests belie an enduring truth: Arson represents only a fraction of California’s fire starts each year.
What has changed, they say, is that bone-dry drought conditions and overgrown forests have enabled even the smallest of sparks toexplode into an inferno.
“Once they put that fire on the ground, they have no control over how it will grow,” said Gianni Muschetto, chief of Cal Fire’s law enforcement division.
California
After David Scott Smith and his son, Travis Shane Smith, were arrested a day earlier, prosecutors filed several felony charges against them Thursday.
In California, lawmakers distinguish between two types of arson: willful, malicious arson and reckless arson, such as when a person sets off fireworks in dry brush, Muschetto said. Identifying the source of a wildfire is one of the more technical jobs in law enforcement, and in 2019 — the most recent year for which he had data — the causes of the majority of California’s wildfires were undetermined. Electrical equipment accounted for about 12% and lightning  6%.
But arson was also a factor, sparking about 9% of fires in 2019, and roughly 8% to 10% of the state’s wildfires in any given year. In 2021, when Cal Fire responded to more than 8,600 fires, that could mean as many as 800 blazes.
One of the alleged arsonists who made national headlines this year was Gary Maynard, a former college professor linked to an“arson-setting spree”near the site of the Dixie fire, thesecond-largest wildfirein California’s recorded history.
Maynard was charged with willfully starting four fires in the Shasta-Trinity and Lassen national forests in July and August. Some of the blazes were set behind fire lines and in evacuation zones, with investigators in one instance identifying sticks, newspaper material and a wooden match in a burned area on the ground.
He has pleaded not guilty to all charges, his attorney said via email.
Witnesses at the scene said Maynard appeared to be mentally unstable. Officials confirmed that he had previously worked at two California universities, where he taught seminars in criminology and criminal justice.
California
Gary Stephen Maynard, 47, has been charged with willfully starting the Ranch fire and has been linked to at least six other blazes.
The circumstances around Maynard and other arson suspects prompted a wave of speculation among far-right groups and conspiracy theorists, with some falsely suggesting thatmembers of Antifawere intentionally setting fires as part of an elaborate political plot.
But the motives for arson are more complex than that, said Glenn Corbett, an associate professor of fire science and public administration at the John Jay College of Criminal Justice.
“There’s dozens of reasons why people start fires,” Corbett said, listing examples such as malice, recklessness, revenge, mental health issues or even just “bad behavior.”
The latest string of high-profile cases “to some extent trend with social upheaval,” Corbett said, including the COVID-19 pandemic and growing political and economic divides. “Sometimes those end up being ‘trigger events’ that sort of release people to do things that they probably wouldn’t normally do.”
But arson-related fires are especially dangerous given the record-setting heat and drought across the West, which have dried the landscape and primed it to burn — leading tofaster, hotter and more intense wildfiresthan ever before.
“The volume, the size, the ferocity of fire is tied directly to what’s burning,” Corbett said. “High levels of dryness and low levels of humidity and no rain ... that’s a prime situation for having a fire, and certainly one that is very difficult to contain.”
California
The dryness of the vegetation, primed by both long-term drought and shorter-term heat waves, is making it easy for fires to ignite and even easier for them to spread.
One blaze that quickly grew out of control was theFawn fire in Shasta County,which was allegedly ignited by a 31-year-old Caltech alumna named Alexandra Souverneva, who authorities say was found with CO2 cartridges and a lighter near where the fire ignited.
The fire grew quickly amid dry timber and heavy winds. By the end of its 10-day run, it had injured three firefighters, destroyed 185 buildings and charred more than 8,500 acres.
In December, Souverneva was ordered to a state mental hospital after a judge found hermentally unfit to stand trial.Her attorney did not respond to a request for comment.
But legal experts say her case and others like it raise important questions about how the state responds to instances of arson, which often involve external factors such as homelessness, mental health and drug use.
“The issue is not whether the punishment fits the crime — it’s that the punishment of incarceration doesn’t necessarily get to the root of the problem,” said Louis Shapiro, a defense attorney and former public defender in Los Angeles.
“Most arsonists have mental health issues which, if were timely treated, would avoid the arson fires from starting altogether,” he said. The “government needs to get ahead of these issues and proactively help those with mental health issues, rather than react to the damage after the fact. That is where the focus needs to be.”
Joel Dvoskin, a forensic psychologist who has studied arson, said it’s important to distinguish between people with mental disabilities and people experiencing emotional crises.
“When people do arson that’s only intended to cause destruction, that’s a despairing thing to do, and we live in a time when a lot of people are experiencing fear, anger and despair,” he said. “Those are the three emotions that cause so much damage in our world, and I doubt that arson is an exception.”
Like Shapiro, he said incarceration isn’t always the answer, particularly since the reasons for committing arson are so varied and complex.
In California, the penalties for arson can include fines or several years of imprisonment. Shapiro said the outcomes of cases resulting from negligence — such as a 2020 wildfire ignited by apyrotechnic device at a gender-reveal party— are harder to predict and largely depend on the way the sentencing judge views the case.
That fire, dubbed the El Dorado fire, went on to burn more than 22,000 acres andkill a firefighter.
California
Alexandra Souverneva has been charged with felony arson and committing arson during a state of emergency.
It’s an example of the kind of blaze that might have sputtered in a wetter climate but instead fed on hot, dry conditions that turned it into a monster, said Ed Nordskog, an arson investigator and co-author of “Arson Investigation in the Wildland.”
“The fuel is so dry because of the climate, and of course if there’s any sort of wind, that fire’s gone off to the races,” he said.
Still, what seems like a trend of arson in California may not actually reflect an increase in the number of people setting fires. California has more arson investigators than any other state and is becoming more proficient at catching offenders, Nordskog noted. States such as Colorado that may seem to have fewer instances of arson don’t have as many investigators contributing to their statistics, he said.
Dmitry Gorin, a defense attorney and former prosecutor, similarly emphasized that the numbers remain small.
“You’re seeing a lot of [cases] in the news now, and they usually happen during the fire season when it’s dry with high winds, so we hear about them,” Gorin said, “but as a matter of percentage of criminal cases in court, they’re pretty rare, even in California.”
Some arsonists are easier to catch than others, such as the woman who admitted to starting a fire near South Lake Tahoe in August after sheemerged from the scenein a bikini and “covered in scratches and soot.” Other cases are more complicated, including the large number of fires that are started by people living in the wildland-urban interface or people struggling with mental health issues and drug use, Nordskog said.
But in nearly all instances, the danger has gotten worse, he said. “Every fire has the potential to be a giant megafire.”
California
New study says climate change is essentially two-thirds to 88% responsible for the conditions driving wildfire woes in the western United States.
Earlier this month, prosecutors filed reckless-arson and firearm chargesagainst David and Travis Smith,a father and son suspected of starting theCaldor firenear South Lake Tahoe. That blaze, along with the Dixie fire, became the first to ever burnfrom one side of the Sierra to the other,and leveled the Gold Rush-era mountain town ofGrizzly Flats.
The Smiths’ attorney, Mark Reichel, said via email that they are “100% innocent” and even called for help as soon as they spotted the fire. They intend to beat all charges, he said.
But the outcome of the case won’t do much to budge statistics. Of the 140 arson arrests this year, only 29 were in the “reckless” category while 111 were willful, said Muschetto of Cal Fire. The agency issued about 360 citations for fire and fireworks violations this year.
Still, the confluence of cases and conditions is undeniably creating more challenges for the state’s residents and for those trying to protect them from the worst effects of wildfire.
“Whether it’s an accidental act or lightning or arson, that risk of those fires getting larger quicker is increasing with climate change,” Muschetto said.

"Newsom declares storm-related state of emergency in 20 counties, including L.A.",https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2021-12-30/california-storm-related-state-of-emergency,2021-12-31,"Gov. Gavin Newsom declared a state of emergency in 20 California counties on Thursday as winter storms continued to lash the state with record snow and rainfall that have knocked out power, shut down major roads and freeways, and caused debris flows, among other hazards.
According to the proclamation, the following counties are under a state of emergency: Alameda, Amador, Calaveras, El Dorado, Humboldt, Lake, Los Angeles, Marin, Monterey, Napa, Nevada, Orange, Placer, Sacramento, San Bernardino, San Luis Obispo, San Mateo, Santa Cruz, Sierra and Yuba.
The emergency proclamation will support response and recovery efforts after the storms, including by expanding access to state resources under the state’s Disaster Assistance Act, according to a statement by Newsom’s office.
California
With more than 5 inches of rain in December and counting, Los Angeles played host to another winter storm that promises to bring even more moisture to the area through New Year’s Eve.
It directs the California Department of Transportation to request immediate help through the Federal Highway Administration’s Emergency Relief Program for highway repairs or reconstruction and eases access to unemployment benefits for residents who lose their jobs because of the storms.
In Los Angeles, the slow-moving storm caused multiple road and highway closures and triggered evacuations near wildfire burn scars.

Firefighters rescued at least 50 people from the Leo Carrillo State Park campground in Malibu after rainfall sent a torrent of muddy water through the area, and accumulating ice and snow forced officials to close a portion of the Grapevine in both directions of the 5 Freeway for several hours.
Travelers at downtown L.A.’s Union Station were sent scrambling in the morning as several inches of water filled at least one hallway.
In the Sierra Nevada, record-breaking snowfall brought communities to a standstill as storms cut power to tens of thousands of residents and officials urged residents and visitors to stay off mountain roads until conditions improve.

Colorado wildfires burn hundreds of homes and force evacuations,https://www.latimes.com/world-nation/story/2021-12-30/colorado-cities-evacuated-by-wind-driven-wildfire,2021-12-31,"DENVER —An estimated 580 homes, a hotel and a shopping center have burned and tens of thousands of people were evacuated in wind-fueled wildfires outside Denver, officials said Thursday evening.
Boulder County Sheriff Joe Pelle said one injury has been reported and he didn’t rule out the possibility of more injuries or deaths to come given the intensity of fires that quickly swept across the region as winds gusted up to 105 mph.
The first fire erupted just before 10:30 a.m. and was “attacked pretty quickly and laid down later in the day and is currently being monitored,” with no structures lost, Pelle said.
A second wildfire, reported just after 11 a.m., “ballooned and spread rapidly east,” Pelle said. The blaze spans 2.5 square miles and has engulfed parts of the area in smoky, orangish skies and sent residents scrambling to get to safety.
Thursday night’s wind activity will determine when crews are able to go in and begin assessing the damage and searching for any victims.
“This is the kind of fire we can’t fight head on,” Pelle said. “We actually had deputy sheriffs and firefighters in areas that had to pull out because they just got overrun.”
The city of Louisville, which has a population of about 21,000, was ordered to evacuate after all 13,000 residents in Superior were told to leave. The neighboring towns are roughly 20 miles northwest of Denver.
Several blazes started in the area Thursday, at least some sparked by downed power lines.
Six people who were injured in the fires were being treated at UCHealth Broomfield Hospital, spokesperson Kelli Christensen said. A nearby portion of U.S. Highway 36 was shut down.
Colorado’s Front Range, where most of the state’s population lives, had an extremely dry and mild fall, and winter so far has continued to be mostly dry. Snow was expected Friday in the region, though.
Video captured by a bystander outside a Superior Costco store showed winds whipping through trees in the parking lot surrounded by gray skies, a hazy sun and small fires scattered across the ground.

As states agree to leave more water in the Colorado River reservoir, Native tribes get more involved after a history of being left on the water management sidelines.
Leah Angstman and her husband saw similar skies while returning to their Louisville home from Denver International Airport after being away for the holidays. As they were sitting on the bus going toward Boulder, Angstman recalled leaving clear blue skies and abruptly entering clouds of brown and yellow smoke.
“The wind rocked the bus so hard that I thought the bus would tip,” she wrote in a message to the Associated Press.
The visibility was so poor that the bus had to pull over, and they waited a half-hour until a regional transit authority van escorted them to a turnaround on the highway. There she saw four fires burning in bushes across the highway, she said.
“The sky was dark, dark brown, and the dirt was blowing in swirls across the sidewalk like snakes,” she said.

The best we can hope for is incremental progress — two steps forward, one step back, a string of little victories.
Angstman ended up evacuating, getting in a car with her husband and driving northeast without knowing where they would end up.
Vignesh Kasinath, an assistant professor of biochemistry at the University of Colorado in Boulder, evacuated from a neighborhood in Superior with his wife and her parents. Kasinath said the family was overwhelmed because of the sudden evacuation warning and anxious from the chaos while trying to leave.
“It’s only because I am active on Twitter I came to know about this,” said Kasinath, who said he did not receive an official evacuation notice from authorities.
The fires prompted Gov. Jared Polis to declare a state of a emergency, allowing the state to access disaster emergency funds.
The evacuations come as climate change ismaking weather more extremeand wildfires more frequent and destructive, scientists say.A historic drought and heat waveshave made wildfires harder to fight in the U.S. West.

Standing room only: Balboa Island Ferry to be closed to vehicles for most of January,https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2021-12-29/newport-beach-balboa-island-ferry-temporary-closure-to-vehicles,2021-12-30,"Motorists hoping to visit or leave Newport Beach’s Balboa Island will have to take the long way around next month as the Balboa Island Ferry will temporarily close to vehicles.
Beginning Jan. 3, the century-old ferry, which carries vehicles and passengers through Newport Bay from the Balboa Peninsula to the island and back, will be open to foot and bike traffic only as the city begins electrical work on the island’s Agate Avenue, where the ferry terminal is located.
The work is part of a $6.2-million utility “undergrounding” project, which will bury overhead power and other utility lines, Newport Beach assistant city engineer Mike Sinacori told the Orange County Register.
Construction is slated to end Jan. 28, according to the ferry’s social media page.
The temporary suspension of vehicle service will add around six miles to the journeys of motorists hoping to take their cars between the island and the peninsula.
The ferry shortens that trip to less than 1,000 feet.
One-way fares for the minutes-long ride are $1.25 for adults and 50 cents for children 5 to 11. For bicyclists, the fares rise to $1.50 for adults and 75 cents for children.

San Diego County plane crash victims identified as two nurses and two pilots,https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2021-12-29/nurses-pilots-identified-victims-learjet-crash-gillespie-field-el-cajon,2021-12-30,"SAN DIEGO —Thefour people killedwhen a medical transport jet crashed in an unincorporated area near the suburb of El Cajon this week were identified Wednesday by authorities, friends and professional organizations.
The San Diego County medical examiner’s office identified two of the victims as Douglas James Grande, 42, and Julian Jorge Bugaj, 67. Both men were licensed pilots. Friends and colleagues said nurses Tina Ward and Laurie Gentz were the passengers.
For the record:
4:21 p.m. Dec. 30, 2021A previous version of this story said pilot Douglas James Grande was 45 years old. He was 42.
The four were on a Learjet 35 thatcrashed and exploded on a residential streetin the Bostonia neighborhood about 1.5 miles from Gillespie Field, killing everyone on board.
Under cold and dark skies Wednesday, several people — presumably friends and family — were allowed behind the yellow tape that surrounded the crash site. They left without talking to reporters. Moments later, authorities pulled down the tape and opened the scene.
Left behind was a makeshift memorial of bright flowers and messages. Among them was a family photo — Grande with a woman and two girls — with messages scrawled on the white frame. “I love you so much dad. I miss you,” one read. “You are my everything,” read another.
Grande’s LinkedIn page states that he was a captain with Aeromedevac Air Ambulance and had been with the medical transport company since May 2019, also working as a first officer.
Aeromedevac posted onits Facebook pageWednesday images of two black ribbons and the words “With a heavy heart we mourn the lives of our friends and our family.” It later added a post confirming “the devastating loss of our colleagues.”
“The loss of our friends has left us an indescribable void. To both us and their families they are unsung heroes, dedicating their lives caring for others in need throughout our community,” the statement said, in part.
A message left with the company seeking comment was not immediately returned.
California
Two crew members and two passengers were killed in the El Cajon crash Monday evening.
Ward, one of the flight nurses, was the wife of recently retired Oceanside Deputy Fire Chief Joe Ward, according to anInstagram postTuesday from the union that represents Oceanside Fire Department members.
Acting Oceanside Fire Chief David Parsons sent a message to other fire chiefs in the region confirming the death and saying that the “greater Oceanside Fire Department family has experienced a terrible loss.”
“Tina was well known within the department and words can’t convey the hurt and loss the family and many of us feel,” Parsons wrote. He said the Ward family was surrounded by support and had asked for privacy.
Ward’s Facebook page said she had joined Aeromedevac Air Ambulance as a flight nurse in August and had worked as an emergency room nurse at Palomar Pomerado Health in northern San Diego County. Her page also includes several pictures of her with her husband and three daughters, the most recent posted a day before the deadly crash.
Gentz was identified in a Facebook post by theInternational Assn. of EMTs and Paramedics, which said Gentz was the president of a local chapter.
“President Gentz will be greatly missed by all who knew her and all who benefit from her selfless contributions to organized labor in the Greater San Diego area,” the post reads.
On her Facebook page, Gentz had noted that she started with Aeromedevac in February and previously had worked with another air ambulance company.
Gentz also worked with American Medical Response, which provides medical transport services such as ambulances. The company declined to offer a full statement out of respect for Aeromedevac but said it was “grieving along with their team, and we offer our deepest condolences to the organization and the families, friends and colleagues of those involved.”
The plane had taken off from Orange County’s John Wayne Airport less than 20 minutes before crashing about 7:15 p.m. Monday.
The Federal Aviation Administration and the National Transportation Safety Board are investigating the incident and have not said what led to the crash.
On Tuesday, the NTSB said the plane had been on an instrument approach to Runway 17 at Gillespie Field. “As the airplane neared the airport environment, the pilot requested a change to a visual approach to Runway 27R,” an agency spokesperson said.
It was unclear why the runway change was made, but one aviation expert said the pilot may have wanted to use a longer runway because of rain and mist in the region that night.
Max Trescott, a flight instructor who specializes in aviation safety, said it appeared the pilottried to perform a difficult landing maneuverat an unusually low altitude shortly before the crash.
In the hours before Monday night’s fatal crash, the jet had flown to Arizona and Orange County before returning to El Cajon.
According to the Flight Aware website, the plane left Gillespie Field just before 2 p.m., landing at Lake Havasu City’s airport less than 25 minutes later.
The plane took off about 90 minutes after that and arrived at John Wayne Airport just after 4:45 p.m.
The plane left John Wayne at 6:56 p.m. and crashed shortly before 7:15 p.m. while on approach to Gillespie.

Officials declare O.C. oil spill cleanup complete,https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2021-12-29/officials-declare-o-c-oil-spill-cleanup-complete,2021-12-29,"Nearly three months after anundersea pipeline spilledthousands of gallons of crude oil into the waters off Southern California, authorities have announced that coastal cleanup efforts are now complete.
“After sustained cleanup operations for the Southern California oil spill, affected shoreline segments have been returned to their original condition,” officials said in a news release Tuesday. The unified command cleanup response was led by the U.S. Coast Guard, the California Department of Fish and Wildlife’s office of oil spill prevention and response, and Orange and San Diego counties.
Authorities werefirst alertedto the possibility of an oil spill off  Orange County on Friday, Oct.  1. Residents noticed a sheen that Saturday, and by sunrise the following morning, a diesel-like odor had overtaken the area as an oil slick neared Huntington Beach. Crashing waves brought dark crude onto the shore, along with dead birds and fish.
Response teams mobilized quickly, including biologists and environmentalists who scrambled to put barriers between the oil and Talbert Marsh, a 25-acre ecological reserve that is home to dozens of species. Gov. Gavin Newsomdeclared a state of emergencyin Orange County.
“In a year that has been filled with incredibly challenging issues, this oil spill constitutes one of the most devastating situations that our community has dealt with in decades,” Huntington Beach Mayor Kim Carr said at the time.
California
An oil slick believed to have originated from a pipeline leak has hit Huntington Beach, closing a stretch of beach and raising grave wildlife and environmental concerns.
The spill sparked a statewide conversation aboutfossil fuel relianceand also renewed calls for the government to take more aggressive action against theaging oil platformsthat dot the state’s coast.
Orange County Supervisor Katrina Foley, whose district includes Huntington Beach, said Wednesday it was “great to have the cleanup component of this behind us,” but that there is still much work to be done.
“The first thing that we’ve learned is that this aging infrastructure is decomposing and is not being well-maintained, and that has to be addressed immediately,” Foley said. “The second most important lesson is that there is a galvanization of community support todecommission these rigs, so long as we are able to transfer those ‘dirty energy’ jobs to ‘clean energy’ jobs and take care of the workers.”
Foley  said the spill’s effects rippled through the coastal community — from local fisheries and surf schools that lost business, to damaged properties and canceled events, including thePacific Airshowthat had been scheduled  that weekend.
“There was, I think, a dramatic understanding by those who might not have been so aligned with the environmentalists as to the impacts of offshore oil drilling,” she said. “It’s impactful to the economy, impactful to the environment, to the coast — to our lives in general. I think all those factors combining together really hit people hard this time, more so than in the past.”
Business
Even beyond climate change, there are many reasons to transition to solar and wind power — the Huntington Beach oil spill among them.
The 25,000-gallon spill was quickly linked to an oil processing platform called Elly, which stands roughly nine miles from shore, in federal waters.
In the days and weeks that followed, Elly’s operator, Amplify Energy Corp., fell under increasing scrutiny for a15-hour delayin notifying federal regulators about the spill.
Coast guard investigators say adragging anchormay have damaged the 17-mile pipeline that runs from Elly to a terminal in Long Beach, although the exact cause of the spill remains unclear.
Earlier this month, a federal grand juryindicted Amplify Energyand two subsidiaries on criminal charges for their alleged role in the spill.
Amplify has also participated in the cleanup effort.
“This response was a true team effort — one that included the commitment and dedication of federal, state and local agencies along with our response team,” read a statement from Dan Steward, vice president of Amplify Energy’s Beta operations. “We are grateful for their work and would like to thank all the members of the Unified Command for their professionalism and collaboration over the past three months.”
The pipeline remains shut down, officials said. Representatives from the Pipeline Hazardous Material Safety Administration, the Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement and the state fire marshal are overseeing flushing operations to remove the remaining oil from the line.
Meanwhile,multiple lawsuitsand civil claims are making their way through the court system. Foley said the county’s claims for cleanup efforts alone amount to more than $1 million.
California
A federal grand jury accused Amplify Energy Corp. and two subsidiary firms of illegally discharging oil from a pipeline they operated off Huntington Beach.
The oil also impacted wildlife. In the wake of the spill, veterinary officials at the UC Davis Oiled Wildlife Care Network reported 82 dead birds,  three dead sea lions and a dead bottlenose dolphin,among other impacted animals.
Debbie McGuire, executive director of the Wetlands and Wildlife Care Center in Huntington Beach, was among the network members to respond.
“I was pretty stressed out. I was pretty scared,” she said Wednesday, noting that the group is still watching for potential victims even though the cleanup has been declared complete.
While birds tend to get sick right away — the oil ruins their waterproofing and leaves them susceptible to cold and hypothermia — marine mammals can have chronic problems that show up later, she said.
And though the spill ended up being smaller than officials feared — it was initially estimated to be 126,000 gallons — McGuire said it was a distressing reminder of the precariousness of oil production in California. The group also responded to theRefugio oil spillin Santa Barbara in 2015 and theAmerican Trader oil spillin 1990.
“Jump forward 31 years, and we have another oil spill,” she said, adding: “Everyone should probably take a good look and think about how safe it is to have those drilling platforms.”
Yetanother oil sheenwas spotted in the area in November and was quickly contained.
California
The oil spill had reached the Talbert Marsh and some environmentally sensitive wetlands areas by Sunday morning.
Foley said one positive takeaway from the spill was that it became a “great model for how public agencies at the federal, state and local level can partner together, including partnering with local business and residents.”
She also said it drove home the  effects of offshore oil drilling, both economic and environmental.
It’s time to “get moving on that [transition] process in a way that’s thoughtful, but is planning for a future for California that does not include oil rigs off the coast,” she said.
Christian Corbo, the patrol lieutenant with the California Department of Fish and Wildlife who served as the state’s on-scene coordinator, expressed gratitude to the hundreds of responders who “rushed in with their experience and expertise early on and remained committed over the course of the response.”
“We are grateful to all the dedicated scientists, wildlife care experts, technical specialists and law enforcement personnel who commit themselves to protecting our natural resources,” Corbo said in a statement.
The Department of Fish and Wildlife in November determined it was safe to eat seafood taken from the waters, andfishing operationsoff  Orange County  have resumed.
U.S. Coast Guard Captain Rebecca Ore, the incident’s federal on-scene coordinator, echoed Corbo’s sentiment.
“The collaborative efforts of the first responders, public safety professionals, assessment teams and response workers were critical to ensure our waters, beaches and wildlife were cleaned to the highest standard,” she said, noting that the response included more than 1,800 personnel.
Officials said the oiled sand and debris are being disposed of in a special landfill designed for petroleum-contaminated material.
The spill response will now enter a “transition period” in which the unified command will monitor for incidents of tar balls and oil, and analyze  any findings to determine their source.
Members of the public are asked to report any sizable sightings of oil or oily debris to the National Response Center at 1-800-424-8802.
Once the unified command team determines that the transition period is over, the oil spill response will officially conclude.

There’s a battle brewing over changes to California solar incentives. Newsom is in the middle,https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2022-01-31/skelton-rooftop-solar-incentives-changes,2022-01-31,"SACRAMENTO —Rooftop solar is generating intense heat on Gov. Gavin Newsom. And he’s quietly trying to cool it down.
He’s doing that by pressuring warring interest groups and the California Public Utilities Commission.
Governors and interests regularly pressure one another. It’s part of the political playbook.
But the PUC is officially an independent agency. And governors aren’t supposed to lean on the commissioners in their policymaking. Wink, wink.
Successful governors do, of course. They’d be negligent not to. They appoint all five members and name the president. Governors often get credit or blame for their appointees’ decisions.
Newsom recently appointed two new commissioners. One was his energy advisor, Alice Reynolds, whom he installed as president.
“I’ve never known a governor who didn’t have a tremendous influence on the PUC,” says Susan Kennedy, a former commissioner.
“I know every major decision I ever made, I was in constant communication with the governor’s office.”
Kennedy speaks from unusual experience. She was a top advisor to two governors of both parties, serving as Democrat Gray Davis’ Cabinet secretary and Republican Arnold Schwarzenegger’s chief of staff. Davis placed her on the commission, and Schwarzenegger named her his top aide after they developed a close working relationship at the PUC.
The hot issue now at the PUC is its proposal todrastically reduce subsidies for homeowners who spent thousands of dollars to install rooftop solarafter being promised a generous price for the electricity they generated but didn’t use. That plus the fact they’d need to buy fewer kilowatts from an electricity utility made it a sweet long-term investment for those who could afford the installation.
Climate & Environment
Want to go solar, or already have rooftop panels? Here’s how proposed changes would affect you.
Governors — particularly Schwarzenegger — used thesefinancial incentivesto coax homeowners into creating their own solar electricity so they’d burn less fossil-fuel-generated energy that warmed the planet.
The strategy has been highly successful. There aremore than 1.3 million rooftop solar installations in California, and this state leads the nation in clean energy.
But utilities say the incentives have become way too generous, and the PUC agrees. Utilities are forced to pay rooftop solar owners several times more for their unused electricity than it’s worth. The kilowatts can be bought a lot cheaper from big solar farms.
Moreover, people who own rooftop solar tend to be comfortable financially. Those who don’t generally have much lower incomes and are stuck paying for wealthy people’s subsidies through higher electricity rates.
The private utilities — Southern California Edison, Pacific Gas & Electric and San Diego Gas & Electric — are allowed by the PUC to earn a certain profit. If solar owners aren’t kicking in their fair share of the profit, non-solar customers get hit up. And that’s what’s happening, according to the PUC.
“Utilities don’t end up paying for the over-subsidies. Other customers do. And those people are poorer,” says Severin Borenstein, faculty director of the UC Energy Institute. “It’s adding to the rise in electricity prices.”
OK, but rooftop solar owners are angry. They accuse the state of reneging on a promise made years ago of a nifty deal for partially switching to green energy.
“This is a bait and switch,” says Jamie Court, a strategist for activist Consumer Watchdog.
Schwarzenegger, in an op-ed piece for the New York Times, declared that the PUC plan “should be stopped in its tracks.”
Business
Clean energy activists and utility giants are duking it out over the future of rooftop solar.
U.S. Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) also has weighed in, writing the new PUC president that the plan “is concerning and may impact the state’s conservation goals as we address climate change.”
Especially grating for solar owners is a PUC plan to impose a monthly fee of around $50 for generating the green energy. The fee would help pay the utilities’ fixed costs, such as grid maintenance and wildfire mitigation. Ordinarily, a customer would pay that money when buying a utility’s electricity. But that’s being avoided by using home-generated solar energy.
The PUC calls it a “grid participation charge.”
“Let’s call it what it is: a solar tax,” Schwarzenegger writes.
“Everyone agrees [the subsidies] need to be reformed,” says Kennedy, who adds she isn’t involved in the fight. “How do you keep the solar industry going but not put in something politically stupid like a tax?”
California’s rooftop solar program leads the nation, but now has to evolve.
Both sides are running TV ads trying to rile the public into shouting at the governor and the PUC.
“We’re trying to make him feel the heat and to understand that if he wants to be a climate change leader, he’s going to have to lead and not be put in a position where California has the worst rooftop solar policy in America,” Court says. “He’s got everybody on his butt.”
Newsom has urged both sides to get off their own butts and compromise. They’ve been lectured in his office by top aides.
One side includes the PUC, utilities, labor unions that install solar farm panels, and reformers. On the other side are rooftop solar owners and the companies that sell and install the panels, plus green energy advocates.
The PUC had scheduled a final decision for last week but delayed it — a sign the panel is trying to cut a deal.
Newsom is in a bind. He believes the subsidies are too generous and poor people are getting rooked. But he’s worried about being tagged as anti-solar.
The governor has said very little publicly.
“There’s a lot of work to do. Leave it at that,” he told reporters three weeks ago. “Many conversations. Lots of balls in the air.”
Surely Newsom can covertly maneuver the PUC toward a compromise that’s fair to solar owners, low-income ratepayers and the utilities, while expanding clean energy. And lower the temperature on himself.

Destructive fire in Colorado last month might have begun underground,https://www.latimes.com/world-nation/story/2022-01-31/deadly-colorado-blaze-renews-focus-underground-coal-fires,2022-01-31,"DENVER —A fire raging in an underground Colorado coal field in 1883 sent so much smoke pouring from cracks in the ground that the scene was likened to burning volcanoes and the state’s first mining inspector deemed the blaze “impossible to extinguish.”
Nearly 140 years later, two fires still smolder in the now-abandoned coal field near Boulder — the same area where a wildfire last monthdestroyed more than 1,000 homes and buildingsand killed at least one person.
It’s still unknown what caused the December blaze, which became the most destructive in Colorado history, but Boulder County authorities have said they’re investigating the area’s abandoned coal mines asone of several possible causes, along with power lines, human activity and other possibilities.
Could smoldering coal have started such a fire? History shows the answer is yes, with at least two Colorado blazes in the past 20 years blamed on mine fires that spread to the surface. And in Montana last summer, slow-burning coal reserves fanned by winds sparked a pair of blazes that burned 267 square miles on and around the Northern Cheyenne Indian Reservation.
Across the U.S., at least 259 underground mine fires burned in more than a dozen states as of last September, according to data from the federal Office of Surface Mining. There are hundreds, possibly thousands, more undocumented blazes in coal seams that have never been mined, researchers and government officials say.
Globally, such fires are also a problem, including in India, Australia and South Africa. In China, the world’s largest coal producer, an estimated 10 million to 200 million tons of the fuel annually burn or are left inaccessible by fires, according to the U.S. Geological Survey.
World & Nation
The flames ripped through at least 9.4 square miles and left nearly 1,000 homes and other buildings destroyed in suburbs between Denver and Boulder.
As climate change leads to drought across larges swaths of the western U.S. that arealready seeing longer and more destructive fire seasons, experts say smoldering coal fires will pose a continuing threat.
Such fires can be ignited by lightning, humans and even spontaneously at temperatures as low as 86 degrees, said Jurgen Brune a Colorado School of Mines engineering professor. Many are impossible to put out, slowly burning underground as the combustion feeds off a small amount of oxygen present in the coal, he said.
“Covering it up and trying to take away the oxygen from the fire puts out most fires. Not for coal fires,” Brune said.
Underground coal seams burn unpredictably, and fires can break through to the surface without warning long after they start, he said.
A winter conflagration that quickly tore through suburban neighborhoods near Boulder, Colo., last week should shatter illusions about safety across the Western U.S. as the warming climate primes conditions for disastrous fires.
“It’s like trying to predict an earthquake,” Brune said. “With all the technology we have today they are not coming any closer to predicting them. The same goes for a coal fire.”
The fires emit toxic mercury and the greenhouse gas carbon dioxide, and cause sinkholes when the ground’s surface collapses into burned cavities below. In Centralia, Pa., the fumes and subsidence from a coal fire thatstarted beneath the town in 1962got so bad that more than 1,000 people eventually relocated at a cost of $42 million.
The estimated future cost to control the 200 known abandoned mine blazes across the U.S. is almost $900 million, according to the Office of Surface Mining database.
In the wake of last summer’s fires, local officials in Montana plan to map out burning seams across the state’s southeast in coming months using a federal grant. Controlling them will be difficult and could cost a minimum of $300,000 per site, said Bobbi Vannattan with the Rosebud Conservation District, which is helping to coordinate the mapping.

“The problem with coal seam fires is we don’t know how deep they are or how wide they are until you get in there and start digging,” she said.
In Colorado, officials were monitoring at least 38 underground coal fires as of 2019.
Boulder County Sheriff’s Office spokesperson Carrie Haverfield declined to specify which mines were being investigatedin relation to the Dec. 30 blazeor what prompted authorities’ interest, which was first reported by KUSA-TV.
At least three efforts were made by authorities to quench or reduce damage from a blaze that the state mine inspector first encountered more than a century ago at the abandoned Marshall Mine, located on parkland in the vicinity of where investigators believe the recent fire started.
California
A confounding collection of Californians have been accused of arson this year. Experts weigh in on the causes and consequences of the complex crime.
The first of those efforts came in 1982, when federal officials drilled into the ground to investigate how far the fire extended and later sought to smother it with a two-foot layer of dirt, according to a U.S. Geological Survey report.
In 2005, a small brush fire was traced back to a hot vent from the fire. Crews from Boulder removed vegetation in the area and federal officials tried to fill the vent and others with rocks to try to protect against another fire, according to the Office of Surface Mining. In 2016, after federal officials said the state had taken control of the site, workers excavated and filled in two areas where the ground had subsided after fire consumed the underground coal.
When the site was visited two years later by workers for a state contractor, Tetra Tech, they found no evidence of fire — no melting snow, no smoky odors. The company recommended annual monitoring of the site because of its past erratic behavior but no new steps to abate the potential hazard.
“The fire’s activity is very low and thus presents little potential to start a surface fire,” Tetra Tech wrote in a 2019 report prepared for the Colorado Division of Reclamation, Mining and Safety.
California
The Colorado fire, which started Friday night in Big Sur, was sparked by embers from a pile burn meant to clear combustible fuels.
Generally, the responsibility of monitoring coal mine fires falls to the property owner, according to the division. The Marshall Mine fire sits under an open-space park owned by the city of Boulder, near a state highway.
Boulder officials said they don’t have responsibility to do work on the fire. However, the city is required to notify the state if rangers or trail crews at the popular hiking area see smoke or shifts, city spokesperson Sarah Huntley said.
The state mining division said it was not notified of any changes at the mine fire since the 2019 report.
The state receives federal funding to help property owners monitor or mitigate abandoned coal mine fires. But the mining division cannot require any work be done at the sites, spokesperson Chris Arend said.

What can Houston teach Los Angeles about solving homelessness?,https://www.latimes.com/opinion/story/2022-01-30/houston-teach-los-angeles-curbing-homelessness,2022-01-30,"The struggle to solve homelessness is getting harder nearly everywhere. Yet recent years have still seen many more victories than defeats. And the biggest victory is in greater Houston, which over the last decade has cut homelessnessby more than half.
Houston’s story holds lessons for Los Angeles. The chief one is that solving homelessness is less about economics than about strategic clarity and execution.
Evidence that homelessness isnotan inescapable fact of modern post-industrial life is not hard to find. From the time systematic counting began in 2007 to the last official count in 2020, the homeless population fell nationwide by 10.3%.
The decline has been especially significant among homeless families with children, which is particularly good news.
If that good news seems too removed from the particular woes of West Coast mega-cities, note that while homelessness in Los Angeles County was doubling over the last decade, it was significantly dropping in Long Beach — in the same crazed Southern California housing market and same unequal local economy. It’s also fallen inPasadenaandGlendale, the two other cities that handle homelessness separately from the rest of the county.
L.A. and Houston are the second- and fourth-largest cities in the country, two vast, highly diverse Sun Belt sprawls. Houston has slightly higher poverty levels, while L.A.’s unemployment rate fell close to Houston’s leading into the pandemic.
One significant difference: Rents in Los Angeles are much higher than in Houston. This gave L.A. a much bigger homelessness problem even when it was half its current scale.
In many ways, Houston has the harder battle.
Among 15 metropolitan areas tracked by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, Greater Los Angeles had thehighest wage growth in the nationin the 12 months that ended in September. Houston ranked near the bottom.
Houston hasfewer affordable housing unitsper extremely low-income families than any U.S. city but Las Vegas. Los Angeles is only slightly better.
Over much of the past decade, Houston’sHarris County had the highest eviction ratein the nation after New York City.
Yet Houston continues to hold its ground against homelessness. Here’s how the city has done it:
Scale of effort.Houston provides many times more affordable permanent housing units — much of it including supportive health and social services — than its headcount of the homeless population on any given night, according to Houston’s Coalition for the Homeless. Permanent housing has been its whole focus. Temporary shelter is left entirely to churches and other nonprofits.
To approach Houston’s effort — and offer enough permanent housing to cut its nightly homeless population by half — L.A. would have to multiply its efforts by more than fivefold to provide at least 150,000 total units, according to my analysis of recent housing data.
Excellent organization. Greater Houston’s single lead homeless agencyorchestrates its services supremely well. Its efforts include integrating front-line health and housing services workers, training them to understand each other’s jargon and pioneering a shared database for tracking all official interactions with people experiencing homelessness, their needs and their use of services.
Pragmatism. Houston appears not to have let compassion for the homeless warp into a respect for homelessness itself. The focus has been on making homelessness“rare, brief and nonrecurring,”and not necessarily a more comfortable option. Houston hasdecommissioned eight homeless encampmentsin the last year, offering residents a path into permanent housing. Between85% and 90% of homeless peopletake up that offer. Those who don’t still have to move on from the encampments.
Houston’s approach can be summed up asstrategic clarity.
Those who work on solving homelessness in Los Angeles understand this. Thearchitect of the Houston systemwas even brought in toconsult on organizing the L.A. system.
But what makes this so hard for Los Angeles?
Strangely, it’s not the cost of real estate that gets in the way of building more housing. Studies put land costs at only about one-eighth of the total cost of building supportive, affordable housing in L.A.
It’s not the mashup of jurisdictions involved. Houston’s homelessness agency straddles three counties and many municipalities — not to mention the tensions of operating a city thatleans politically bluein a ragingly red state. Los Angeles looks almost seamless by comparison.
It’s not race that differentiates. Black people are highlyoverrepresented among the homelesseverywhere. Houston has a much higher Black population than Los Angeles but much lower homelessness.
Here’s what makes progress hard in Los Angeles:
No one’s in charge.Individual leaders buzz with impatience for action; saintlike individuals produce quiet acts of compassionate heroism — but the systems exude a muddy lack of urgency. No government or agency has the authority or mandate to assert leadership, set priorities and take decisive action in dealing with homelessness. Unlike Houston, Los Angeles has a weak-mayor system, no top-elected official in the county and no executive position with a comparable agenda-setting power. The many local bureaucracies involved are a confused tangle of mismatched authorities, responsibilities and resources.
Los Angeles doesn’t know what it wants.Housing growth has been deliberately slowed by 40 years of zoning restrictions, says Jason Ward, an economist at the Rand Corp. That can make sense in a place that ships its water in from a different climate zone, is strangled with traffic, surrounded by wildfire risk and sits astride a major earthquake fault. It also serves voters who want to protect their own property values. All these legitimate concerns — regulated with maddening inefficiency — serve as a roadblock to affordable housing. Even the labor protections baked intoProposition HHH’s $1.2 billionto fund homeless housing, according to a recent Rand study, may ultimately cost Los Angeles800 additional housing units.
L.A.’s compassion is conflicted.It vacillates between wanting to end homelessness and making homelessness more comfortable. In reviewing the academic literature on the economics of homelessness, Columbia University professor Brendan O’Flaherty concluded that many of the measures projected for Los Angeles under Proposition HHH “are designed not to reduce street homelessness, but to create a large but well-groomed and well-mannered street population: dedicated parking lots, storage facilities for possessions, portable toilets, and drop-in and hygiene centers.”
Every step that makes street homelessness a little less uncomfortable has the unintended consequence of drawing more people into the streets. The clearest evidence of this was the aftermath of a 2012 court ruling thatforbade the city of Los Angeles from seizing property onskidrowwithout a specific legal reason. Because the ruling applied only to the city, in the two years straddling the ruling unsheltered homelessness rose within city limits at 10 times the rate of the rest of L.A. County.
While the court ruling showed a reasonable respect for people with very little stuff and nowhere to put it, it also showed the huge elasticity of street homelessness.
Those trying to solve homelessness in Los Angeles are seen as capable and committed. Likewise, surveys show Angelenos are concerned about the impact of homelessness on neighborhood quality of life as well as the hardships homeless people endure. Holding those two legitimate concerns simultaneously is strikingly mature and healthy.
But strategic clarity and crisp execution have been painfully slow in coming. About athousand of the 10,000 affordable unitspromised by Proposition HHH, passed in 2016, have been opened — at astronomical costs.
The takeaway from Houston is that L.A.’s problem is, at its root, an organizational problem, and there’s opportunity in that. If Los Angeles could to a significant degree achieve clarity of purpose around homelessness, fully empower an agency to own it — and align the rest of the bureaucracies to work together — that approach could serve as a template for how L.A. can organize itself more effectively and inclusively as a high-functioning community.
Meanwhile, real progress in affordable housing will probably take place in tens of thousands of backyards and former garages as restrictions fall away for accessory dwelling units and single-family zoning ends.
Many people now living on the streets still won’t fit in that world. To house them, and to reclaim the public spaces they inhabit, Los Angeles will need to decide what it really wants for these struggling people, then organize itself to achieve it on a much greater scale.

"California to pay for wildfire retrofits up to $40,000 per home, starting in rural San Diego",https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2022-01-28/california-wildfire-retrofits-rural-san-diego,2022-01-28,"SAN DIEGO —Fearing wildfire, Jack Dillender has been doing everything within his budget to harden his three-bedroom house, which is nestled between the windswept, boulder-strewn hillsides of Dulzura. The rural hamlet, within 10 miles of the Mexico border, is among several nearby communities along state Route 94 routinely blasted by flames and dangerously intrusive embers.
The 42-year-old, who lives with his fiancée and her two children, said he’s been slowly installing double-paned windows, as well as relentlessly chopping back vegetation on the 47-acre property.
The process has proven tremendously expensive and time consuming. However, he said, he’s better off than many of his neighbors.
“A lot of the people are lower income; the houses are older and the properties are large,” said Dillender, who works as a technician   servicing fire alarms and sprinkler systems in office buildings.
Now, help could be on the way. California recently launched a novel $100-million pilot program in collaboration with the Federal Emergency Management Agency, or FEMA, to pay for home retrofits in high-fire areas.
San Diego County has been chosen by state officials to spearhead the new initiative — doling out up to $40,000 per home across 500 backcountry residences from Dulzura to Campo. Firefighting officials have only just started taking applications for the three-year endeavor, which aims to tackle everything from installing ember-resistant screens on home vents to replacing windows, siding and roofs.
County Fire Deputy Chief Dave Nissen, who has worked in the region’s bucolic eastern communities for 30 years, said he hopes that folks will take advantage of the free upgrades.
“We’re not here to push this down anybody’s throat, but at the same time, we think it’s a high-value program,” he said. “We just want to take the time to make sure people are making a well-informed decision, whether they want to be a part of this or not.”
The financial-assistance program, mandated underAssembly Bill 38in 2019, came in the wake of the devastating Camp fire, which laid waste to the town of Paradise a year earlier.
The blaze, which jumped from home to home, often leaving surrounding trees intact, showcased a disturbing trend long familiar to those living in Southern California. Suburban subdivisions and even entire towns that abut wildland areas can catch fire in ember storms that travel far ahead of a flame front.
In short, homes become the fuel — especially those structures built before California rolled out a series of fire-resistant building codes starting in the 1990s.
“Houses are accelerants, but if you do the work — defensible space, building codes — you can minimize the acceleration that a subdivision can generate when a wildfire comes screaming over the ridgeline,” said Char Miller, a professor of environmental analysis at Pomona College who has written extensively about wildfires.
Wildfire prevention in California has largely focused on using heavy equipment to thin densely packed,fire-starved forests, such as in the Sierra Nevada. Hundreds of millions of dollars are currently slated for such work under spending approved by Gov. Gavin Newsom as well as the$1-trillionfederal infrastructure bill.
However, in recent years, agrowing chorusof researchers and environmental advocates have pointed out that much of the state’s structure loss from uncontrolled conflagrations happens not in heavily forested areas, but in communities surrounded by brush and grasslands.
While chainsaws do little to tamp down the threat of wildfire in Southern California’s chaparral-covered hillsides, for example, hardening structures against ember storms can offer significant protection, according to experts.
Arecent studyfrom UC San Diego found that homes built after the state’s wildfire building codes went into effect were significantly less likely to be destroyed in a large blaze. By comparison, states without such construction requirements, such as Colorado and Oregon, have seen rates of destruction remain relatively unchanged for decades.
“I am surprised at how clear it is in the data,” said Judson Boomhower, co-author of the report and environmental economist at UC San Diego. “It’s not often in social science that the answer just falls out like it did here.”
Dillender moved to Dulzura about seven years ago, purchasing an older home that had survived the deadly 2007 Harris fire. A trailer park right down the road was devastated by the90,440-acre blaze, which destroyed 548 structures and killed eight people.
The San Diego native believes strongly in the value of upgrading his home. He said nearby conflagrations regularly pepper the community with potentially dangerous ash and embers. While double-paned windows can keep flames and radiant heat from bursting into a home, sealing off eaves and vents reduce the likelihood that a barrage of firebrands will sneak in and explode the structure from the inside out.
“We’ve been doing the windows one at a time as we can afford it, and there’s like 20 in the house,” he said. “It’s rough.”
That’s why he volunteered to be California’s first participant in the new home-hardening pilot program. Beyond his drafty single-pane windows, woodpeckers have drilled sizable holes into an exterior wall, and the structure’s gapping ventilation system needs a major overhaul.
“It’s really going to help the people,” said Dillender, who now leads the Dulzura Fire Safe Council, a community-led group that educates residents and organizes defensible-space projects. “A lot of these people inherited these houses and don’t have the resources to take care of them.”
The California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection, or Cal Fire, chose the communities of Dulzura, Potrero and Campo based largely on their concentration of low-income residents living in older, fire-prone homes. The state is also starting to roll out the pilot in Shasta County. Residents with higher incomes can still qualify for the retrofits as long as they pay for a percentage of the work on a sliding scale.
The idea is to simultaneously revamp entire communities or subdivisions. Researchers have found that if even just one home catches fire, it can put the whole neighborhood at risk. Cal Fire has started taking applications atwildfiremititgation.caloes.ca.gov.
“Some people are onboard with free money,” said Cal Fire Assistant Deputy Director Daniel Berlant. “Others don’t want the government’s help. That’s going to be a challenge we’re working to overcome.”
One of those skeptical residents is Susan Gallegos, 65, who moved to Dulzura in the mid-1990s. The Harris fire wiped out three of her neighbors’ homes, but somehow her 500-square-foot, single-story ranch house was spared.
“I don’t have the money for it,” she said of upgrading her home, which lacks a concrete foundation. “Everything’s wood.”
Still, Gallegos said she’s concerned the program could hike her property taxes or trigger other code-compliance issues.
“My fixed income is very low,” she said. “I figure if my house burns down, I probably just sell the land and move on.”
Firefighting officials have said the process will not require the county to reassess properties. However, it’s possible that awarded funds could be taxed as income, an issue currently under discussion in the state Legislature.
Toni Luecht, 74, said she’ll likely participate in the retrofit program. She and her husband lost a previous home in the Harris fire.
“We have the defensible space that’s required, but the vents in the attic are not good,” said the Dulzura resident. “It’s scary because we’ve been through this before.”
Such upgrades are all the more pressing because it can be hard to evacuate these communities. State Route 94 is the only way in or out and notifying residents of an oncoming wildfire can be tricky. Heavy smoke often obscures satellite internet connections, while fire can damage cell phone towers in an area with already spotty service.
During the hot, windy summer months, Dillender said he monitors local firefighting activity using a scanner. He said the ham radio crackles over outdoor speakers, while he and his 10 hungry goats tend to the never-ending chore of maintaining the large property.
“It sounds crazy, but I have Cal Fire playing all day so I can hear the dispatch as it happens,” he said. “I would get out immediately at the first sign of fire.”
Heightening concerns, he said, people illegally crossing the border into the United States regularly make their way through his property. The U.S. Border Patrol has a strong presence in the area, operating a checkpoint along the highway and patrolling communities in their signature green and white SUVs.
“They make little fires up in those hills, day and night,” he said of those crossing the border illegally, pointing to the steep, rocky terrain southeast of his property. “All night long, the dogs bark.”
The most recent evidence that California’s extensive building codes prevent significant home loss during wildfire came from a UC San Diego studyreleasedin December through the National Bureau of Economic Research.
The research sought to assess the effects of rules put in place following the 1991 Oakland firestorm, which destroyed 2,900 structures and killed 25 people. As a result, lawmakers passed series of regulations requiring that construction in high-fire areas include ignition-resistant roofing.
The state bolstered its wildfire building codes again in 2008, mandating that new homes in high-risk areas use ignition-resistant materials for windows, doors, decks, eaves and siding. Ember-resistant vent screens were also required, under the new rules.
Researchers at UC San Diego looked at about 46,000 single-family homes in California exposed to large blazes between 2003 and 2020 to assess the effects of these stricter building codes.
About 70% of the roughly 7,900 houses built after 1997 that were included in the study survived. That compares with just 58% of the 38,000 dwellings built before 1998 that withstood wildfire.
Researchers also looked at homes exposed to wildfire during that timeframe in Arizona, Colorado, Oregon and Washington, states that have yet to mandate wildfire-resistant construction. The share of homes that survived intense conflagration was about 50%, regardless of when they were built.
“We don’t see the same kind of survival benefits for the homes in states outside of California,” said Boomhower of UC San Diego. “That’s what really convinced us that this is building codes.”
Perhaps surprisingly, it’s slightly less expensive to build a wildfire-resistant home, according to2018 reportby the research nonprofit Headwaters Economics. That’s largely because the cost of fire-resistant fiber-cement siding is cheaper than standard cedar-plank exteriors.
However, the equation becomes more complicated when talking about the value of retrofitting older homes. The report found that a full overhaul including roofing, vents, siding, doors and windows can cost upwards of $60,000.
That’s given Boomhower and other researchers pause about the best way to protect these older structures.
“I think there’s a lot of interesting questions about how much retrofitting is cost effective,” he said. “How can we get a really good bang for the buck?”
Alexandra Syphard, a highly regarded wildfire scientist based in San Diego, expressed similar concerns. She said it’s important that government officials triage projects based on their cost effectiveness.
For example, her research has shown that installing ember-resistant screen vents is often the single best thing one can do to project a home. After that, she recommends upgrading windows.
“Most homes are destroyed because of embers or radian heat causing spontaneous combustion,” Syphard said. “A single-pane window is likely to shatter in that heat.”
Cal Fire officials said they will be conducting individual home assessments to determine the most appropriate upgrades for each structure. Priority upgrades will start with vegetation management and proper vent screens.

U.N. climate panel says Great Barrier Reef — Earth’s largest living structure — is in crisis,https://www.latimes.com/world-nation/story/2022-02-28/un-climate-panel-says-great-barrier-reef-in-crisis,2022-02-28,"SYDNEY —It was the silence of the sea that first rattled the teenage snorkeler, followed by a sense of horror as she saw the coral below had been drained of its kaleidoscopic color. This once-vibrant site on Australia’s Great Barrier Reef — a site she’d previously likened to a busy capital city — had become a ghost town, the victim of yet another mass bleaching event.
On that day in 2020, Ava Shearer got out of the water and cried. Today, with the release of aUnited Nations climate reportthat paints a dire picture of the Great Barrier Reef’s future, the now-17-year-old marine science student and snorkeling guide wonders what will be left of the imperiled ecosystem by the time she finishes her degree at Australia’s James Cook University.
“I definitely worry about it,” says Shearer, who grew up along the World Heritage-listed natural wonder off Australia’s northeast coast. “I fear there might not be anything for me to study.”
There is much for the world to fear in Monday’sIntergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report, which bluntly states that the Great Barrier Reef is in crisis and suffering grave impacts from climate change, with frequent and severe coral bleaching caused by warming ocean temperatures. Theworst bleaching event, in 2016, affected over 90% of the reef, and a punishing succession of bleaching incidents has left the northern and middle portion of the reef system in a “highly degraded state,” the report said.
The Great Barrier Reef is the largest living structure on the planet — so large, in fact, that it is the only living thing on Earth visible from space. It stretches over 1,400 miles and is home to more than 1,500 species of tropical fish, plus dolphins, whales, birds and even giant, century-old clams. Pre-pandemic, it contributed 6.4 billion Australian dollars ($4.6 billion U.S.) to the economy every year, largely thanks to tourism, and typically supports around 64,000 jobs.
That bleaching will continue along the reef is a virtual certainty, according to the IPCC. Perhaps even more ominously, the report suggests it may simply be too late to stop bleaching entirely. Even if the global community achieves its goal of limiting future warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) since pre-industrial times, that still wouldn’t be sufficient to prevent more frequent mass bleaching events, though it may reduce their occurrence, the IPCC found.
Climate & Environment
Global heating is having dire effects on people and nature, the U.N. says, with urgent action needed to curb emissions and adapt to worsening effects.
The report predicts thatocean warming and marine heatwaveswill cause the loss and degradation of tropical shallow coral reefs, leading to “widespread destruction” of coral reef ecosystems. The report points to three previousmass bleaching events from 2016 to 2020that caused significant coral loss, and warns that there has been “mass mortality” of some coral species.
For those who struggle to understand how devastating bleaching is, diver Tony Fontes likens it to a wildfire under the ocean. Fontes, who recently retired after 40 years as a diving instructor on the Great Barrier Reef, remembers diving on reefs that had recently been bleached and swimming through water that had turned milky-white from dead coral tissue. He would emerge covered in slime.
“You sit on the boat trying to wash it off and you just realize you’ve just swum across a reef that a couple weeks ago was full of life and vibrant and now a bushfire has gone through it and the coral is dead, and the rest of the marine life will just have to move on or die off,” he says. “It’s a really, really sad, heart-wrenching experience.”
Yet despite the looming threat in its own back yard, Australia has lagged behind other wealthy countries in its greenhouse gas emissions reduction performance and pledges. Last year, a climate think tank ranked Australia as the worst climate performer among comparable developed countries since nations pledged in the 2015 Paris climate agreement to limit global warming.
The issue is politically fraught in Australia, which is one of the world’s largest exporters of coal and liquified natural gas, and one of the highest greenhouse gas emitters per capita because of its heavy reliance on coal-fired power. Last month, the government pledged to spend another  $1 billion over nine years on improving the reef’s health, but critics argued that the money would do nothing to address rising ocean temperatures, the main threat to coral.
World & Nation
A federal report warns that America’s coasts will be hit hard by ever faster sea level rise between now and 2050.
The consequences of inaction go beyond the ecological to the economical: If bleaching persists, the IPCC estimates 10,000 jobs and $1 billion in revenue would be lost every year from declines in tourism alone.
Around a billion people worldwide rely on coral reefs for their everyday living, says Scott Heron, a physics professor and reef science expert at James Cook University. Which is why, he says, a failure to urgently reduce greenhouse gas emissions could have devastating effects for humanity.
“It’s going to affect real people and real people’s lives,” Heron says. “It’s going to make a massive change to not just people in Australia, but people who subsist on reef services. And so we’re really putting this into a frame of endangering human life.”
Beyond the reef, the report warns that climate change will lead to a surge in heat-related deaths in Australia, the extinction of certain animal species, and more wildfires. Koalas are at risk of local extinctions due to increasing drought and rising temperatures, the IPCC said. And rising sea levels and storm surges led to the recent extinction of a rodent species called Bramble Cay melomys, which lived on a remote cay in the northern Great Barrier Reef, the report said.
California
The U.S. coastline is expected to experience as much sea level rise in the next 30 years as it did in the hundred years prior.
The frequency and severity of dangerous wildfire conditions are already increasing, due in part to climate change, the IPCC said, citing the catastrophic “Black Summer” fires of late 2019 and early 2020 that killed at least 33 people and destroyed more than 3,000 homes. Even Australia’s famed eucalyptus trees, which are naturally resilient to the country’s seasonal fires, may not be able to withstand the ferocity and frequency of the predicted blazes, which could lead to the decimation of forests, the IPCC warned.
“We’re seeing conditions which really weren’t projected for some decades ... and yet they’re appearing pretty much now, and so to some extent we could well be under-estimating the risks associated with things like fires,” says IPCC vice chair Mark Howden, director of the Institute for Climate, Energy and Disaster Solutions at the Australian National University.
Still, despite the grim predictions, Howden urges Australians not to lose hope and to focus instead on solutions, primarily by reducing greenhouse gas emissions, but also by reducing other reef stressors such as overfishing. The report also provides extensive lists of climate adaptation strategies, such as improving building standards so that homes stay cooler during potentially deadly heatwaves.
“Does this report identify whole areas Australians should be concerned about? Absolutely, and it would be hard to understate the comprehensiveness and significance of those impacts,” Howden says. “Does it also portray a whole series of things that we can take action on which take the sting out of the worst-case scenarios in the future? Absolutely.”

Los Angeles sues NoHo apartment owner over alleged gang activity,https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2022-02-25/los-angeles-sues-noho-apartment-owner-over-alleged-gang-activity,2022-02-25,"On a nondescript stretch of Vanowen Street in North Hollywood sits a squat yellow apartment complex that spans an entire city block.
The complex, which holds 116 units, sits adjacent to a Catholic church and is about 450 feet from a middle school. It’s also an alleged stronghold of the North Hollywood Locos gang, according to a new nuisance abatement lawsuit filed by Los Angeles City Atty. Mike Feuer.
The suit, filed Feb. 15 in Los Angeles County Superior Court, alleges that there have been nine gang-related shootings at the complex in the last 15 months, with five occurring since December due to an “ongoing turf war” withrival gang MS-13.
“In our lawsuit, we allege that the owner — one of the largest landlords in California — and operator have allowed these incredibly dangerous conditions to persist,” Feuer said in a statement.
The complex is owned by Swaranjit “Mike” Nijjar, whose “billion-dollar real estate empire” consists of more than 1,000 units in the city alone, the suit says.
The complaint targets Nijjar and his company, Group IX BP Properties Inc., as well as the building’s management companies, Golden Management Services Inc. and Pama Management Inc. The director of Pama Management is Nijjar’s sister, Daljit Kler, according to court documents.
Representatives for Nijjar and Kler could not immediately be reached for comment.
California
Three people were slain within the blighted rooms of the MS-13 destroyer on Rampart Boulevard in 2017 and 2018, authorities said.
In a statement, Feuer,who is also running for mayor of L.A., accused the owner and operators of allowing gang-related violence and dangerous activities to occur regularly at the property.
Nijjar took ownership of the complex — which is composed of 12 two-story buildings in the 13100 and 13200 blocks of Vanowen Street — in 2001.
“The violence at and around this gang-ridden property has got to stop now,” Feuer said. “It’s so bad that the church next door had to suspend youth activities during this recent outbreak of shootings to keep young congregants out of harm’s way, then erect a metal barrier to deflect bullets.”
According to the complaint, members of the NH Locos gang have tagged the building with graffiti to “make clear to the tenants, community members and rivals that the gang claims control of the property and will aggressively and violently defend it.”
In one incident last December, two victims were robbed on the sidewalk in front of the property after gang members placed guns to their foreheads, the suit says. After the robbery, one of the suspects opened fire and struck a victim in the hip and foot before fleeing into the property.
In a separate incident in October, approximately 60 children were playing in the parking lot at the nearby St. Paul Assyrian Chaldean Catholic Church when a stray bullet whizzed overhead, the suit says. A stray bullet also passed through a church window in May 2020.
Gang members have also attempted to recruit students on their walk to the nearby James Madison Middle School, the suit alleges. The school is attended by more than 1,600 sixth-, seventh- and eighth-graders.
“No tenant in this city should be forced to live in the kind of conditions that have existed at 13100 Vanowen,” Los Angeles City Councilman Paul Krekorian said in a statement.
Krekorian, whose district includes North Hollywood, added that “despite our work to uplift this neighborhood, the owner of this property has continued to fail to keep the tenants safe.”
California
Two L.A. politicians jumped into the mayor’s race early. But are they now in danger of being drowned out?
Feuer said he is asking the court to order Nijjar to live in the complex until an array of improvements have been implemented, including the installation of secure fencing and video monitoring systems.
“Let him learn what it’s like to live with shooting after shooting, because that’s what the hard-working families at this property endure all the time,” Feuer said.
Other requested changes include improved screening of tenants and the addition of security guards. The suit also seeks civil penalties against Nijjar and Kler.
It’s not the first time the city attorney has taken action against the owner.
In 2017, Feuer sued Nijjar forsimilar gang-related nuisancesat another property, the 415-unit Chesapeake Apartments in Baldwin Village. That case was settled after court-mandated improvements were made, he said.
In announcing the suit this week, Feuer urged the city’s residents to report unsafe and violent conditions in their neighborhoods.

Proposed regulations would compel insurers to account for wildfire mitigation efforts,https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2022-02-25/proposed-regulations-would-compel-insurers-to-account-for-wildfire-mitigation-efforts,2022-02-25,"Insurance providers in California will have to incorporateproactive wildfire mitigation effortsinto their rates for homeowners and businesses underproposed new regulations, state officials announced Friday.
The regulations, which could be in effect as soon as this summer, are intended to drive down skyrocketing insurance costs for residents in wildfire-prone areas and improve the safety of communities in their paths.
The plan is largely a response to consumers’ complaints that insurance companies have been unwilling to give ratepayers credit  for steps taken to lower the risks of loss and damage, such as installing fire-resistant roofs or clearing combustible vegetation from properties, Insurance Commissioner Ricardo Lara said.
“With more Californians rolling up their sleeves and reaching into their own pockets to protect their homes and businesses, insurance pricing must reflect their efforts,” he said in a statement.
The proposed rules will incorporate the new “Safer from Wildfires” framework unveiled by the state’s Department of Insurance last week, which outlines a list of expert-recommended actions homeowners and governments can take to better protect themselves from fires.
Business
State fire, insurance and emergency response officials release guidelines for keeping your home safer from wildfires.
Under the current rules, insurers can assign properties “wildfire risk scores” based on their level of risk, such as vegetation, slope or  firefighter access. Generally speaking, higher wildfire risk corresponds to a higher insurance premium.
But those scores often fail to account for  measures property owners and communities are taking to reduce those risks, officials said. Currently, only 17 insurance companies representing 40% of the insurance marketplace offer discounts for such efforts.
What’s more, insurers can sometimes assign wildfire risk scores based on incorrect or outdated data. For example, if an insurance company mistakenly assumes that a home has a wood shingle roof — which is known to pose an extreme risk in the event of a wildfire — the company could charge a much higher premium.
The proposed regulations will allow  property owners  to review their risk scores and other factors used to calculate their premiums  and appeal them if desired.
“Holding insurance companies accountable for accurately rating wildfire risk in the premiums they charge Californians will help save lives and reduce losses,” Lara said.
The regulations will lead to a more competitive market and ensure that rates and premiums aren’t excessive or unfair, he said.
California
A United Nations report on the growth of extreme wildfires worldwide suggests California can do more to increase fire resiliency.
They will also incentivize property owners to make the mitigation efforts, which are becoming increasingly necessary and urgent as the state’s wildfires growhotter, larger and more intense.
Thefire season is also growing longereach year due to drought, heat and other impacts of climate change — and wildfires are expected to geteven worse in the years to come.
Experts have noted that population growth, demand for housing, urban development and land-use practices are pushing more people and homes into the wildland-urban interface. Mitigation efforts will improve safety for not only individual homes and businesses, but also their surrounding communities.
“By rewarding homeowners and businesses for the wildfire safety actions they take, these regulations will be a huge assist to our efforts to prevent the severe loss of life and property from wildfires like we saw in thedevastating Thomas fireand debris flow that followed,” Montecito Fire Chief Kevin Taylor said in a statement about the proposed regulations.
The Thomas fire seared through 280,000 acres and burned more than 1,000 structures in Santa Barbara and Ventura counties in 2017 and 2018. More than 20 people werekilled by debris flowsfollowing the blaze.
Lara said he was prompted to take action in part after hearing from consumers during a virtual hearing in October 2020. Many people in the meeting said they were frustrated by opaque policies and a lack of consideration for their efforts.
“The use of a fire score for rating and underwriting is problematic,” Richard Dinon, a 20-year resident of the San Bernardino Mountains, said during the meeting. “There’s no transparency for the insured customer to make an assessment of the validity of the formula, the currency of the data or the consistency of the application to their properties.”
El Dorado County resident Chris Swarbrick, who is also a member of the county’s Fire Protection District, said his rates had increased by 430% in two years, and that many residents in the community had been unable to get insurers to visit their properties to assess home hardening efforts. Some were seeing policy quotes of as much as $20,000 a year.
“The stories of the the exorbitant amounts are very, very real,” he said.
The public can weigh in on the proposed new regulations in writing or atahearing in Oakland on April 13that will be  streamed online.

California lawmakers want to build more clean energy — and faster,https://www.latimes.com/environment/newsletter/2022-03-31/california-lawmakers-want-to-build-more-clean-energy-and-faster-boiling-point,2022-03-31,"This is the March 31, 2022, edition of Boiling Point, a weekly newsletter about climate change and the environment in California and the American West.Sign up hereto get it in your inbox.
Remember last month, when Ifoolishly tasked myselfwith summarizing all the climate- and environment-related bills that had been introduced in the California Legislature this year, only to grossly underestimate how much legislation I would find?
Well, it’s time for Part 2. This week we’re running through 25 bills dealing with clean energy, the electric grid and climate-friendly transportation. The same caveat as last time applies: This is far from a comprehensive list, so please forgive me if I’ve missed a bill that’s close to your heart. I’ll be writing at least one more legislative roundup, so pleasesend me an emailwith suggestions.
Alright, here we go:
SB 833: As climate-fueled wildfires and heat wavesraise the risk of power outagesin California, many homes and businesses have turned todiesel generatorsto keep the lights on — exacerbating the climate crisis, because diesel is a fossil fuel. This bill would seek toslow that trendby setting up an “energy resilience” grant program, in which local governments would get funding to figure out how they can use clean energy resources — such as solar panels, batteries andmicrogrids— to ride out blackouts.
SB 1075/SB 1463: Iwrote last weekabout the potential for green hydrogen to help replace fossil fuels in Los Angeles — and the many potential pitfalls. The first of these bills would set up a “clean hydrogen hub” fund within the state treasury, and require energy regulators to study hydrogen’s benefits; the second would establish a “fueling hub” to help heavy-duty trucks fill up with hydrogen instead of diesel at either the Port of Los Angeles or the Port of Long Beach, an ideasupported by local officials.
SB 1376: California needs to dramatically pick up the pace of building clean power plants — including solar, wind andgeothermalfacilities — to have any hope of meeting its emissions goals. This bill would require the Energy Commission to develop a plan for connecting six gigawatts of climate-friendly energy resources to the state’s power grid every year, beginning in 2025 — four times what California has averaged over the last decade and roughly in line withwhat is neededto reach 100% clean energy by 2045.
AB 2204: Helping fossil fuel workers transition to new jobs is crucial to the clean energy transition — both because it’s the right thing to do and because workers who see a secure future for themselves are much more likely toprovide political supportfor climate policies. This bill would establish the Office of Clean Energy Workforce, tasked with creating or coordinating programs “to retrain and upskill workers for clean energy jobs, and plan and support the physical relocation of the fossil fuel-based workforce.”
AB 2587: California won’t eliminate fossil fuels with solar and wind power alone. The state will also need some amount of “firm” clean energy resources — such asgeothermal,long-duration storageorhydrogen— that can keep the lights on during therare but inevitable multiday periodswhen there’s not enough wind and sunshine to go around. But state agencies have been slow to require utility companies to invest in those (relatively expensive) resources. This bill would prod the agencies to get a move on.
SB 884: Power lines have caused some of California’s deadliest wildfires, and the worst utility offender — Pacific Gas & Electric — wants to prevent further ignitions by spendingtens of billions of dollarsburying thousands of miles of wires. This bill would help PG&E and other utilities speed up that “undergrounding” process by requiring local governments to approve or deny construction permits within 150 days, and by pushing courts to resolve lawsuits within 270 days. It would also stop utility companies from profiting on undergrounding projects if the buried wires continue to spark wildfires or requirefire-related electricity shutoffs.
SB 887: To achieve 100% clean electricity by 2045 — orperhaps sooner— the Golden State will need a massive buildout of power lines to bring climate-friendly energy from large solar and wind farms to major cities. This bill would try to jumpstart theslow process of building new transmissionby pushing regulatory agencies — including the Public Utilities Commission and the California Independent System Operator — to identify the highest-priority power-line projects and begin approving them.
SB 1032: Maybe a new state agency could get transmission lines built more quickly and at a lower cost? This bill would create the Clean Energy Infrastructure Authority, modeled after a New Mexico agency that clean energy advocates say has hadreal successat opening up new electricity corridors. The authority would have the power to acquire land through eminent domain, conduct environmental reviews and borrow money at a lower rate than private utilities, in theory leading to lower costs for consumers.
SB 1174: Another effort to speed up construction of electric wires. This one would require state officials to approve all power-line projects that support the buildout ofclean energy projects that help keep the lights on. It would also waive penalties for electricity providers that fail to line up reliable supplies because of a third party’s inability to get a transmission project completed on time.
SB 1274: This bill would allow streamlined environmental reviews for transmission lines meant to serve offshore wind farms within or adjacent to Humboldt County, on the state’s North Coast. Local officials hope offshore windwill bring economic revitalization.
SB 379: There’s afierce debateover rooftop solar incentives — but most of the combatants seem to agree that it’s way too hard for Californians to get approval to add solar panels to their homes. This bill would require most cities and counties to adopt automated online permitting, most likely though a tool calledSolarAPP+. “I’m sure when dishwashers were first invented, there were concerns about impacts on the plumbing system. But we don’t require permits for something like a dishwasher or washing machine now,” the bill’s author, Scott Wiener, told me. “I think simple solar and storage systems are moving in that direction.”
SB 1385: It’s also pretty well-established that going solar is easier for single-family homeowners with cash to spare than it is for lower-income families living in apartments. This bill would require the Public Utilities Commission to create a new program offering financial incentives for solar-plus-storage systems that serve residents of multifamily housing units. The incentives would be available for multifamily housing that serves low-income families or is located in an underserved community — or a high-fire-threat zone where the combination of solar and batteries could help keep the lights on during apublic safety power shutoff.
SB 1430: Most new homes built in California are now required to include solar panels, under aregulationapproved by the Energy Commission in 2018. This bill would suspend that regulation until 2030 in an effort to reduce the state’s soaring housing costs.
AB 2316: Another solution that many clean energy advocates agree on is community solar — small facilities that serve renters and apartment-dwellers who can’t install solar panels and homeowners who can’t afford to. Californiahasn’t offered much supportfor community solar, but this bill would change that, requiring the Public Utilities Commission to set up an incentive program.
SB 1010/SB 1305: The first bill would require 100% of vehicles purchased by state agencies to be zero-emission by 2027. The second would rewrite an existing regulation to make it easier for those agencies to buy all-electric light-duty cars in particular.
SB 1482/AB 1738: If California wants to end the sale of gasoline-powered cars by 2035 — the goaladopted by Gov. Gavin Newsom— people will need easier access to electric vehicle charging stations. The first of these bills would begin to tackle that challenge by requiring all newly built multifamily homes to offer at least one electric vehicle charger for each unit with access to a parking spot. The second would require many home developers to add charging stations during retrofits of existing multifamily buildings.
AB 1814: A quarter of Californians now get their electricity fromcommunity choice aggregators, or CCAs — local governments that have banded together to buy power for their residents. But unlike monopoly utility companies, CCAs can’t apply for certain state funds to help clean up the transportation sector, such as money to build electric vehicle chargers. This bill would change that.
AB 2061: California has spent billions of dollars subsidizing electric cars, including charging stations — but it’s not clear how often those charging stations might be malfunctioning. This bill would address that, requiring utilities and other entities that receive public funding for EV chargers to report “uptime,” aka how often those stations are actually functioning. It would also task state officials with determining whether certain areas — particularly low-income neighborhoods — face more downtime than others.
AB 2075: This bill would require the California Energy Commission to develop electric vehicle charging standards for all new building construction and retrofits — much as it already does with energy efficiency, water efficiency and rooftop solar standards.
SB 922: Two years ago, lawmakers passed a bill exempting climate-friendly transportation projects — including bike lines, safe walking paths, public transit stations and electric bus infrastructure — from the strict reviews typically required under the California Environmental Quality Act. But the CEQA exemptions run only through Jan. 1, 2023. This bill would extend them by seven years, removing anironic obstacleto projects designed to slow the climate crisis and limit asthma-inducing local air pollution.
SB 932: I’ve written previously aboutsafe streetsthat not only protect walkers and bikers from vehicle traffic but also help the climate, by making it easier for people to get out of their cars. This bill would promote that type of urban design by requiring city and county governments to plan for new bike paths and walkways, including in areas with high numbers of traffic injuries.
AB 2097: In Los Angeles and other car-centric cities, parking lots gobble up vast amounts of land that could be used for apartment buildings, green space or outdoor dining. This bill wouldtake a crackat that dynamic by prohibiting local governments from requiring developers to include a minimum number of off-street parking spots in residential or commercial projects — as long as those projects are within half a mile of a major public transit stop, or a “high-quality transit corridor” with frequent bus service.
So many bills! And so many more that I’ve yet to review.Until then, here’s what else is happening around the West:
California’s Low Carbon Fuel Standard set off a biofuel boom that’s beginning to reshape the agriculture industry.Check outthis great piece by my colleague Evan Halperon the pros and cons of plant- and animal-based diesel, jet fuel and natural gas sourced from farms. Oil and gas companies tout these fuels as climate-friendly, but some environmentalists are skeptical — much as they are about hydrogen, another potentially clean fuel that Iwrote about last week. One way or another, scientists say, fossil fuels must go — a point driven home by new research out of New Mexico’s Permian Basin, where an industry-funded study foundway higher methane emissionsfrom oil and gas operations than expected, as Morgan Lee of the Associated Press reports.
Gov. Gavin Newsom wants local governments to require more aggressive water conservation — but he’s still not mandating any cutbacks himself.Here’s the latest drought updatefrom my colleagues Hayley Smith and Jonah Valdez, who write that this week’s Southern Californiarainstormwas “far short of a drought-busting March miracle.” The storm followed a heat wave that broughtrecord temperaturesto the L.A. area — the kind of summer-like weather that is becoming increasingly common as the world heats up, as The Times’ Patt Morrison notes in acolumnon how the region’s gorgeous springs are changing. In the California desert, meanwhile, water agencies are poised to allow construction of surf parks, an ice hockey area and a lagoon-centric Disney development despite the drought — andit’s all perfectly legal, the Desert Sun’s Janet Wilson explains.
Regulators are approving wildfire safety plans from Pacific Gas & Electric and other utilities that they know are “seriously deficient,” according to California’s state auditor.Regulators, the auditor found, haven’t done enough to ensure that PG&E, Southern California Edison and San Diego Gas & Electric are prioritizing infrastructure safety upgrades in the highest-risk areas,Julie Cart writes for CalMatters. Maybe the companies should ask goats for help? I’m only mostly kidding; there are currently 400 goats along the Sacramento River,munching on overgrown vegetation to reduce wildfire risk, per my colleague Nathan Solis.
Former Black employees of Tesla’s electric vehicle factory in Fremont, Calif., describe a culture of pervasive racism, saying they were abused with racial slurs from supervisors and co-workers, ordered to carry out demeaning and dangerous work and in some cases fired if they spoke up.Here’s the storyfrom The Times’ Margot Roosevelt and Russ Mitchell, which follows adiscrimination lawsuitfiled against the Elon Musk-led company by state officials. Tesla has denied the allegations in their entirety.
State regulators arrived at an oil drilling site in South L.A. with a warrant, a locksmith and bolt cutters this week after Allenco Energy canceled an inspection.It’s the latest development in the long-running saga of the Allenco site, which is near the University of Southern California and once spewed noxious fumes that nearby residents said gave them nosebleeds, headaches and respiratory problems,as my colleague Nathan Solis reports. Allenco has refused to pay for plugging the dormant oil wells.
There’s an appalling lack of green space at many Los Angeles schools, depriving students of comfortable play areas and contributing to higher temperatures in certain neighborhoods — especially those home to many Asian, Black and Latino residents.Tony Barboza, a member of The Times’ editorial board,wrote a commentary pieceon the benefits of replacing schoolyard asphalt with grass, trees, shaded outdoor classrooms and other living landscapes that can also limit urban heat.
Five years after ditching Utah because of the state’s efforts to undo Bears Ears and Grand Staircase-Escalante national monuments, the Outdoor Retailer trade show is returning to the Beehive State.But Patagonia, REI, the North Face and other companiesintend to boycott, Brian Maffly and Daedan Olander report for the Salt Lake Tribune. In more national monument news, four Nevada tribes want to protect 3 million acres of federal land that might otherwise be overrun by an expanded Navy bombing and training range. The proposed Numu Newe National Monument would be the country’slargest monument on land, Chris D’Angelo writes for HuffPost. In Texas, meanwhile, Interior Secretary Deb Haaland visited El Paso’s Castner Range, which local advocates also want to see protected as a monument. Martha Pskowski at the El Paso Timeswrote about Haaland’s visit.
Washington Gov. Jay Inslee vetoed sections of a bill that would have paused solar and wind farm approvals through December 2023 and created a process to give rural counties more input on where renewable energy projects are built.Details herefrom Annette Cary at the Tri-City Herald. Inslee did, however, sign a$17-billion transportation packagewith funds for electric ferries, walking and biking corridors and free public transit for kids, Laurel Demkovich reports for the Spokesman-Review.
A new analysis found the Bureau of Land Management didn’t conduct site-specific environmental analyses for more than half of the federal grazing permits it renewed last year.That lack of scrutiny could haveserious negative consequencesfor sage grouse and other wildlife dependent on rangeland habitat, Scott Streater writes for E&E News. And it’s not just rangelands in trouble — half a century after passage of the Clean Water Act, more than half of U.S. waterways are too polluted for swimming or fishing, with rivers in California and Oregongetting some of the worst marks, Theo Whitcomb writes for High Country News. I also learned a lot fromthis pieceby the San Luis Obispo Tribune’s Mackenzie Shuman about how hot water discharges from the Diablo Canyon nuclear plant — scheduled to close in 2025 — have changed the ecology of Diablo Cove along the Central California coast.
The three leading candidates for District 3 on Los Angeles County’s Board of Supervisors — Bob Hertzberg, Lindsey Horvath and Henry Stern — all have extensive climate credentials.But a recent debate highlightedkey differences in their environmental approaches, Ryan Carter reports for the L.A. Daily News. Hertzberg offered a more market-based vision of the clean energy transition, while Stern focused on shutting down fossil fuel infrastructure such as the Aliso Canyon gas storage field. Horvath emphasized her local government experience and the endorsement of environmental justice group Pacoima Beautiful.
Some Southern Californians are driving across the border for cheaper gasoline in Mexico.How has Mexico managed to keep gas prices (relatively) in check as Russia’s war on Ukraine roils global markets? Well, Mexican President Andrés Manuel López Obrador is providingsubsidies to oil companies and refineriesto keep gas prices under control, as Leila Miller and Alexandra Mendoza report for The Times. It’s only the latest example of AMLOstrengthening state controlover the energy industry.
The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission pulled back on a plan that would have required strict scrutiny of the climate impacts of new natural gas pipelines and export terminals.The agency’s backtrackingfollowed criticismfrom West Virginia Sen. Joe Manchin III and other fossil fuel supporters, the AP’s Matthew Daly reports. Manchin, meanwhile, is making a new push to get a climate bill through the Senate — butonly if it also promotesoil and gas leasing in the Gulf of Mexico, per the Washington Post’s Maxine Joselow, Anna Phillips and Tyler Pager. And if the U.S. does build more natural gas export terminals, by the way, they could not only harm the climate but alsodelicate habitat along the Gulf Coast, James Bruggers writes for Inside Climate News.
I was in the Phoenix area this weekend to see aDodgers spring training game, and as usual when I travel to Arizona, I couldn’t help but marvel at the region’s water infrastructure and seemingly endless urban sprawl, and wonder how sustainable it all is.
Just last week, the Census Bureau released data showing that Arizona’s Maricopa County gained more people last year than any other county in the U.S., as noted by Jonathan P. Thompsonin his Land Desk newsletter. And the nonprofit news outlet Circle of Blue just finished publishing afabulous three-part series by Keith Schneideron how the state so badly outgrew its water resources. Global warming hasn’t helped, of course. Temperatures reached the 90s while I was watching the Dodgers on Sunday.
So Arizona has problems. But then again, so does California. As I drove back to L.A., I glimpsed a Colorado River Aqueductpumping stationat the foot of the mountains north of Interstate 10. We, too, rely on water sources that arebecoming less reliable.

Letters to the Editor: Making rooftop solar more expensive won’t help anybody,https://www.latimes.com/opinion/letters-to-the-editor/story/2022-03-30/rooftop-solar-california-costs-regressive,2022-03-30,"To the editor:I can appreciate Mr. Borenstein’sargument for altering the current net metering policy, but take issue with several of his arguments. I’m not asserting that Southern California Edison is greedy, but the company is beholden to shareholders, not customers. Let’s not forget the shamefulSan Onofredebacle, where customers were held liable for millions to make up for a disgraceful mishandling of a defective nuclear facility, eventually shuttered.
Not all homeowners with rooftop solar are wealthy. I’m very much in the middle class, and was ready some years ago to install a sizable system to just do the right thing. Had the Coastal Commission not refused the plans, I’d have never broken even, but would feel great about my clean power. De-incentivizing any solar installation is killing the goose. Find a fair and reasonable wholesale price for consumer-generated power, advance subsidies for low-income residents and convert SCE to a true public utility that is responsive to public needs, not shareholders.
Greg Hilfman, Topanga
..
To the editor:When we got our first solar installation eight years ago, the size of the system was determined by our power usage, not the size of the roof. L.A. Department of Water and Power policies prevented us from producing more solar energy than we needed. Every month during all these years we paid a connectivity fee to the LADWP. A battery was not an option at the time. When our energy needs increased because we got a plug-in hybrid car, replaced the old gas heater with an electric heat pump and put in air-conditioning, our system was no longer big enough.
We recently installed a second system, this time with a battery backup. It’s not free, of course. I pay a monthly fee to lease that battery, never mind that it benefits others as well during peak energy times because I will be able to provide my own energy instead of using the overtaxed grid. So please, don’t tell me I’m a freeloader.
There is a climate crisis and we need to install as many solar panels as we can.
Ruth Honegger, Los Angeles
..
To the editor:Whether terribly poor or incredibly wealthy, anyone who cannot use rooftop solar pays more for the cost of the “grid” than those who can use rooftop.
Nevertheless, my rooftop solar contract with other parties is what it is. The terms and conditions of my contract were crucial to my decision to buy rooftop solar. It would be wrong for authorities to take away my net metering benefit without compensation.
If self-appointed do-gooders want to eliminate or reduce net metering rules for future agreements, that is up to them. I think that would be a mistake because it would hurt the quest to eliminate fossil fuel use and destroy a vibrant rooftop solar industry, and hugely upset all existing rooftop solar owners.
Mark Driskill, Long Beach
..
To the editor:Solar power costs less per unit produced than systems that rely on oil and gas, but lower costs do not control the profits made by utility companies. The energy costs per unit to poorer customers should drop, if discrimination and inequality in pricing did not place unequal burdens on geographic areas where people of color live. This unfair practice should cease with limits on price-gouging and unfair cost burdens to provide profits for shareholders or cheaper rates for wealthy people.
Karen Ashikeh, Long Beach
..
To the editor:California’s power utilities have failed the state. They are unreliable and dangerous (wildfires caused by neglected power lines have destroyed forests and homes and killed people). Now regulators have the nerve to punish those of us that have invested tens of thousands of our own hard-earned money into rooftop solar to have a more reliable power source, since in Simi Valley they shut off the grid anytime the wind kicks up.
California mandated as of Jan. 1, 2020, that most new home construction has to have rooftop solar power installed. The state is now wringing its hands over possibly paying us less for the excess generated electricity and making us pay a monthly grid connection fee. The California Public Utilities Commission must reject this atrocity of net metering 3.0 and make the power companies honor the original metering agreement that is good for the citizens of California.

A hiker’s heartbreak on returning to L.A.’s fire-ravaged mountains,https://www.latimes.com/opinion/story/2022-04-30/hiker-heartbreak-mountains-climate-change,2022-04-30,"Imagine if, every so often, a cataclysmic storm washed away a mile of beach. One year, the Santa Monica Pier — gone. Five or 10 years later, the cliffs overlooking Lunada Bay fall into the ocean. The scale of our climate emergency would be achingly clear to the legions of Angelenos who treasure our coast.
Something similar is happening in our mountains, where massive firestorms year after year are turning shaded trails into ashen hellscapes, permanently altering forests that have adapted over thousands of years to survive fire, but notthiskind of fire. A few weeks ago, I got my first intimate glimpse of this destruction on a trail that opened to hikers April 1, following a 16-month closure by the U.S. Forest Service after the last fire.
I’m talking not about the Sierra Nevada and its giant sequoia groves — though thedestruction there is grave— but rather the humble San Gabriel and San Bernardino mountains, right on our doorstep. These mountains, which top out at more than 11,000 feet, make people who live in Los Angeles and love to hike in thin air extremely lucky folks.
We hikers are a cheerful bunch. But the sense lately that our forests have been pushed beyond their ability to recover has turned many into anxiety-stricken doomsayers, ever worried that the next cloud of smoke rising over the mountains on a hot, windy day means the fire has finally come fortheirspot.
And the last fire did indeed come for my spot — or I should say our spot, since it was a place I enjoyed with my three young children only months before the Bobcat fire stripped it of its foliage. That fire, from September to December 2020,scorched roughly 115,000 acres; it was the second-largest wildfire on record in Los Angeles County, occurring only 11 years after the 2009 Station fire, whichburned more than160,000 acres(about the size of the city of Chicago). In fact, some areas of the forest were still recovering from the Station fire when the Bobcat fire devastated them again.
Now, I know burns are often beneficial to forests, but what came through much of the trail I hiked two weeks ago, high in the San Gabriels off Angeles Crest Highway, was cataclysmic. The dense forest was reduced to burned trunks that from a distance looked like blackened toothpicks. The nearby highway, once hidden from view by healthy trees, was almost always visible, as if to remind hikers of the fossil-fuel consumption driving this destruction.
Still, about halfway into the hike, there were signs of survival and renewal. An area that I feared had been damaged looked almost unscathed. Other hikers were enjoying this section of the trail, perhaps thankful as I was. This contrast — between being utterly unprepared for the destruction I saw and pleasantly surprised by what remained — prompted me to check in with an expert about this forest and these mountains, just to see if I was being alarmist.
“Sadly, no,” said Alan Coles, a 30-year U.S. Forest Service volunteer who spends most of his weekends working on public trails. “Because it’s the plants that adapt to the climate, not the climate that adapts to the plants.”
I knew of Coles from hisletters to The Timesabout forest management and hiscontributions to an online trail guide. He has scouted some of the areas hit particularly hard by the Bobcat fire, working with trail restoration crews to allow for safe public access to the forest in time for the April 1 reopening (parts of the Bobcat fire burn area remain closed). He told me the area I saw, about 6,700 feet in elevation, was hit hard, so the pines and firs there were almost completely killed off, leaving little chance of recovery.
Over the coming years, he said, the dead trees will fall, probably to be replaced by lower-lying chaparral. He pointed out places where this is already happening, in areas burned by the 2009 Station fire and previous disasters. Throw in global warming and the droughts and wildfires to come that will surpass what we can imagine now, and it’s hard to imagine future wanderers enjoying the generous tree canopies that shade our mountain climbs on sunny days.
My conversation with Coles felt at times like an impromptu grief counseling session. We traded stories of places permanently changed, animals and plants disappearing from the forest, and our experiences with the dreadedpoodle dog bush(it’s a “fire follower” growing everywhere now, and under no circumstances should you touch it).
With much of the Bobcat fire burn area reopened and the summer hiking season about the begin, Coles and other trail workers want visitors to understand the forest is still in recovery: So stay on the trail, pack out trash, keep dogs leashed and — for the love of God — avoid starting the next fire.
As we were leaving the San Gabriels recently, I told my three children to look around and try to imprint on their memories what they were experiencing at that moment — the smells, the breeze, the rocky ridgeline trapping the last rays of daylight. Remember it, because every visit to the mountains could be your final goodbye to the forest you know.

California promised to close its last nuclear plant. Now Newsom is reconsidering,https://www.latimes.com/environment/story/2022-04-29/california-promised-to-close-its-last-nuclear-plant-now-newsom-is-reconsidering,2022-04-29,"With the threat of power shortages looming and the climate crisis worsening, Gov. Gavin Newsom may attempt to delay the long-planned closure of California’s largest electricity source: the Diablo Canyon nuclear plant.
Newsom told the L.A. Times editorial board Thursday that the state would seek out a share of $6 billion in federal funds meant to rescue nuclear reactors facing closure, money the Biden administrationannouncedthis month. Diablo Canyon owner Pacific Gas & Electric is preparing to shutter the plant — which generated 6% of the state’s power last year — by 2025.
“The requirement is by May 19 to submit an application, or you miss the opportunity to draw down any federal funds if you want to extend the life of that plant,” Newsom said. “We would be remiss not to put that on the table as an option.”
He said state officials could decide later whether to pursue that option. And a spokesperson for the governor clarified that Newsom still wants to see the facility shut down long term. It’s been six years since PG&E agreed to close the plant near San Luis Obispo, rather than invest in expensive environmental and earthquake-safety upgrades.
But Newsom’s willingness to consider a short-term reprieve reflects a shift in the politics of nuclear power after decades of public opposition fueled by high-profile disasters such as Chernobyl and Three Mile Island, as well as the Cold War.
Nuclear plants are America’s largest source of climate-friendly power, generating 19% of the country’s electricity last year. That’salmost as muchas solar panels, wind turbines, hydropower dams and all other zero-carbon energy sources combined.

Diablo Canyon is the state’s largest clean energy source. Will emissions rise after it closes?
Arecent UC Berkeley pollco-sponsored by The Times found that 44% of California voters support building more nuclear reactors in in the Golden State, with 37% opposed and 19% undecided — a significant change from the 1980s and 1990s.
The poll also found that 39% of voters oppose shutting down Diablo Canyon, with 33% supporting closure and 28% unsure.
Nuclear supporters say closing plants such as Diablo would make it far more difficult to achieve President Biden’s goal of 100% clean energy by 2035, and to mostly eliminate planet-warming emissions by midcentury — which is necessary to avert the worst impacts of climate change, including more dangerous heat waves, wildfires and floods, according to scientists.
Nuclear plants can produce power around the clock. Thestunning growth of lithium-ion battery storagehas made it easier and cheaper for solar panels and wind turbines to do the same, but those renewables still play much less of a role when the sun isn’t shining and wind isn’t blowing, at least for now.
The U.S. Commerce Department, meanwhile, is consideringtariffs on imported solar panels, which could hinder construction of clean energy projects that California is counting on to avoid blackouts the next few summers, as Diablo and several gas-fired power plants shut down. Newsom said in aletterto Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo this week that her department’s tariff inquiry has delayed at least 4,350 megawatts of solar-plus-storage projects — about twice the capacity of Diablo Canyon.

He urged Raimondo to “take immediate action to resolve this issue as soon as possible.”
“This Department of Commerce tariff issue is one of the biggest stories in the country,” Newsom told The Times’ editorial board. “Looking at retroactive 250% tariffs for everything coming out of Malaysia or Vietnam, and Taiwan, elsewhere — this is serious.”
The governor said he’s been thinking about keeping Diablo open longer since August 2020, when California’s main electric grid operator was forced toimplement rolling blackoutsduring an intense heat wave. Temperatures stayed high after sundown, leaving the state without enough electricity to keep air conditioners humming after solar farms stopped producing.
A few hundred thousand homes and businesses lost power over two evenings, none of them for longer than 2½ hours at a time, officials said. The state onlynarrowly avoidedmore power shortfalls during another heat storm a few weeks later, highlighting the fragility of an electric grid undergoing a rapid transition from fossil fuels to renewable energy.
Newsom spokesperson Anthony York said the governor’s decision to reconsider Diablo Canyon’s closure timeline was driven by projections of possible power shortages in the next few years. Those projections, he said, came from the California Independent System Operator, which oversees the electric grid for most of the state.
Anne Gonzales, a spokesperson for the grid operator, couldn’t immediately provide the projections. She said in an email that the agency supports “considering and exploring all options” for keeping the lights on, as doing so gets harder due to climate impacts including more extreme heat waves, more aggressive wildfires and hydropower supplies diminished by drought.
Newsom told the editorial board that reliable electricity is “profoundly important.” He also acknowledged thegrowing numberof scientists, activists andformer U.S. energy secretarieswho have pressed him to rescue Diablo for climate reasons.
“Some would say it’s the righteous and right climate decision,” Newsom said.
Climate & Environment
The Santa Susana Field Laboratory is the subject of a new documentary, “In the Dark of the Valley.”
Extending the plant’s closure deadline — PG&E is on track to shutter the first reactor in 2024, and the second in 2025 — wouldn’t be easy even with funding from the Biden administration. The federal Nuclear Regulatory Commission would need to hurry to renew Diablo’s operating license. Newsom suggested several state agencies would need to be involved, too — as well as the Legislature, which last yeardeclined to even give a committee voteto a bill designed to keep Diablo Canyon open.
For Newsom to extend Diablo’s life, he would also need PG&E’s cooperation in applying for federal funds. The company committed to closing the plant in 2016, when itstruck a dealwith environmental groups and its own union workforce to get out of the nuclear business — a decision that was eventuallyendorsed by regulatorsand lawmakers.
Asked whether PG&E is open to changing course on Diablo, spokesperson Lynsey Paulo said in an email that the company is “always open to considering all options to ensure continued safe, reliable, and clean energy delivery to our customers.”
“PG&E is committed to California’s clean energy future, and as a regulated utility, we are required to follow the energy policies of the state,” Paulo said.
Newsom said he’s asked PG&E to consider what it would take to keep Diablo Canyon open longer, including the possible role of federal funds.
“Based on the conversations we’ve been having with PG&E, it’s not their happy place,” he said.
The company declined to comment on how federal funds might be used to Diablo’s benefit. State officials have previously told The Times that operating Diablo past 2025 would require billions of dollars of upgrades to comply with earthquake safety rules, and with environmental regulations governing the use ofocean water for power-plant cooling.
To Ralph Cavanagh — co-director of the clean energy program at the Natural Resources Defense Council, and a key architect of the 2016 deal to shut down Diablo Canyon — applying for federal funds would be a fool’s errand.
Cavanagh said it’s his understanding that only certain types of power companies with specific economic challenges are eligible for the nuclear funding, and PG&E isn’t one of them. The infrastructure bill approved by Congress last year — which set aside the money Newsom is interested in seeking — says funds are only available to nuclear plants that compete in a “competitive electricity market,” which Diablo Canyon does not.
York, Newsom’s spokesperson, acknowledged in a text message that there’s “some question about whether Diablo is eligible” for the federal money, and that “PG&E would need to talk to” the federal Energy Department to get more clarity.
Cavanagh also said solar, storage and other clean energy resources could replace Diablo cheaply and reliably, as envisioned in the 2016 deal. As for the supply chain and tariff issues that have slowed solar and battery storage projects, he pointed out that both of Diablo’s reactors will still be online through summer 2024, with the second sticking around until August 2025.
“We have time to get our arms around that,” he said.

While NRDC supports keeping some nuclear plants operating where safety risks are lower, the technology’s fiercest critics argue nuclear is fundamentally unsafe. They consider Diablo Canyon especially risky because it’s near several seismic fault lines along California’s Central Coast. As far back as the 1970s — when then-Gov. Jerry Brown protested the plant’s construction — Diablo has stirred fears of an earthquake-driven meltdown spreading deadly radiation across the state.
Nuclear waste is another concern. In the absence of a permanent underground storage repository for spent fuel, radioactive waste is piling up at power plants across the country, including the shutteredSan Onofre facilityalong the coast in San Diego County.
Rescuing Diablo Canyon is far from California’s only option for averting blackouts.
There are many other steps the state might take — and in many cases is actively taking — tokeep the lights on after sundownthe next few summers, such as adding batteries to the grid,paying homes to use less energyand coordinating electricity suppliesmore closelywith other Western states. Longer-term options include investing ingeothermal energyandoffshore wind.
Newsom told The Times’ editorial board he plans to announce a “resilience fund” in next month’s update to his annual budget proposal, to pay for projects that would help avoid rolling blackouts the next few years.
But the governor also thinks keeping Diablo Canyon around at least a little while longer is worth considering, despite the political backlash it might provoke. He pointed to modeling by the state’s Public Utilities Commission and Independent System Operator showing that worsening heat waves — fueled by climate change — aremaking it harder to keeps the light on.
“We threw out the old playbook. We’re going to worst-case scenario,” he said. “We are being very sober.”
Supporting nuclear is a key climate priority for the Biden administration. But federal officials hadn’t seemed optimistic PG&E would apply for a share of the Energy Department’s$6-billion nuclear bailout fund. During a visit to Southern California last week, Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholmtold reportersshe’s “not sure that the community [around] Diablo Canyon is on board yet.”

LAX sees 1 million monthly international travelers for first time since pandemic’s start,https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2022-04-28/lax-international-travelers-rebounding-pandemic,2022-04-29,"Los Angeles International Airport saw more than 1 million international passengers in March, the first time its monthly tally has hit that mark since the beginning of the pandemic in 2020, airport officials said Thursday.
The increase comes as both domestic and international air travel continues to rebound from the pandemic.
“We saw things trending upward over the course of the year,” Los Angeles World Airports Chief Executive Justin Erbacci said Thursday.
The international numbers seen last month are 206% above the passenger total of March 2021, according to data provided by Los Angeles World Airports, which operates LAX and Van Nuys Airport.
Meanwhile, domestic travel continues to expand at a rapid pace with 4.1 million passengers reported in March, up 82% over March 2021.
LAX saw 13.2 million total passengers between January and March, up 122% from the same time period last year.
In 2021, 48 million passengers traveled through LAX, down from 88 million in 2019.
California
The increase in coronavirus cases is “pretty significant,” a top official said, underscoring the importance of vaccinations, booster shots and masks.
The airport had estimated it would see 45 million to 46 million domestic and international passengers at LAX for the 2021-22 fiscal year, Erbacci said. To date, the airport has seen around 43 million passengers.
“We’re trending ahead of our forecasted numbers,” Erbacci said. “And we expect if things continue as we think they will we will easily exceed our forecasted passenger numbers.”
A full recovery in international numbers is hindered by still-stringent COVID-19 restrictions in Asia, Erbacci said, adding that travel between Europe and the U.S. has been stronger.
“We see increased travel from Asian countries because we are an Asian gateway and we depend heavily on those passengers,” Erbacci said.
Demand for European destinations has been strong enough for LAX to launch new routes to Paris and Frankfurt through “low-cost” international airlines this spring, Erbacci said, adding that budget carriers were among the first to resume such international routes.
Though passengers have largely returned, airlines are facing challenges in hiring enough pilots to meet the increased demand.
“You will have seen that most of the U.S. carriers have already canceled some of their flights that they had on the summer schedule,” Erbacci said.
“The demand is there to be strong, very strong, this summer, but I think that it will be limited by the supply that the airlines are able to provide,” he said.

"Gusts, dryness could fan spring U.S. wildfires again",https://www.latimes.com/world-nation/story/2022-04-28/gusts-dryness-could-fan-spring-u-s-wildfires-again,2022-04-28,"ALBUQUERQUE —More of the dry, windy weather that helped fan rare spring wildfires from New Mexico to Nebraska is expected to threaten the progress that firefighters have made, officials said Thursday.
A swath of the country stretching from Arizona to the Texas panhandle is expected to be hit the hardest by the return of the bad firefighting weather that has generated unusually hot and fast-moving fires for this time of year, forecasters warned.
Red flag warnings ofextreme wildfire dangerhave been issued for some of the same states that experienced blazes that raced across the landscape last week. The warnings were in place for all of New Mexico and parts of Arizona, Nevada, Colorado, Texas, Oklahoma and Nebraska.
In drought-stricken New Mexico, flames jumped a line built to corral the northwestern perimeter of a blaze that already destroyed an undetermined number of homes in several villages while marching across 100 square miles  of meadows and mountainsides.
Some of the nearly 1,000 firefighters in New Mexico battling what has become that largest wildfire burning in the U.S. worked Thursday to prevent it from moving into the rural community of Ledoux. That meant bolstering fire lines and sending in crews tasked with protecting structures, said Jayson Coil, a firefighting operations section chief.
“We recognize that over the next two days we’re going to have very unfavorable conditions with red flag warnings and then high winds — not as high as the big blow-up day last week but maybe 45 to 50 mph — and they’re going to want to push that fire up to the northeast,” he said.
That leads toward Ledoux, where many residents have already fled. Evacuations were kept in place for numerous other nearby communities.
Some light rain added moisture to bone-dry vegetation in the Southwest early this week, but higher winds Wednesday  probably dried out grass and other brush that can help fuel fires.
Authorities in northwestern New Mexico were refining the evacuation strategies that they were forced to quickly put in place last week, said San Miguel County Sheriff Chris Lopez.
“It doesn’t mean it will happen but it could happen, just like we saw when this fire blew up,” he said. “The danger is present and it’s very real.”
Authorities were still tallying how many homes had burned in the New Mexico fire. Some areas were still smoldering and officials reiterated that it was not yet safe enough to allow the return of some people who fled.
The Southwest has born the brunt of large fires. Five wildfire incident management teams have been mobilized to oversee the firefighting efforts, according to the National Interagency Fire Center.
One team was overseeing a large prairie fire in Nebraska, where more than 200 firefighters were battling a blaze that has been burning since last week.
About 68 square miles  of mostly grasses and farmland have been blackened near Nebraska’s state line with Kansas, several homes were destroyed and at least one person was killed. That fire was 88% contained Thursday.
In Arizona, crews were trying to control two major wildfires, with strong winds on Wednesday pushing flames across more of the Prescott National Forest. Near Flagstaff, crews patrolled burned areas of another large fire amid milder weather that helps firefighting efforts.

Today’s Headlines: Plans for a massive new reservoir whip up old controversy,https://www.latimes.com/world-nation/newsletter/2022-05-31/todays-headlines-sites-reservoir-sacramento-valley-todays-headlines,2022-05-31,"By Amy Hubbard
Hello, it’sTuesday, May 31, and here are the stories you shouldn’t miss today:
California’s drought has resurrected a plan for the controversial Sites Reservoir
A long-dead proposal to flood a bucolic valley north of Sacramento and create amassive reservoir for thirsty Southern Californiais finding new life — and opposition — amid the effects of climate change and worsening drought.
The Sites Reservoir was conceived in the 1950s and abandoned in the 1980s, but the megadrought has renewed interest in the plan, much to the dismay of environmentalists. The controversy has transformed the western Sacramento River valley into a battleground.
“Sites Reservoir won’t provide a lot of water,” said one environmentalist. “It will be costly, though, and hard to stop because it enables elected officials to say, ‘Look, we’re doing something about megadrought. It’s become their solution to climate change.”

Street fighting raged in a key east Ukrainian city that lay in ruins
Russian troops pushed farther into Severodonetsk,fighting street by street with Kyiv’s forcesin a battle the mayor said had left the city in ruins and driven tens of thousands of people from their homes. Military analysts painted the fight for the city as part of a race against time for the Kremlin. Severodonetsk is key to Russian efforts to complete the capture of the eastern industrial region of the Donbas quickly — before more Western arms arrive to bolster Ukraine’s defense.
Meanwhile, European Union leaders reached a compromise to impose apartial oil embargo on Russiaat a summit focused on helping Ukraine with a long-delayed package of sanctions that was blocked by Hungary. The watered-down embargo covers only Russian oil brought in by sea, allowing a temporary exemption for imports delivered by pipeline. EU Council President Charles Michel said on Twitter the agreement covered more than two-thirds of oil imports from Russia.
In Texas, the visitations, funerals and burials began
Monday should have been the first day of a joyous week for Robb Elementary School students — the start of summer break. Instead, the first two of 19 children slain inside a Uvalde, Texas, classroom were being remembered at funeral visitations. Over the next 2½ weeks, people in the southwestern Texas townwill say goodbye to the children and their teachers, one heart-wrenching visitation, funeral and burial after another.

What student loan forgiveness would mean to these borrowers
The pandemic repayment pause gave loan holders a glimpse of whatlife could look like if they didn’t have the debt. To learn more about their experiences, The Times interviewed over a dozen borrowers. Several talked about how they approached paying for college and the ways in which they tried to avoid debt. Millennial borrowers said they felt older generations didn’t understand their experience.
Student loan holders also talked about what might come next as President Biden reportedly considers a plan to forgive at least $10,000 in debt for people making under $125,000 a year. One borrower, facing $150,000 in debt, said: “I’m not a supporter of Biden ... Yes, I could possibly benefit from this policy. But do I agree with it? Yes and no.”
The suspense in California’s June 7 primary election is in races far down the ballot
With the lack of suspense in California’s marquee races, the greatest challenge facing voters may be rousing themselves enough to cast ballots to decide othercontests that could sway the balance of powerin Congress and the future of state criminal justice policies. The low-intensity vibe threatens to boil down the June electorate to habitual voters and hard-core partisans, a result traditionally favoring Republicans.
Among the more intriguing twists in statewide races is the emergence of candidates shunning affiliation with any political party, including a top candidate for California attorney general. Sacramento County Dist. Atty. Anne Marie Schubert, a career prosecutor who shed her GOP registration in 2018 and switched to “no party preference,” hopes to finish in the top two in the primary. If successful, Schubert in November would face off against Atty. Gen. Rob Bonta, a Newsom appointee known for his liberal stance on criminal justice.

Eighty-seven years ago this week,the California Pacific International Exposition opened in San Diego’s Balboa Park. As sister paper theSan Diego Union-Tribune reportedin 2021, the 1935-36 expo opened “as a grand carnival on May 29, 1935, and closed on Nov. 11. It reopened the following year on Feb. 12 and ran for another seven months.” The 7.2 million visitors were given a reprieve from the gloom of the Great Depression with attractions that included a “daring Nudist Colony” and Gold Gulch, a simulated Gold Rush town.
As The Times reported in its May 30, 1935, edition on the launch of the event, there was also “Alpha, the ten-foot mechanical man” at the Palace of Science; a 50-foot-long “sculptured replica of the power line from Hoover Dam to Los Angeles”; and at the “House of Magic,” a model kitchen with a sink that had “a hidden electric dishwasher which does about everything but put the dishes back on the shelves.”
The report included a photo of people with their faces pressed to a tall fence: “Hundreds of visitors to the [exposition] rushed to the Zoo Gardens trying to get a view of nudists through holes in the fence.” The report said “about twenty daughters of the sun go about quite scantily clad behind these walls for the purpose of demonstrating the advantages of outdoor life.”

Wildfire burns in Angeles National Forest near Bouquet Reservoir,https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2022-05-30/fire-angeles-national-forest-bouquet-reservoir,2022-05-30,"A wildfire began burning in Angeles National Forest near Lancaster on Monday, growing to 75 acres by late afternoon, fire officials said.
No one had been hurt and no homes were threatened as of 3:18 p.m., according to Los Angeles County Fire Department Supervisor Bernard Peters.
Reports of a blaze first came in about 2 p.m., according to Peters, who said approximately 100 county firefighters were responding to the scene alongside U.S. Forest Service personnel. Crews were also battling the blaze with water drops from helicopters and fixed-wing aircraft, Peters said.
Peters could not immediately comment on the cause of the fire, which he said was burning in the forest near the Bouquet Reservoir, close to Lancaster and Gorman.
Early reports that a vehicle fire had sparked the wildfire were inaccurate, Peters said. The fire had grown to 75 acres by about 3:30 p.m. Monday, according to theTwitter account for the Angeles National Forest.The account described the speed of the fire’s spread as “moderate” and said the blaze was “holding” near a ridge.
News footage from the scene showed thick plumes of white smoke hanging over the area, as aircraft dropped fire retardant onto burning vegetation.

"Inflation might motivate Republicans, but don’t expect it to win them many California elections",https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2022-05-30/skelton-inflation-republicans-california-elections,2022-05-30,"SACRAMENTO —Wallet-eating gasoline. Soaring grocery prices. Unaffordable housing. Tumbling stocks.
In short:inflation, an election-year plague for Democrats.
But is it in California? Republicans haven’t been competitive here for a long while. Democrats might just cruise through this.
Add to that, however, the likelihood of power blackouts, devastating wildfires and choking smoke this summer — again. Plus, water cutbacks because of the drought. Persistent homelessness.
And no baby formula.
We won’t know the full political impact of the economic hardships, natural disasters and lifestyle aggravations until November.
But historically, inflation has hurt the party in power. That’s currently Democrats — in Washington and Sacramento. And this is the worst inflation in 40 years.
For perspective, the last timeinflationwas this bad, in 1980, voters ousted  Democratic President  Carter and installed Republican Ronald Reagan. Republicans captured the U.S. Senate for the first time in 26 years, picking up 12 seats. The GOP gained 34 House seats, but Democrats retained comfortable control.
In California, Republicans picked up six House seats and gained three in the state Assembly.
The playing field is much different this time, however.
Fortunately for President Biden, he isn’t up for reelection. Even in deep-blue California, the Democrat isn’t all that popular: 48% job approval and 49% disapproval among likely voters, according to a poll published last week by the nonpartisan Public Policy Institute of California.
Gov. Gavin Newsomand U.S. Sen. Alex Padilla are on the ballot, but they’re virtual shoo-ins.
The one statewide contest in which inflation and unchecked spending could help a Republican is in the race for controller. Lanhee Chen, a Stanford public policy instructor and former Mitt Romney campaign advisor, has an outside chance of becoming the first Republican to win a statewide office since 2006.
A handful of congressional races also could be swayed by inflation. So could any bond proposals on the ballot.
“Inflation is the one issue that impacts almost everybody,” says Republican consultant Dave Gilliard. “It doesn’t matter whether you’re on minimum wage or one of the wealthiest people in the country.
California
The governor’s proposal spans both long-term investments and immediate cash rebates, largely made possible by a towering $97.5-billion tax surplus through next summer.
“I do think it will be the dominant issue.”
“High inflation always has an impact on elections,” says Democratic strategist Garry South. “But it’s not something politicians can do much about.”
Well, there actually is something they can do: Stop doling out big economic stimulus packages — trillions from the feds and billions from the state. It heats inflation.
“No doubt, pumping that much money into the economy had an inflationary effect,” South says. “But on the other side, do you want the economy to go into a recession? It’s a Hobson’s choice. We’re paying the price.”
He adds that “sending out billions of dollars to help motorists pay for gasoline might even raise gas prices….
“But I think the Supreme Court overturning Roe vs. Wade is going to have a bigger political impact than inflation. It will have a demonstrable effect in California.”
Gilliard says that “November is coming down to Democrats talking about abortion and guns and Republicans talking about inflation and the border.”
But David Townsend, a strategist for moderate Democrats, says that inflation “transcends everything. Roe vs. Wade, Ukraine, Trump craziness — all that takes a back seat when people are worried about money and the cost of things.”
The PPIC poll produced data that should disturb the party in power.
“It’s bad news for the Democrats,” says PPIC president and pollster Mark Baldassare. “Financial worry is a factor that leads people to want change.”
Likely voters were asked what they thought was the most important issue facing California. No. 1, by far, was “jobs, the economy and inflation.” That was the response of 24%.
No. 2 with  13% was “housing costs and availability,” partly a derivative of inflation. Then came homelessness with  11%.
Republicans were more concerned about inflation than Democrats. But it was an even bigger worry among independents — 32% called  it the state’s most important problem.
“Independents are thinking more like Republicans,” says GOP consultant Matt Rexroad.
If so, that could shift election dynamics in California.
Independents in recent years have leaned Democratic in their voting. Officially listed as No Party Preference, their registration numbers are slightly less than those of Republicans, who are outnumbered nearly 2 to 1 by Democrats.
The PPIC poll found independents thinking more like Republicans on things besides inflation. They believe California is moving “in the wrong direction,” And they disapprove of the way both Biden and the state Legislature are handling their jobs.
But a plurality of independents said they intend to vote for a Democratic congressional candidate. Overall, 55% of likely voters said they’ll support a Democrat in House races; only 35% plan to back a Republican.
The poll found, however, that Republicans are more eager to vote than Democrats and independents. Half of GOP voters are “very” or “extremely” enthusiastic about casting ballots in House elections. Only a third of Democrats and independents are.
“Inflation will  affect turnout for Republicans,” Baldassare says. “They’re upset about the economy….
“The biggest thing for me in the poll is that it shows an enthusiasm gap. That’s bad news for Democrats.”
But Republicans can’t win with just enthusiasm. In most communities, they need votes from Democrats and independents. And Californians haven’t been willing to accept the GOP as an alternative to one-party rule.
That’s unlikely to change even with painful inflation, record gas prices and inexcusable homelessness. Republicans still oppose abortion rights and gun control.

Greenville was destroyed by wildfire. Can it be rebuilt to survive the next one?,https://www.latimes.com/environment/story/2022-05-30/greenville-was-destroyed-by-a-wildfire-can-it-be-rebuilt,2022-05-30,"GREENVILLE, Calif.  —To descend the grade of State Highway 89 into the rubble of Greenville is to retrace the steps of a community’s trauma.
It was here that the second largest wildfire in California history — and the first ever to burn from one side of the Sierra Nevada to the other — decimated the town of about 1,000 people.
Hillsides once thick with trees are now blackened and splattered with bright blue-green hydromulch to fight erosion. The town center is a grid of bare lots and debris piles.
But while most people would see devastation here, Sue Weber sees hope and opportunity. A former nun in Mother Teresa’s order, Weber is part of an unprecedented effort to not only rebuild Greenville, but to build it back better than it was before.
It’s an endeavor that involves the Dixie Fire Collaborative, a grass-roots rebuilding coalition Weber co-chairs. It has grown to include members of an Indigenous tribe and loggers backed by an environmental nonprofit who want to convert dead and scorched trees into lumber for new homes and businesses. Above all, they say, they want to ensure a tragedy on this scale will never happen here again.
“There’s the mysteries and the beauties of destruction and creation,” Weber said. “Everything can be destroyed but now we have this capacity to create something so valuable.”
During a recent tour of Greenville’s downtown, Weber pointed to the charred remains that once held pieces of her community: That pile of rubble was the pharmacy. Over there, the post office. This was the old bed and breakfast that Weber once called home.
One thing she is adamant about is that Greenville can’t simply rebuild exactly the way it was. Even before the fire, its population was on the decline, and its poverty rate was more than double that of California as a whole. “You have to have economic development in the game,” she said.
The Dixie Fire Collaborative, which draws about 150 people to its monthly meetings at Greenville Elementary School, has drawn inspiration from other communities that have suffered disaster. Weber and others visited Greensburg, Kan., which was nearly destroyed by a tornado in 2007. Leveled buildings have been replaced with energy-efficient structures that are powered by wind. They’re also looking to Joplin, Mo., which is increasing its population a little over a decade after it too was devastated by a tornado.
“They said the biggest piece is pretty much what we recognize. Most people want to go fast,” Weber said, snapping her fingers. “Just to rebuild back as opposed to really stopping and really intentionally looking at what’s the best way to build back that’s healthy and helpful for everybody.”
For that reason, the Dixie Fire Collaborative has embarked on a multi-stage process to gather community input and create an architectural plan for the downtown.
The collaborative is working to attract broadband service to lure young professionals and remote workers. It is coordinating a popup that will see food trucks and a mobile saloon set up shop downtown, a first step toward drawing people back to the area to spend money at local establishments. And it’s exploring cost-effective, fire-hardened housing alternatives like those made of insulated concrete or cross-laminated timber, or built with 3-D printers or assembly line production.
For the Mountain Maidu people, it was exceptionally painful to watch the fire take out the heart of their ancestral territory.
If they’d still been stewards of the land, they say, the fire would never have burned as severely as it did.
For centuries, the Maidu cultural hub of Kótasi, meaning “on the snowline,” thrived in the area that is now Greenville, said Trina Cunningham, executive director of the Maidu Summit Consortium, a nonprofit dedicated to reacquiring and protecting ancestral lands.
The Maidu regularly burned vegetation in the surrounding hills for scores of purposes: to stimulate the production of seeds, to control pest populations and to keep the land open so they could better spot intruders and game. The fires also helped the Maidu obtain basket making materials, tools and medicine.
“They knew when to burn and where to burn and how to burn,” said Allen Lowry, vice chair of the Maidu Summit Consortium.
The land became adapted to these regular, low-intensity fires set under ideal conditions, but in the mid-1800s, that balance was upended.
“During the Gold Rush, everything changed very quickly,” Cunningham said. “It was a horrible history of our families in this place.”
Settlers slaughtered the Maidu, exposed them to diseases, took their land and forced their children into boarding schools that stripped them of their culture. They logged the hills surrounding the village, removing the largest, most fire-resilient trees, and they clear-cut swaths of forest, replacing the diverse flora with tightly-packed, single-species plantations that “burn like gas,” Lowry said. They also suppressed both cultural burns and nature-sparked  fires.
During the Dixie fire, winds funneled flames down the hills toward Greenville. The combination of dry brush and dense timber whipped the conflagration into a high-severity crown fire, in which flames run across the treetops, gaining speed and spitting out embers.
Firefighters trying to defend Greenville were overwhelmed by myriad spot fires. The flames burned so hot, many of the street lamps melted. The Greenville Rancheria’s offices and health facilities were destroyed.
“We would never have let it get to this state,” Cunningham said. “And to have to watch it when we knew that it could have been prevented is just horrific. It’s like another form of torture.”
The Maidu had just two years before claimed a significant victory when Pacific Gas & Electric Company returned 2,325 acres of ancestral meadow land called Tásmam Kojóm. They had been working to reintroduce cultural burning to reduce the effects of future catastrophic blazes when the Dixie fire ripped through, upending their plans and leaving them grappling with what to do next.
In a development Lowry called “almost ironic,” state investigators have since found that PG&E’s equipment sparked the Dixie fire, and the utility has said it may also have been responsible for starting another fire that merged with the Dixie.
Lowry estimates that in the past two decades, about 90% of the Maidu’s ancestral land has burned in repeated fires. “We read that the climate is changing, and we can see it, we can feel it,” he said. “And fires like this are just going to be the way it’s going to be.”
Today, as Greenville rebuilds, Cunningham sees an opportunity for the Maidu to cast aside the feeling that they are refugees in their own homeland. It’s possible now for the town to embrace the Maidu’s culture, creating what she calls an immersion experience. The larger community has been receptive, she said.
Possibilities include a park with interpretative panels in Maidu, street signs in Maidu or buildings decorated with cultural designs, Cunningham said. She would also like to see a Maidu Institute of Ecology built in Plumas County, with different learning campuses where Maidu people can pass on knowledge about their concepts of existence and relationship with nature.
“We are in those discussions of rebuilding,” Cunningham said, “to make sure that the Mountain Maidu aren’t erased again from one of the communities that are so important to us.”
Nearly a year after fire swept over Greenville, the only activity on the streets of downtown are workers hauling concrete and cutting down the tens of thousands of burned trees that must be removed from roadsides to mitigate hazards or cleared from lots so people can rebuild.
Randy Pew, a third-generation logger born in Greenville who now lives in nearby Crescent Mills, describes the trees as “incredibly valuable, but not worth a dime.”
They are valuable because they can be milled into timber and used to provide  residents with lower-cost building material, he said. But they’re also worthless because there is nowhere to take them to be milled. Existing mills are backlogged processing trees salvaged from their own burned landholdings.
Pew, who runs J&C Enterprises with his son Jared, hopes to change that. He has partnered with the nonprofit Sierra Institute for Community and Environment to build a sawmill in Crescent Mills, using a grant from the Sierra Nevada Conservancy. They cut their first board in December and  hosted a ribbon-cutting ceremony May 18.
“We’re going to call it Dixie pine,” Pew said as he showed off the mill’s uniquely designed equipment, including greenhouses engineered to be used as solar dry kilns and gearhead motors he found on Craigslist and sent two men to Canada to purchase at an enormous cost saving.
It’s the kind of creative partnership that representatives of the state and nonprofit say is sorely needed to both invigorate local economies and support sustained, landscape-scale forest restoration activities. It’s also ripe for replication across the Sierra Nevada, which has many shuttered sawmills and an abundance of burned trees, they said.
Jonathan Kusel, founder and executive director of the Sierra Institute, recalls driving past burned stumps and wondering what had happened to the rest of the tree. In many cases, he learned, agencies like the California Department of Transportation were paying contractors large sums  to grind the trees up into wood chips by the side of the road.
“How can we do something to add value, or utilize the value that’s in that log?” Kusel wondered. “So that was the birth of the idea.”
A rural sociologist, Kusel has devoted his life’s work to restoring and preserving both ecosystems and economies, which he sees as inseparably linked. It’s not lost on him that a partnership with a for-profit logging firm might raise eyebrows. But to him, people are a part of these landscapes, the same as trees, birds and bears. He believes it’s possible to meet their needs for both wood products and jobs in a sustainable way.
“We have lumped all loggers and mill operators into this bad category,” Kusel said. “But you hear Randy talking and you do hear that concern for the system. And what it also entails is a concern for the social system.”
Right now, J&C is sourcing logs from lots that homeowners’ insurance companies have paid them to clear, as well as from CalTrans. Before the agency agreed to provide the logs, Pew estimates that 15 houses’ worth of wood was being chipped each day.
“It’s really heartbreaking to drive by these massive trees and watch them busting them up with an excavator and ram them through a chipper,” said lumber mill employee Dan Kearns, a volunteer firefighter whose Facebook broadcasts made him a local folk  hero during the Dixie fire.
But Kearns said the heartbreak turns to fury “when you get told it’s going to be $400 a square foot to rebuild your house.”
The operators hope to eventually transition from processing salvage logs to milling trees removed from forests during thinning projects intended to restore the landscape to more fire-resilient precolonial conditions. They say it’s a strategic way to supplement grant and government funding to help ensure the work continues and that the local community benefits.
“When people are thinning the forest, it’s so hard for the material to pay its way out of the woods,” said Georgia Reid, a wood utilization project specialist with the Sierra Institute. “A lot of times the treatment can’t even happen because there’s no disposal pathway.”
At a mid-March meeting of the Dixie Fire Collaborative, emceed by Weber and attended by Randy Pew, whose other son Tyler is helping lead the committee’s rebuild team, community members continued to feel their way back from the brink.
Over bratwursts provided by Mary’s German Grill, people shared news of progress on a new gas station and a popular jerky manufacturer that had laid a foundation in its reconstruction effort. There were updates on debris removal and soil sampling and questions about solar panels and fire sprinkler permits.
Then Reid announced the mill would soon formally open. The sedate crowd erupted in claps and whistles.
“It’s really helping rebuild hope,” Kusel said later. “We can recover.”

Who cashes in after a California wildfire?,https://www.latimes.com/opinion/story/2022-05-30/wildfire-disaster-cleanup-contracts-revenue,2022-05-30,"Driving around parts of southern El Dorado County, you can’t miss the trucks. Everywhere near the areas ravaged by the 2021 Caldor fire thatleveled the community of Grizzly Flats,you see semis hauling trees and Ford F-150s with their company logos.
Residents could understandably wonder: Who is paying for all this work? And who is profiting from it?
It’s mostly the federal government and insurance companies writing the checks, meaning taxpayers and insurance customers are footing the bill. The Federal Emergency Management Agency has provided access to more than $78 million in grants for emergency and permanent work, which includes debris and hazardous tree removal, emergency protective measures and restoring public infrastructure in the fire-ravaged areas.
To get government crews to clear ash, debris and hazardous trees off their land, property owners are required to sign a right-of-entry form that requests insured residents file a claim and agree that any proceeds of those claims go directly to the government, and in some cases the proceeds from debris removal may go to the private companies doing the work.
Theeconomic costsof a disaster to state and local governments are much discussed, but less explored are the economic benefits to governments and contractors. There’s a line in the black comedy “Don’t Look Up” that seems applicable. A comet is heading toward Earth, and an astronomer has been trying to warn everyone that it has to be destroyed to save life on the planet. Still, her parents tell her: “We’re in favor of the jobs the comet will create.” The joke is a poke at business as usual, but in fact, climate-related disasters do create jobs.
Take logging, for example. Logging in federal and state parks is prohibited, and it is cost-prohibitive on residential property. Taking a single tree down can cost thousands of dollars. When a wildfire sweeps through an area, however, the burned trees that remain present many hazards, such as risk of falling on power poles or structures after the tree dies or the risk of adding fuel to another fire. As part of the debris removal process, these hazardous trees are removed.
But determining which trees pose a hazard is entirely at the discretion of the government. Property owners waive all rights and claims to trees on their property by signing the form. This includes, as the form states, “non-fire damaged trees.” Trees, whether healthy or dead, are loaded onto trucks and transported to mills. This is referred to as “salvage logging” and is acontroversial practice.
On federal land, the money made from timber sales goes back to the U.S. Forest Service. Between October 2021 and March 2022, thecut value of convertible timberharvested from the El Dorado National Forest, which sits within the Caldor fire burn area, was $459,336. But on state and private land, companies bidding for cleanup contracts can reduce bids by factoring in profit they anticipate from timber sales as a result of the cleanup. That ultimately means the government spends less, and contractors have a chance to make a profit.
All this work, from the clear-cutting to the milling, creates jobs. For every 1,000 fires, around 527 logging jobs are created, and over the last five years, there has been an average of a little more than 8,000 fires per year in California. These are not high-paying jobs, though. According to theBureau of Labor Statistics, the national median wage for a logging worker is $22.16 an hour. Workers on the ground in non-supervisory roles are more likely to be making $13.59 an hour.
Logging isn’t the only sector to see an increase in jobs during disaster recovery. A New Yorkerarticlefrom 2021 detailed the lives of migrant workers laboring in cleanup and reconstruction. They are typically underpaid, if they are paid at all. The firms that hire the workers, on the other hand, have won huge state contracts.
The reality is that with fire season starting earlier every year, California is going to experience more disasters at the level of Caldor or the Camp fire. Survivors and workers need more protections during the recovery process. For residents, that means more communication from state and local governments about the cleanup process and also more control over timber recovered during the cleanup process. For some, revenue from salvaged lumber would provide resources to rebuild.
There is no denying that climate change is going to create more jobs in the disaster-recovery industry. But whether those are jobs with strong worker protections and fair pay depends on government reassessing its role in dealing with this consequence of a hotter planet.

"A historic California redwood park will soon welcome visitors, two years after devastating fire",https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2022-05-28/a-historic-california-redwood-park-will-soon-welcome-visitors-two-years-after-devastating-fire,2022-05-28,"Nearly two years after a massive wildfire tore through Big Basin Redwoods State Park in the Santa Cruz Mountains, parts of the park are set to reopen this summer, allowing visitors the opportunity to return to its ancient coast redwood forests.
About 97% of California’s oldest state park was burned in August 2020 when the CZU Lightning Complex fire tore through Santa Cruz and San Mateo counties.
Climate & Environment
Two months after fires burned through Big Basin Redwoods State Park, some scientists are wondering whether the park will ever truly come back.
The fire burned for more than a month, covering 86,000 acres and killing one person. It also damaged or destroyed nearly all of the park’s buildings, campgrounds and trail networks and burned nearly all its old-growth redwood forest. But those forests are recovering.
“Almost every large old growth redwood tree is showing regrowth, with green needles sprouting from blackened trunks and branches,” officials said in anews release.
The return of full access to the park is expected to take several years. But Santa Cruz District Superintendent Chris Spohrer said the park will be open for limited days this summer, starting after the Fourth of July.
The exact reopening date will be made public in June along with a link to the park’s new online reservation system, Spohrer said. Reservations will be required for all parking.
Visitors will also be able to take a Metro bus from Santa Cruz on the weekends, which will not require a reservation.
About 18 miles of fire roads will open to the public for hiking and biking, along with two loop trails that will be accessible from the park’s headquarters area.
Travel & Experiences
It’s the perfect time to visit America’s most treasured landscapes.
The news of the reopening comes as state parks officials announced the release of theReimagining Big Basin Vision Summary, which outlines plans to rebuild the 18,000-acre park with an eye toward prioritizing the health of the forest while allowing visitors continued access.
“While the CZU Lightning Complex fire’s impacts to the park were tragic, the forest is incredibly resilient and regrowing,” California State Parks Director Armando Quintero said in a statement. “This is our time, as stewards of Big Basin Redwoods State Park, to increase the resiliency of the forest and equity of access to all Californians, and honor the deep history that makes this park so iconic.”

Passenger who attacked flight attendant on San Diego-bound plane gets prison,https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2022-05-28/flight-attendant-attack-sentence,2022-05-28,"SAN DIEGO —A passenger who attacked a flight attendant on a San Diego-bound plane last year, leaving the victim with broken teeth, was sentenced in San Diego federal court Friday to 15 months in federal custody.
The sentence that Vyvianna Quinonez, 29, received from U.S. District Judge Todd Robinson is more than what prosecutors had sought, which was four months in custody and six months of house arrest.
Robinson also ordered the Sacramento resident to pay a $7,500 fine — prosecutors had asked for a fine of $5,000 — and ordered her to spend three years on supervised release. During that time, Quinonez must attend anger management classes, and she is not allowed to fly on commercial aircraft.
Abystander recorded the attackon the plane just before it landed in San Diego on May 23, 2021, and the 44-second video quickly went viral. The attack also served as a high-profile example of what the Federal Aviation Administration said was the rapid rise of “unruly” passenger behavior last year.
Quinonezpleaded guiltyto interfering with the duties of a flight attendant and agreed to pay nearly $26,000 in restitution.
Assistant U.S. Attorney Jaclyn Stahl called Quinonez’s behavior “unconscionable” and said Friday’s sentence was “justice for the victims,” including the airline and the several dozen passengers on board.
“Today’s sentence should send a clear message that interference with flight crew members and violence aboard aircraft… will not be tolerated, and there will be grave consequences for doing so,” Stahl said.
The attack followed the flight attendant’s request that Quinonez fasten her seatbelt, stow her tray table and pull up her face mask as Southwest Airlines Flight 700 out of Sacramento neared its San Diego destination.
Quinonez instead shouted profanities and took swings at the airline staffer. Other passengers jumped in to stop the attack, and one wedged himself between Quinonez and the flight attendant.
The victim sustained broken teeth and a cut that left a scar under her eye. Stahl said the flight attendant was off work for several months after the incident.
In a motion asking Robinson to sentence Quinonez to house arrest, defense attorney Knut Johnson said Quinonez “is a good person who made a really big mistake in the heat of the moment, and who immediately regretted her mistake.”
Her attorney also noted that the FAA is seeking as much as $24,000 from Quinonez. And, he wrote, “the collateral consequences to Ms. Quinonez have been severe,” including internet infamy.
“In fact, a simple Google search for her name shows over 3,000 results, none positive,” Johnson wrote. “YouTube, Facebook, Instagram, and other social media sites have almost endless discussions of her offense. Because of that publicity, she can never put this case fully behind her.”
Quinonez was free on bond following her December guilty plea but went back into custody after she was arrested on suspicion of drunken driving in January.
The FAA says investigations intounruly passenger behavior spikedin 2021. In the decade prior, the agency investigated roughly 100 to 200 cases a year. Last year, it launched just shy of 1,100 investigations.
Aside from launching formal investigations, the agency grappled with thousands of complaints of bad behavior last year — much of which involved plane passengers refusing to follow federal mask mandates.
The numbers remain high during the first five months of this year, at least 470 such investigations.
Last year, the FAA proposed $5 million in fines against unruly passengers.

"Police delays may have deprived Texas schoolchildren of lifesaving care, experts say",https://www.latimes.com/world-nation/story/2022-05-27/police-delays-may-have-deprived-texas-schoolchildren-of-lifesaving-care-experts-say,2022-05-28,"UVALDE, Texas —As the nation struggles to comprehend thehorrors that unfoldedTuesday inside Robb Elementary School in Uvalde, Texas, one of the biggest unanswered questions is whether anyone could have been saved.
Authorities have left the public with more questions than answers about the mass shooting that left 21 dead, and their timeline hasshifted multiple times. At least 17 children were hospitalized with injuries, though it’s unclear how many of those survived.
Thelatest updateprovided Friday by the Texas Department of Public Safety found that more than an hour elapsed between the time the shooter entered the school at 11:33 a.m. and the time law enforcement officers breached a locked classroom and killed him at 12:50 p.m.
World & Nation
Investigators are interviewing witnesses and analyzing video to explain the delayed police response to the massacre that killed 21 at a Texas school.
World & Nation
Police in Texas admit mistakes in the handling of a gunman who killed 21 people, including 19 children, at Robb Elementary School.
According to the timeline provided by authorities,  a person called 911 from inside Room 112, one of the classrooms where the shooting occurred, at 12:16 p.m. and said there were “eight to nine students alive.”
Though it is not yet known whether those students were ultimately among the victims, the injured or thesurvivors, police and medical experts said that in most instances, the sooner a patient can get some form of medical attention, the better the chances at pulling through.

World & Nation
New photos from the shooting at Robb Elementary School in Uvalde, Texas
According to Dr. Demetrios Demetriades, a professor of surgery and director of trauma at Los Angeles County-USC Medical Center, the mortality rate of a patient increases by about 10% for every 10 minutes of delayed bleeding control.
L.A. County-USC’s chief of trauma, Dr. Kenji Inaba, said similarly that “bleeding remains the No. 1 preventable cause of death after ballistic injury,” though he said he could not comment on the law enforcement tactics used in Uvalde or the medical care provided at the scene.
“After sustaining a ballistic injury, every second counts, and as soon as it is feasible to do so, victims should be triaged, have any obvious bleeding stopped, and then be transported to the nearest trauma center for definitive care,” he said.
World & Nation
The names and stories of those killed in the Texas school shooting are emerging as the stunned community of Uvalde tries to cope with Tuesday’s attack.
World & Nation
Uvalde survivors’ stories: One fourth-grader said the shooter came into his classroom and said, ‘It’s time to die.’
Dr. Marc Eckstein, professor of emergency medicine and chief of the EMS Division at USC, said, “The longer it takes to evacuate patients from the hot zone, the worse their outcome is going to be.”
“When you have a place like [Uvalde] where your nearest Level 1 trauma center, San Antonio, is 80 miles away, the responsibility of law enforcement is to simultaneously try to neutralize the shooter and evacuate the workers and the kids and teachers as quickly as possible,” Eckstein said. “That was a lesson learned in Columbine, and a lesson that wasn’t learned in the Pulse nightclub shooting [in Orlando, Fla.], where patients who were potentially viable bled to death.”
Still, Eckstein said, he didn’t want to give grieving families the sense that their loved ones might have survived had authorities responded differently, particularly since so much depends on the location and type of injury.
The AR-15-type of rifle used in the shooting causes “devastating injuries to the body,” Eckstein said, not because of the size of the rounds but because their high velocity generates immense kinetic energy.
“And then on top of that, you have children,” he said. “The fatality rate of a child getting hit by a round like this is going to be much higher than an adult, and it’s going to be higher than a typical round from a handgun.”

The gunman who killed 19 children and two teachers at a Texas elementary school barricaded himself inside a fourth-grade classroom, officials say.
The mother of 8-year-old survivor Adam Pennington said Friday she was troubled by the new timeline released by law enforcement.
“When you’re on scene, you should listen to your gut,” said Laura Pennington, 33. “I think everybody was very afraid and confused, and that causes problems. But there should be a set protocol for all of these situations.”
Pennington, who is also a substitute teacher in the district, said her brother-in-law was among those who rushed to the school to help but were kept outside by law enforcement even as officers refused to enter.
“I understand that they’re afraid for their own lives, but these guys are in tactical gear. They could have swarmed the building from all angles,” she said. “He was terrorizing these children. They needed to do more.”

The Supreme Court just made it harder to save the planet,https://www.latimes.com/opinion/story/2022-06-30/editorial-the-supreme-court-just-made-it-harder-to-save-the-planet,2022-06-30,"At a moment when the world should be racing to prevent the worst effects of global warming, the Supreme Court just made itharder for the U.S.to cut carbon emissions from power plants quickly and cost-effectively.
In yet another ruling this session that upended norms, the court said in its6-3 decisionThursday that the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency overstepped its authority in trying to develop sweeping regulations to reduce climate-warming pollutants.
To be clear, the ruling didn’t remove the EPA’s authority to cut carbon emissions from individual power plants, which are responsible for about aquarter of the nation’s greenhouse gas emissions. The agency still can — and should — require that power plants install equipment that can ratchet down pollution. But the decision limits the EPA’s ability to enact more far-reaching and creative regulatory programs affecting the power sector, such as a nationwide carbon cap-and-trade system similar to California’s that some power industry and business groups have supported as more flexible compliance models.
A landmark U.N. climate report this week broke new ground by finally highlighting the role of misinformation in obstructing action, singling out the United States as hotspot.
With the stakes so high, it’s devastating that the EPA will lose valuable regulatory tools to help slow climate change. The ruling also foreshadows more fights and lawsuits from industry groups attempting to prevent federal agencies from enacting big, important regulations to address evolving problems. The U.S. has a long history of empowering agencies to develop regulations for cleaner air and water, safer workplaces and consumer protections from dangerous products, and the ruling could encourage more challenges to regulatory agencies’ authority.
The majority opinion, written by Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr., said Congress didn’t give the EPA the power to develop regulations that could shift the power sector from fossil fuels to renewable energy. Such major decisions and transformational programs should come with clear direction from Congress, he argued.
But in a dissent signed by the court’s three liberal judges, Justice Elena Kaganwrotethat the majority was ignoring Congress’ intent when lawmakers passed the Clean Air Act in the 1970s — which was to empower the experts to come up with regulatory systems that can evolve over time to reduce emissions in the most cost-efficient, protective way possible. Instead, she argued, the court blocked regulators from carrying out their mandate.
California’s plan to reach net-zero emissions by 2045 shows little ambition for accelerating climate action and must be strengthened to cut more pollution faster.
“Whatever else this Court may know about, it does not have a clue about how to address climate change,” Kagan wrote. “And let’s say the obvious: The stakes here are high. Yet the Court today prevents congressionally authorized agency action to curb power plants’ carbon dioxide emissions. The Court appoints itself — instead of Congress or the expert agency — the decisionmaker on climate policy. I cannot think of many things more frightening.”
She’s right. The stakes are terrifyingly high.
The burning of fossil fuels and other human activity have already warmed Earth by about 2 degrees Fahrenheit compared with preindustrial levels,a United Nations reportwarned earlier this year. Climate change has worsened wildfires, droughts, air pollution and heat waves; caused species to go extinct and trees to die en masse; swallowed up coastal habitat; reduced crop yields; increased hunger and shrunk glaciers and other crucial water supplies.
The world can still avert the worst consequences of the overheating of our planet — mass extinction and catastrophically severe droughts, floods, heat waves and sea level rise — if emissions are cut in half by 2030. But the United States, the world’s biggest polluter historically, has moved far too slowly to end the nation’s reliance on fossil fuels and transition to clean, renewable energy.
The Supreme Court ruling only makes the work harder. The Biden administration is currently developing a rule to cut carbon from power plants. Thursday’s court decision puts new constraints on possible regulatory models, even ones that might be faster or cheaper than ordering power plants to install pollution-control technology. Still, Biden’s EPA should pursue the most aggressive standards; there’s simply no more time to waste.
The decision also puts the onus on Congress. Sure, Congress could pass a law clearly giving the EPA the authority to pass sweeping regulations to cut carbon. But for decades, Republican and some Democratic lawmakers have refused to act on climate change, punting the responsibility to the executive branch and the EPA. It’s time for Congress to finally buck fossil fuel interests and pass a comprehensive bill to accelerate the shift from coal and gas to clean electricity and clean vehicles.
And Congress should make it abundantly clear that the EPA is empowered to adopt the regulations needed to slash greenhouse gases across industries and slow global warming.

13 firefighters injured battling Northern California wildfire; some evacuations lifted,https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2022-06-30/rices-fire-swells-past-900-acres-injures-5-firefighters,2022-07-01,"Some evacuated residents began to return home as firefighters worked Thursday night to contain a wildfire burning in Northern California’s remote Nevada County.
The Rices fire, burning in rugged terrain, was holding at 904 acres and containment had increased to 20%, said Jim Hudson, deputy chief  of the state Department of Forestry and Fire Protection’s Nevada-Yuba-Placer Unit.
Crews noted “very little fire growth” but continued to face challenges on the blaze’s west side, along the Yuba River, Hudson said.
Several hot spots remained, and firefighters were still working to complete containment lines.
Authorities said 13 firefighters have been injured battling the blaze, whichsparked Tuesday. The injuries were primarily heat-related as temperatures near the fire soared into the 80s and 90s this week.
One civilian was also injured, officials said. Information on the nature of that injury was not provided.
Evacuation orders in two zones were downgraded to warnings by Thursday night, allowing about 250 residents to return home, said Nevada County Sheriff’s Capt. Sam Brown.
Residents can check evacuations atcommunity.zonehaven.com.
Brown urged residents to be alert.
“The fire is not out,” he said. “Our fire partners are assuring us that they’re monitoring and ensuring that things are going the best that they can, but we can’t control Mother Nature.”
Roadblocks remain in place on Pleasant Valley Road, Brown said. Only residents and first responders will be allowed through.
Drivers should also be aware of posted signs marking areas that are not yet safe to enter, Brown said.
“We want to get people in their homes, but we also want people to be safe, and we can never guarantee that the fire won’t take a turn,” he said.
Crews were contending with dangerously steep terrain and drought-dried brush that can easily act as fuel for flames, said Mary Eldridge, a Cal Fire spokeswoman.
“It’s just incredibly difficult to access, and so they’re talking about doing rope systems to even get down there,” Eldridge said, adding that there are large rock outcroppings “where it can go from a 20- or 30-foot drop to a 150-foot drop, so it’s hard for firefighters to really get in there with any kind of tools.”
Crews saw “moderate relief” Thursday from extreme temperatures, but conditions were still very hot and dry, officials said.
Wind gusts of up to 14 mph “represent a significant potential for fire spread in the next 24 hours,” Cal Fire said Thursday night.
Four structures have been destroyed by the fire and hundreds more are threatened, Eldridge said.
The fire so far is holding at the Yuba River,  a border between Nevada and Yuba counties, she said. But it is the biggest fire this year in the five-county area of Nevada, Yuba, Placer, Sutter and Sierra.
“It burned quite quickly due to the amount of fuels that were in that canyon, and it doesn’t have a lot of fire history on it,” Eldridge said. “Between the brush and the heavy timber, there was a lot of fuel to burn, so once it got started — and because of the steepness of the canyon — it was really able to make that first run.”
California
The Rices fire, which broke out Tuesday in Nevada County, has burned 769 acres, growing by almost 200 acres overnight, and is still 0% contained.
Some of the initial smoke from the fire has dissipated, said Sierra Littlefield, a National Weather Service meteorologist in Sacramento. However, the Northern Sierra Air Quality Management District has issued anair quality health advisorythat will remain in effect through Tuesday.
Science & Medicine
In California, wildfires caused by humans grow faster and become hotter than wildfires sparked by lightning, the studies show.
Residents who smell or see smoke are advised to stay indoors with doors and windows closed as much as possible.
Eldridge, of Cal Fire, said shifting winds could help the blaze burn back onto itself.
“That’s actually a best-case scenario,” she said. “But you just never know, with the wind on it, if it might pop something up.”
Around 1,000 personnel are battling  the fire from the air and ground, she said, adding that aerial crews on Wednesday dropped 83,000 gallons of retardant onto the flames.
The big concern now is keeping the structures that overlook the river safe as it creeps to the  northwest, she said.
“You can imagine the beautiful views these folks have sitting on the top of the ridge looking down at the river — it’s lovely,” Eldridge said. “It’s just that now it’s covered in smoke.”

Families still shattered a year after LAPD fireworks explosion
One year ago, the Los Angeles Police Department bomb squadbotched the detonation of a fireworks cachediscovered in South Los Angeles. The resulting blast injured 17 people and badly damaged many homes. More than 80 residents were displaced.
Displaced residents moved to the luxury Level Hotel downtown — where the city rented out rooms on the taxpayers’ dime. These were only meant to be a stopgap. But for many, that hasn’t been the case.
Today, 18 familiesstill reside at the Level, according to city officials. As of April, the city’s hotel bill ran to $1.4 million. More recent invoices for the rooms have yet to be tabulated.

Extreme heat and drought will permanently scar California
Unprecedented dryness is meeting with increasingly warm temperatures tocreate climate conditions so extremethat the landscape of California could permanently and profoundly change.
Some say what’s in store for the state could be akin to the conditions that drove people thousands of years ago to abandon cities in the Southwest.
But California’s current transformation is being accelerated by carbon emissions and human-caused climate change, which is creating not only longer and more severe droughts but also hotter ones. It’sa process known as aridification, and many say it’s here to stay.
The campaign to discredit Cassidy Hutchinson has begun
In the hours after Cassidy Hutchinson delivered bombshell testimony to the Jan. 6 committee, former President Trump andhis allies rushed to attackthe former White House staffer.
Hutchinson told the panel that Trump was aware that some of his supporters were armed when he urged them to march to the Capitol. She also testified that Anthony Ornato, then the deputy White House chief of staff, told her the president was so “irate” that the Secret Service would not drive him to the Capitol that he reached for the steering wheel and lunged at an agent.
Trump and his allieshave seized on media reportsof pushback from unnamed Secret Service sources to paint Hutchinson’s sworn testimony as unreliable.

Will everyone in California eventually get coronavirus?
With tens of thousands of new coronavirus cases being reported in California each week, it might seem inevitable that everyone will get infected at some point.
But that’snot necessarily the case, officials and experts say. Even with the near-constant drumbeat of transmission this spring and summer, millions of Californians have still been able to avoid catching the virus.
For some, that might be a matter of circumstance. Others may still be avoiding nonessential activities to lessen their exposure risk. Many mightchalk it up to luck.

California passes polarizing energy bill that could help rescue gas plants,https://www.latimes.com/environment/newsletter/2022-06-30/california-passes-polarizing-energy-bill-that-could-help-rescue-gas-plants-boiling-point,2022-06-30,"This is the June 30, 2022, edition of Boiling Point, a weekly newsletter about climate change and the environment in California and the American West.Sign up hereto get it in your inbox.
California lawmakers passed a sweeping, polarizing energy bill last night, making it easier for state officials to buy electricity from beachfront gas plants and diesel generators, and to approve solar and wind farms over the objections of local governments.
That’s a mouthful, so let’s back up a minute.
The Golden State has an energy crisis — not like the sudden, acute crisis two decades ago, when market manipulation prompted massive blackouts, but rather a slower, longer-lasting crisis in which California has had more and more trouble keeping the lights on.It’s a crisis made worse by climate change — hotter heat waves, higher electricity demand, hydropower dams hammered by drought — and also by California’s response to climate change, which involves shutting down fossil fuel plants and replacing them with solar and wind farms, which aren’t quite as good at supplying electricity right when it’s most needed.
Making matters worse, in the view of many energy experts, is the Public Utilities Commission — the state agency responsible for approving power purchases by monopoly utility companies such as Southern California Edison and Pacific Gas & Electric.
The commission has been scrambling lately to order those companies to secure supplies that can keep the lights on during hot summer nights, when solar farms stop generating. But for years, critics say, the agency was asleep at the wheel, fretting about saddling utility ratepayers with unnecessary costs even as it became clear that a power supply crunch loomed — a crunch that would only get worse with the planned closure of several gas-fired power plants and the Diablo Canyon nuclear reactors.
Well, ratepayers might have been spared for a while — but now the bill has come due.
The legislation approved last night by state lawmakers — in a 27-8 vote by the Senate and a 57-13 vote by the Assembly — will direct billions of dollars toward emergency power supplies, some clean and some dirty, over the next few years, assuming Newsom signs it. (He will, possibly as soon as today.) The bill loosens California’s strict environmental protections to get that done.
For more details, readthe story I wrote ahead of the vote. And please considersubscribing to The Timesto support my reporting.
For the purposes of this newsletter, a few additional observations.
Watching last night’s debate in the Legislature, it quickly became clear that Newsom’s office had persuaded key environment-focused lawmakers to support his proposal — over thefierce oppositionof climate activists, who see it as a fossil fuel boondoggle.
State Sen. Henry Stern (D-Los Angeles) — an ardent environmentalist who hasfought to closethe Aliso Canyon gas storage field — acknowledged the bill will allow state officials to buy “some emergency fossil fuel resources.” But the Newsom administration, he said, has insisted those resources will only be used to keep the lights on as a last resort — and he trusts that will be the case.
Stern also said the governor’s office convinced him the bill won’t allow four Southern California gas plants to stay open after 2023, at least not without additional action by state regulators — a point disputed by climate activists, who read the bill differently.
“Let’s be clear again: This bill does not extend the life of the dirtiest [gas] plants and of Diablo Canyon,” Stern said on the Senate floor. “Those are tough decisions we’re going to have to wrestle with. But we’re not doing that tonight.”
Speaking of Diablo Canyon, the billsets aside $75 millionto help keep the nuclear plant open past 2025, per Nadia Lopez at CalMatters, although it’s far from clear whether that will happen. Diablo Canyon operator PG&E faces a July 5 deadline to apply for much larger amounts of federal funding to help keep the plant open, and the companyrecently askedfor a 75-day extension.
Anyway, back to Stern. As far as he’s concerned, passing the bill — fossil fuels and all — was better than doing nothing.
“We’re trying to get ahead of a crisis,” he said. “If we don’t manage this crisis, utilities around the state of California will do whatever they have to do. And in the past, that has meant firing up dirty [gas] plants in disadvantaged communities.”
Still, Stern said he struggled with how to vote, as did other climate-friendly lawmakers. State Sen. Dave Min (D-Irvine), who haspushed to endoffshore oil drilling, said the bill “does not appear to emphasize green energy.” But he still voted for it, saying the Newsom administration had worked hard to assure lawmakers it wouldn’t lock in long-term reliance on fossil fuels. State Sen. Nancy Skinner (D-Berkeley) urged her colleagues to vote for the bill even as she said it includes “things to love and not to love.”
It was a similar story in the other chamber, where Assemblymember Bill Quirk (D-Union City) voted “aye” after saying, “It’s a lousy bill, but it’s the best hope we have for keeping the lights on.” Assemblymember Phil Ting (D-San Francisco) said the legislation “could go further” to prioritize clean energy, calling it “the beginning of a discussion” that will continue later this summer.
How did the Newsom administration persuade all these skeptical Democrats to sign off on its controversial plan?Several lawmakers said the governor’s office agreed to clarify the bill’s intent to prioritize clean energy, but only after its passage — either through a letter from legislators, a signing statement from Newsom, or — if needed — “cleanup” legislation at a later date.
As far as Kim Delfino is concerned, cleanup legislation is badly needed. She’s an environmental consultant who helped organize opposition to the bill among climate groups, and when I texted her about the idea of a “clarifying letter,” she was skeptical.
“A clarifying letter doesn’t have the force of the law,” she told me.
Also skeptical: State Sen. Ben Allen (D-Santa Monica), whose district includes Redondo Beach Generating Station, one of the four beachfront gas plants that were originally supposed to shut down in 2020, and are currently slated for closure in 2023.
Allen ended up voting for Newsom’s proposal, but only after excoriating state officials for promising to close the plant “over and over again,” only to keep extending the deadline. He called the facility “a total eyesore” that is “incredibly unreliable” — a reference to the fact that Redondo and other aging gas plants have at timesbroken downduring heat waves, when they’re needed most.
“They’re starting to use it to film Cold War-era movies because the equipment is so wonderfully evocative of 1950,” Allen said.
State Assemblymember Al Muratsuchi (D-Torrance), whose district also includes the Redondo Beach plant, was even more critical, calling Newsom’s proposal “a crappy trailer bill that was dumped on us on late Sunday night, and we have to vote on this three days later.” He described the bill as “a rushed, unvetted and fossil fuel heavy-response” to the challenge of keeping the lights on.
But Muratsuchi still voted for the bill, implying the governor’s office or legislative leadership would be unhappy if he didn’t.
“In thewords of Marshawn Lynch, ‘I’m here because I don’t want to get fined,’” he said.
Other lawmakers supported the bill more enthusiastically. They included state Sen. Scott Wiener (D-San Francisco), who praised the provision allowing solar and wind energy developers facing opposition from local governments to seek state approval instead. As I wrotein my earlier story, local opposition is a growing obstacle to renewable energy in California and across the country.
“This bill will cut through that in so many ways, and make it much easier and faster to site and build these large-scale energy projects,” Wiener said. “That is what is going to put an end to fossil fuel reliance in the state of California.”
Not surprisingly, some legislators didn’t react so positively to state government taking away local control.State Sen. Jim Nielsen (R-Red Bluff) mentioned opposition from city and county governments to help explain his “no” vote. And Assemblymember Rebecca Bauer-Kahan (D-Orinda), who ultimately didn’t cast a vote either way, said Newsom’s plan fails to allow local communities to determine the right balance between building badly needed renewable energy projects and maintaining open space.
Perhaps the most interesting comments, though, came from state Sen. Shannon Grove (R-Bakersfield), astaunch Trump supporter. She taunted her Democratic colleagues, gleefully describing the bill as an acknowledgement that California needs fossil fuels to keep the lights on, and that without gas-fired power plants, “you will not be able to flip the switch to get electricity.”
Various Democrats quickly disagreed, and indeed, there’splenty of evidence100% clean electricity is possible, if not tomorrow or next year then likely next decade. The challenge, as I’vewritten previously, is getting there — without blackouts along the way.
That’s the needle California is struggling to thread right now.The world is watching to see if we get it right.
On that note, here’s what else is happening around the West:
Ancient bristlecone pines can survive almost anything — but rising temperatures, worsening drought and bark beetles are starting to kill the world’s oldest trees.The Times’ Louis Sahagún and Carolyn Cole journeyed to California’s White Mountains with scientists who areworking to protect the iconic pines— the oldest of which, Methuselah, has been growing its gnarled limbs for 4,853 years. Elsewhere in the West, increasingly extreme drought and heat are fueling larger outbreaks of Mormon crickets — giant insects that ravage crops andfeast on their own dead, Claire Rush reports for the Associated Press. Climate change has also helped mosquitoes gain a foothold in California. Here’swhat you can do to protect yourself, via my colleague Karen Garcia.
The Colorado River is once again flowing to its endpoint at the Gulf of California — sort of.The Times’ Ian James, Luis Sinco and Albert Brave Tiger Lee teamed up for abeautiful story and video about the ecological revival underwayas pulses of water reach the Colorado River Delta. The less water humans use, the easier it will be to do that kind of restoration — and in a good sign, Southern California cities arefinally cutting back on water use, Hayley Smith reports. Other states have different strategies to balance water supply and demand. In Arizona, lawmakers approved a$1-billion plan to augment suppliesbut did nothing to stop rural groundwater over-pumping, the Arizona Republic’s Brandon Loomis writes. And in Utah, powerful cities and water districts keephamstringing efforts to save water, ProPublica’s Mark Olalde reports. Even a bill to study leaky pipes couldn’t get passed.
Fires started by humans spread faster, burn hotter and destroy more trees than those caused by lightning strikes.That’s according to new research from scientists at UC Irvine;here’s the storyfrom my colleague Corinne Purtill, who writes that lightning tends to spark wildfires in humid conditions when it’s more difficult for flames to spread, whereas humans “light campfires, flick cigarettes and use machinery all year long, including when it’s dry and windy.”Not great, Bob!This helps explain why California’s largest private landowner, lumber giant Sierra Pacific Industries, ispreemptively closingits Golden State lands to the public this summer, citing wildfire risk, as The Times’ Felicia Alvarez reports. On the upside, new research could make it easier to forecast wildfire season severity and monsoonal rainfall months in advance.Details herefrom Maddie Stone at the Washington Post.
Los Angeles County is returning Bruce’s Beach to descendants of the Black couple kicked out nearly a century ago.“To our knowledge, this is the first time the government has returned property to a Black family after acknowledging it had been improperly taken,” George Fatheree, a lawyer representing the Bruce family,told The Times’ Rosanna Xiaafter a unanimous vote by the L.A. County supervisors, adding, “We’re hopeful that it will not be the last.” For more details on the county’s plan, seeRosanna’s earlier story. Rosanna also wrote about Heal the Bay’s latest report card tracking California’scleanest and dirtiest beaches— and also the health risks of wading into Los Angeles County rivers and creeks. “When we’re talking about coastal water quality, we need to think of it as a watershed issue. We need to address this from summit to sea,” Heal the Bay’s Tracy Quinn says.
“Are riverbeds a category of land like any other, subject to privatization and enclosure? Or are they fundamentally unlike land: shared spaces for spiritual renewal and joy, rendered so precious in the West by their scarcity that it would be unjust to deny the public their pleasures?”So asks Ben Goldfarb in afascinating High Country News pieceon a court case that could revolutionize river access in Colorado, where private landowners control access to many riverbeds. In another access story, Brian Oaster writes for High Country News that Willamette Falls — the West’s biggest waterfall by volume — isnot open to the public.
Environmentalists and local property owners are suing to block a planned $2.5-billion expansion of Pacheco Reservoir in California’s Santa Clara County.Critics argue the Santa Clara Valley Water Districtfailed to conduct the necessary environmental reviewsfor a project they say would destroy wildlife habitat and cultural sites, my colleague Nathan Solis reports; supporters say the project is needed to assure adequate water supplies and would actually benefit a species of steelhead trout. Public utilities in the Pacific Northwest, meanwhile, have spentmore than $2 million in ratepayer moneyon a public relations campaign to convince policymakers not to tear down four dams on the Lower Snake River in Washington, Hal Bernton reports for the Seattle Times.
Los Angeles could become the biggest U.S. city to ban new gas stations.Details herefrom the Guardian’s Dani Anguiano. Of course, reducing our dependence on gasoline will be a lot more challenging, especially given the political power of the oil industry. Look no further thanthis storyby the Press Democrat’s Mary Callahan, about a state lawmaker — Assemblymember Jim Cooper (D-Elk Grove) — who killed a bill that would have required California’s powerful public employee pension funds to divest from fossil fuels, after previously receiving a bunch of campaign money from oil and gas firms. Lawmakers are more focused on gasoline prices, striking a $9.5-billion deal with Gov. Gavin Newsom tosend tax refunds to Californians, as The Times’ Taryn Luna reports.
California is the nation’s second-largest cement producer, and cement accounts for 2% of its greenhouse gas emissions.A law passed last year requires the industry to reach net-zero emissions by 2045, and several new bills proposed by lawmakers are designed to help make that happen, according to Nadia Lopez at CalMatters, who wrote asuper interesting storyon what cement producers are doing to clean up their act. It’s a crucial issue globally, too; not only have cement emissions doubled over the last 20 years, the carbon intensity of cement productionis actually going up, not down, per Seth Borenstein at the Associated Press.
Gold mining executive Ben Mossman — who’s currently on trial in Canada on charges related to water contamination — is trying to reopen a long-shuttered Sierra Nevada gold mine with a toxic history.My colleague Hailey Branson-Potts talked with Grass Valley residentsfighting to block Mossman’s plan. “Water is our gold,” Christy Hubbard said. “We’re at the very center of the drought. We’re on the front lines of climate change here. We live in a forest, for heaven’s sake, that’s been really hit by drought.”
The closure of a big coal plant in New Mexico, originally planned for this month, has been delayed through at least the end of the summer as electricity demand outstrips supply.The difficulty of shutting down San Juan Generating Stationillustrates the challengesfacing the Land of Enchantment’s 100% clean energy law, as Jonathan Thompson writes for High Country News. His story features an interesting appearance by Western States and Tribal Nations, an advocacy group funded in part by fossil fuel companies that Iwrote about a couple years ago. We also shouldn’t forget that the extreme heat driving up demand for electricity has lots of other dangerous impacts, starting withhuman health risks. Other impacts are less obvious. Just last week, for instance, extreme heatcaused a BART train to derailin Northern California, my colleague Felicia Alvarez reports. Expect more of this.
Scientists have found small levels of several chemicals linked to cancer in natural gas delivered to homes.Here’s the storyfrom Elena Shao at the New York Times. The research took place in the Boston area, but it’s relevant to theongoing debateover phasing out gas heating and stoves in California. In other gas news, the California Public Utilities Commission ordered Pacific Gas & Electric topay a $1.27-million finefor failure to promptly fix pipeline safety issues; separately, new data shows that heat-trapping methane emissions aresoaring around the world,including in the Permian Basin in Texas and New Mexico (stories by Olivia Wynkoop at Bay City News Foundation and Steven Mufson at the Washington Post). In one more pollution story, Adam Mahoney wrote apowerful piecefor Grist and High Country News about a Wilmington family that has seen three generations stricken by cancer in one of Southern California’s most contaminated places, surrounded by oil refineries, ports and heavy truck traffic.
Consultants working for Florida Power & Light — a subsidiary of NextEra Energy, America’s biggest power company — covertly monitored a journalist who had written critically about the utility, sharing his social security number and other sensitive info with an FPL executive.Here’s theabsolutely insane storyfrom the Orlando Sentinel’s Annie Martin and Floodlight’s Mario Alejandro Ariza. I’m sharing this story here mostly because NextEra also does a lot of business in California; it operates a bunch of renewable energy facilities and is also trying to build apumped hydropower plantjust outside Joshua Tree National Park. In other surprising energy news, it turns out a secretive solar farm in Colorado ispowering a cryptocurrency mining operation— and the company behind it all is based in El Segundo, Calif., also home to the L.A. Times, the Colorado Sun’s Mark Jaffe reports.
Comedian John Oliver hosted alengthy segmenton the Colorado River in the latest episode of “Last Week Tonight.” You should check it out. The segment ends with an appearance from God — played by “Succession” star Brian Cox — who has a blunt message for us: “I want humans of all faiths to come together and act like rational f***ing adults when it comes to water use.”
Oliver’s segment is impressively detailed, although I do have one critique: He neglects to mention the Imperial Irrigation District, the powerful California agency that controls more Colorado River water than anyone. For more details, seemy recent story.

"Los Angeles to launch ‘extreme heat campaign’ Friday, says city’s first heat officer",https://www.latimes.com/environment/story/2022-06-30/los-angeles-first-heat-officer-climate-change-saving-lives,2022-06-30,"As a child growing up in San Jose,  Marta Segura heard horrific stories from her parents about women fainting on the factory lines and men overheating in the farm fields. They didn’t know those jobs exposed them to life-threatening conditions.
Then, it hit home.
“My dad, himself, got really sick one time and almost died,” said Segura, 58, the daughter ofabraceroand a cannery worker. “That resonated with me as a kid.”
Segura, who serves as director of Los Angeles’Climate Emergency Mobilization Officein the Department of Public Works, was given a second title this month: chief heat officer, the city’s first. She joins a number of heat officers around the world as cities fromAthens, Greece, toSantiago, Chile, begin to coordinate a better response to extreme heat and develop sustainable cooling strategies. Phoenix and Miami are the only other U.S. cities with heat officers.
Climate & Environment
Read all of our coverage about how California is neglecting the climate threat posed by extreme heat.
As Los Angeles continues to experience more frequentheat waves, Segura will work across city departments to help create an early-warning system for heat waves and develop long-term strategies to reduce heat exposure, such as planting trees and updating building codes. Her office will also launch asocial media campaignin July in English and Spanish.
Very high temperatures  can cause cramps, heat stroke, and heat exhaustion. Extreme heat contributed to the deaths of around 12,000 people in the U.S. each year from 2010 to 2020, according to a study by the University of Washington. Those figures are likely to rise. A Times investigation last year found thatCalifornia greatly undercounts the number of residents who die in heat waves.
Low-income, majority-minority neighborhoods experience significantly more heat than wealthier, whiter neighborhoods,according to researchersfrom the University of California, San Diego’s School of Global Policy and Strategy. The research shows that surface temperatures in communities with higher rates of poverty can be up to 7 degrees Fahrenheit warmer, compared with the richest neighborhoods, during summer.
“Neighborhoods in South Los Angeles send an additional 20 to 30 people to the emergency room on heat days compared to 2 additional people from wealthier neighborhoods,” said Dr. David Eisenman, director of the Center for Public Health and Disasters at UCLA. Eisenman will work with Segura to identify climate-vulnerable communities.
Segura, 58, takes her new job as state lawmakers consider expanding heat warnings.Assembly Bill 2076would establish California’s first chief heat officer position and create a statewide extreme-heat and community resilience program.Assembly Bill 2238would create the nation’s first warning system for heat waves, just as existing systems warn of other natural disasters, such as wildfires, tornadoes, and hurricanes.
KHN reporter Heidi de Marco met with Segura in her City Hall office to discuss her new role and how she plans to tackle the city’s climate risk. The interview has been edited for length and clarity.
Q: Why was this position created?
We’ve noticed a fivefold increase in extreme heat events and heat waves. There are more heat-related illnesses and more hospitalizations and deaths.
There are two goals. The first is changes to the system — the services and the infrastructure of the city. The other is education and awareness — that people know that extreme heat is more serious so they can take steps to protect themselves.
Climate & Environment
What are heat-related illnesses and how are they treated? Are they preventable or inevitable? We talked to health experts for the answers.
We’re tackling education with an extreme-heat campaign that will launch July 1. In terms of changing the system and services, the city is painting the roofs and roads with white, cool[ing] paint, planting more trees for maximum shade in vulnerable communities.
Q: You will be working to reduce heat-related hospitalizations and deaths, as well as working with different city agencies to implement a heat action plan. How will that work?
We’re already discussing updating our building codes for decarbonization and climate adaptation.
The other approach is through public works. For example, installing more shade structures, more kiosks, especially for metro and bus transportation furniture. They’re also installing more hydration stations.
So when you add that to our public facilities — parks, libraries, youth centers, which are all accessible during the day — you have a lot of opportunities to tell people where to go in the event of a heat storm or heat wave.
Q: How do you plan to address inequality?
It keeps me up at night. Addressing the most vulnerable community isn’t out of charity. And it isn’t because of moral reasons. It’s because if we don’t help the most vulnerable communities of Los Angeles, which are over 50% of the population, we’re not going to get to our climate solutions.
California
Paved surfaces, tree cover, and home construction quality can make the difference between heat waves being an inconvenience or a threat to your life.
Landlords are less likely to invest in heat pumps or other air conditioning systems because that would only raise the rent, and the rent would displace individuals. So we need a policy in the city of L.A. that prevents displacement and helps in some ways to subsidize those low-income housing units or find financing structures that allow landlords to be able to invest and keep our families healthy and safe.
Q: Is there a particular challenge in messaging to immigrant communities?
I think what I learned in my family is we tend to have the radio on as we go about our work. So it’s going to be important to use radio. It’s also going to be important to use text messaging services, like WhatsApp.
We want to make sure to get this information out to employers, so we probably need to come up with culturally relevant communications. It’s an evolving campaign.
Q: What kind of budget are you working with?
We will be allocating approximately 30% of our budget to heat-risk prevention work, and although our budget is not large, our impact on other partner departments, such as public works and the emergency management department, is significant.
We can’t look at my budget in a silo since the council has directed us to work collaboratively to combine the respective parts of our budgets for heat-risk prevention. However, I can say that my office will be doubling in size, from four to eight [employees], and this will give us the leverage and resources we need to make the kind of impact the city of L.A. seeks to make in the long run.
Q: How do you plan to address the homeless community?
What we actually would like to have are more pop-up units, where we have canopies and hydration.
So that’s a conversation I’m having with our deputy mayor of homelessness and housing so that we can coordinate together. And that’s a good example of something that my office can’t do alone because I need their expertise and their allocated resources to ensure that we’re providing the best available comprehensive resources for the city.
Q: You are the first Latina to hold such a position in the United States. How does that feel?
It’s significant because [Latinos] have been suffering disproportionately from climate hazards for a very long time, and we haven’t had positions like this in the past. If they see someone from their community, or that looks like they’re from their community, that speaks their language, that culturally relates to them, that has had similar experiences, I think it makes a big difference, right?

"Wildfire in Northern California burns in ‘dangerous’ terrain, grows to 904 acres",https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2022-06-29/rices-fire-northern-california-nevada-county-dangerous-terrain,2022-06-30,"Firefighters continued to make progress against a wildfire burning in rugged terrain in Northern California’s remote Nevada County on Wednesday, but authorities warned that the work is far from over.
The Rices fire,which broke out Tuesday, had grown to 904 acres with 10% containment as of Wednesday night, said Brian Estes,  chief of the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection’s Nevada-Yuba Placer Unit.
“We are definitely far from being out of the woods, but we have shown some significant progress,” Estes said.
The fire burned down to the bottom of the Yuba River drainage overnight and in the early morning hours Wednesday, which firefighters had feared could put nearby communities in Yuba County in harm’s way. But crews have been able to prevent the fire from crossing the river, Estes said.
As of Wednesday night, the fire was “100% holding in Nevada County,” he said.
Science & Medicine
In California, wildfires caused by humans grow faster and become hotter than wildfires sparked by lightning, the studies show.
At the last check, around 6 p.m., hand crews on the fire’s left flank were about 1,000 feet from “cutting this out and tying it in to the bottom of the river canyon,” Estes said. On the right flank, crews were 150 feet from the river bottom.
“Just an incredible effort in some of the most unforgiving and treacherous terrain in our region,” Estes said. “I can’t understate the efforts from all of our Cal Fire firefighters, fire crews, our allied agencies and our representatives from across the region.”
Fire crews are working in one of the deepest, largest river canyons in Northern California, navigating terrain “punctuated with sharp corners and huge rock escarpments that are very much like sheer cliffs,” Estes said.
“At night, that becomes especially dangerous,” he said. “We try always to go as direct as possible to the fire line. It’s the safest and most effective way to fight fire, but there are areas on this canyon … where you physically cannot get people over some of these rock escarpments.”
In an evening update, Cal Fire officials said five firefighters have been injured. They did not state the extent or nature of the injuries.
Investigators determined that the fire began in a structure before spreading to surrounding vegetation, Estes said. What caused the structure fire remains under investigation.
Authorities have confirmed only one structure destroyed, Estes said, but there are almost certainly others. Earlier Wednesday, Cal Fire had reported four structures destroyed.
“We know there are more, and already, starting tonight and well into tomorrow, our damage inspection teams will be canvassing the area in great detail,” Estes said.
Once that survey is done, by Thursday afternoon or evening, authorities will have a much more accurate picture of the number of structures damaged or destroyed.
Climate & Environment
Toothbrush, socks, charger — check. But do you have a wildfire evacuation plan for your Airbnb or other vacation rental?
“We’ve got a big fire fight on our hands tomorrow,” Estes said. “While you may not have seen the plumes and the columns that you saw in the first 24 hours, rest assured there is plenty of fire underneath that inversion.”
Authorities hope to have the blaze contained by Friday, but that  remains subject to change.
Evacuation orders remain in place in four zones of Nevada County, said Capt. Sam Brown of the Nevada County Sheriff’s Office.
Authorities estimate about 250 residences, and about 300 people,  are in areas affected by those orders, Brown said.
An additional five zones in Nevada County are under evacuation warnings, he said.
A detailed map of areas under evacuation orders and warnings is posted atreadynevadacounty.org/dashboard.
As of Wednesday, there were a little more than 700 personnel assigned to the Rices fire, Estes said. Crews planned to work through the night.

Los Angeles Times Earns L.A. Press Club’s Southern California Journalism Awards for Range of Work,https://www.latimes.com/about/pressreleases/story/2022-06-29/l-a-times-times-community-news-and-l-a-times-today-dazzle-in-los-angeles-press-club-competition,2022-06-29,"The Los Angeles Times, Times Community News, L.A. Times Studios and “L.A. Times Today” were honored by theLos Angeles Press Clubfor a wide range of work in the 64th annual Southern California Journalism Awards, which were announced at a gala on June 25.
Among the highlights, Foreign Correspondent and Photographer Marcus Yam was honored with the Daniel Pearl Award for Courage and Integrity in Journalism. Yam, who recently won thePulitzer Prize for Breaking News Photographyfor images documenting the U.S. departure from Afghanistan, called the award “a great privilege and honor,” noting he was “only a teenager” when he read about Daniel Pearl, the American journalist who was captured and later killed by terrorists in Pakistan.
“I did not know then that I was going to end up being a journalist later in my life,” Yam said. “But I remember that his story inspired me to live meaningfully. This award serves as a reminder that we have a responsibility to create work that fosters a better understanding of the world and can leave an impact on our readers, even in the face of danger.
“I hope I will be able to continue honoring Daniel’s life by striving to never shy away, and brave the unknown,” Yam added.
Yam was also named Photographer/Videographer of the Year in the contest, while Staff Writer Ryan Kartje was named Sports Journalist of the Year.
In announcing Kartje’s win, the competition’s judges noted that his sports reporting goes beyond the recounting of wins and losses, performance stats and standard analysis. “He is interested in what makes an athlete tick and what we (the readers) have in common with our heroes,” the judges wrote. “Kartje keeps it real. There is no tiptoeing along the sacred surface. The expressiveness of his writing is equal to his need to peel back the layers of a story. This is the kind of reporting that leads to a deeper understanding of our idols — and of ourselves.”

"Authorities seize 14,000 pounds of illegal fireworks in Azusa",https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2022-06-29/authorities-seize-14-000-pounds-of-fireworks-from-home-storage-facility-in-azusa,2022-06-29,"A tip led authorities to a stash of 14,000 pounds of illegal fireworks in Azusa just days before the Fourth  of July, the Los Angeles County district attorney’s office announced this week.
The fireworks were being stored at a home and storage facility, where investigators with the D.A.s office, the Azusa Police Department and the L.A. County fire and sheriff’s departments also found more than $10,000 in cash and an illegal firearm during an operation on Monday.
Twenty-seven homes were evacuated from the 900 block of West Hollyvale Street on Monday afternoon while the explosives were removed, according to the Azusa Police Department.
The D.A.’s office said one person was detained in connection with the investigation.
California
Anyone found guilty of selling, possessing or using illegal fireworks in L.A. can face a $1,000 fine and/or jail, City Atty. Mike Feuer said.
Fireworks are illegal in L.A. County’s unincorporated areas and in many of its cities due to “brush fires, house fires, millions of dollars in damages, injuries and even death they may cause,” the D.A.’s office said in a news release about the seizure, adding that residents are encouraged to report any illegal fireworks to law enforcement.
Officials have warned that fireworks areespecially dangerous this yearbecause of severe drought conditions, which can enable wildfires to spread quickly.
Some California cities have canceled their fireworks displays this year due to the elevated fire danger, including shows inLompocand atLake Don Pedro.
Lifestyle
Whether you want to stay close to home or go event-hopping, here’s a list of places around L.A. where you can celebrate the nation’s birthday and catch a dazzling fireworks display.
“I am grateful that we could assist local law enforcement in protecting this community from the potential dangers posed by illegal fireworks,” Dist. Atty. George Gascón said in a statement about the seizure.
Last year, the Los Angeles Police Department came under intense scrutiny over its handling of a fireworks seizure in South Los Angeles, whichended with a large explosionthat injured 17 people.
The Sheriff’s Department’s bomb squad worked to remove the fireworks on Monday,according to Azusa police. Residents were allowed to return to their homes around 10:15 p.m.

Newsom has a plan to keep the lights on in California — using fossil fuels,https://www.latimes.com/environment/story/2022-06-28/newsoms-energy-bill,2022-06-29,"A controversial plan from Gov. Gavin Newsom would reshape how business is done on the California power grid, potentially helping to extend the life of beachfront gas plants and the Diablo Canyon nuclear plant, making it easier for solar and wind farm developers to sidestep local government opposition, and limiting environmental reviews for all kinds of energy projects.
State lawmakers could vote as early as Wednesday night on the polarizing legislation, whose text was revealed late Sunday.
The billwould give the Department of Water Resources unprecedented authority to build or buy energy from any facility that can help keep the lights on during the next few summers — including polluting diesel generators and four gas-fired power plants along the Southern California coast that were originally supposed to close in 2020 but wererescued by state officials.
Those decisions would be exempt from the normal public input process under the California Environmental Quality Act — and from approval by agencies such as the California Coastal Commission and local air quality management districts.
A separate provision would allow companies building solar farms, wind turbines and lithium-ion batteries — as well as electric lines to connect those facilities to the grid — to opt in to an accelerated approval process that doesn’t require sign-off from county governments. State officials would be required to conduct environmental reviews and approve or deny those projects within nine months. Legal challenges to any project approvals would need to be resolved by state courts within another nine months.

The legislation is technically a follow-up to the state budget approved by lawmakers earlier this month. It’s part of the Newsom administration’s frenetic effort to address twin challenges: the risk of blackouts and the growing dangers of the climate crisis.
It’s been almost two years sincebrief rolling blackoutsroiled the state on two brutally hot August evenings when there wasn’t enough electricity supply to power millions of air conditioners after the sun went down and solar panels stopped generating.
Electric utilities have managed to keep the lights on since then —barely. But preventing outages is only getting harder as fossil fuel emissions heat the planet, extreme droughtdrains hydropower reservoirsand worsening wildfires disrupt power lines.
Newsom responded last month by asking lawmakers to approve a $5.2-billion“strategic electricity reliability reserve”that would pay for emergency power supplies over the next few years. But he surprised many observers with Sunday’s proposal to let the Department of Water Resources secure those supplies through a special review process at the California Energy Commission, which critics say could limit opportunities for public input and lead to more pollution in low-income communities of color.
The strategic reserve “is an insurance policy that will only be used when we face potential shortfall during extreme climate-change driven events (e.g. heatwaves, wildfire disruptions to transmission),” the Newsom administration says in abill summary.
But the governor’s proposal startled climate activists, energy developers and local officials.
In anopposition letterTuesday, two dozen groups — including the Sierra Club, the California Environmental Justice Alliance, the National Parks Conservation Assn. and Audubon — said Newsom’s plan has gone through hardly any public review.
Alexis Sutterman, energy equity manager at the California Environmental Justice Alliance, called the bill “incredibly dangerous.”
“It’s putting billions of dollars into keeping fossil fuel infrastructure online at a time when we should be doing everything we can to move away from fossil fuels, both for equity and the sake of our climate,” Sutterman said.
Climate & Environment
Read all of our coverage about how California is neglecting the climate threat posed by extreme heat.
Especially controversial are gas-fired power plants in Redondo Beach, Huntington Beach, Long Beach and Oxnard that were supposed to shut down by the end of 2020 under a decade-old policy requiring coastal power plants to stop sucking up large amounts of ocean water — a process known as “once through cooling” that kills fish and other marine life. In a series of decisions after the August 2020 rolling blackouts, the state water board agreed tolet those plants keep operatingthree more years.
If the Legislature approves Newsom’s plan, the Department of Water Resources could buy energy from those plants beyond 2023 — or even buy the facilities outright, critics fear. That possibility has leftRedondo Beach Mayor Bill Brandfeeling blindsided.
“We feel double-crossed,” Brand said. “These retirement dates were set 12 years ago.”
Ana Matosantos, Newsom’s cabinet secretary, told The Times the gas plants won’t be allowed to stay open after 2023 without approval from the state water board — an interpretation disputed by climate activists, who say the bill clearly states otherwise.
For the record:
7:26 a.m. June 29, 2022An earlier version of this article incorrectly stated that the Diablo Canyon nuclear plant is planned to close in 2026. Its closure is scheduled for 2025.
Matosantos also downplayed speculation that the bill would save the Diablo Canyon nuclear plant, currentlyslated to close in 2025. While she acknowledged that the Department of Water Resources could, in theory, buy some electricity from the nuclear plant, she said keeping it open past 2025 would require additional legislation, as well as approval from federal agencies.
Under Newsom’s proposal, the Department of Water Resources would also be able to contract for large energy storage projects such as lithium-ion batteries. Any newly purchased diesel backup generators would need to stop operating after July 2023.
Climate & Environment
Delaying the closure of Diablo Canyon would mark a shift for nuclear politics as the climate crisis worsens.
The bill also includes $200 million for programs thatpay people and businesses to use less energywhen the grid is stressed.
For longtime clean energy lobbyist V. John White, Newsom’s plan is a necessary evil. The Public Utilities Commission, he said, has put California in an impossible position by failing to line up climate-friendly resources that can provide power after sundown — such as batteries,geothermal plantsandlong-duration energy storage— even though the agency has known for more than a decade that the coastal gas plants would shut down, and since 2016 that the Diablo Canyon reactors would soon join them.
“These are extraordinary circumstances,” White said. “The tragedy here is we have plenty of wind and solar and geothermal to buy, but we waited so long that now we’re having trouble getting it online in time to meet the needs that we have.”
Climate & Environment
State officials say a 100% climate-friendly power mandate doesn’t necessarily mean no natural gas.
Even as Newsom scrambles to keep the lights on during the next few summers, White said, the governor needs to show stronger climate leadership and develop a long-term strategy to accelerate renewable energy while avoiding power supply emergencies.
The other controversial provision in Newsom’s proposal could help on that front, by allowing solar and wind developers to seek faster approval from the Energy Commission — although even those companies aren’t sure how much difference it would make.
Local governments have at times emerged as a serious obstacle to clean energy, with San Bernardino County supervisorsbanning solar and wind farmson more than 1 million acres in 2019 and Shasta County supervisors set to vote next month on a wind farmmoratorium.ShastaandHumboldtcounties have both rejected proposed wind farms in recent years — an increasingly common occurrence across the Western U.S. as local residents raise concerns aboutenvironmental damageanddiminished views.
Major solar companies have been focused on building better relationships with local officials rather than pushing to circumvent county approval, several people familiar with the industry’s thinking told The Times. The California Wind Energy Assn., on the other hand, supports Newsom’s plan to let the state handle permitting where developers prefer it, executive director Nancy Rader said.
The plan for speedier solar and wind approvals has also drawn support from the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers. Developers who opt in to the streamlined process would need to hire union workers through project labor agreements.
“We think that’s a wise balancing of an option for developers who have their ducks in a row and want to go to the Energy Commission, which is extremely capable and competent and talented,” said Marc Joseph, an attorney representing IBEW.

Major environmental groups haven’t taken a position on Newsom’s proposal to streamline project approval, after an earlier provision that would have eliminated additional layers of review — including from the Coastal Commission — was removed.
Local governments, though, are furious.
In aletteropposing the bill, the California State Assn. of Counties, Urban Counties of California, Rural County Representatives of California and the League of California Cities said renewable energy facilities “can have enormous impacts on local communities.” They said the Energy Commission approval process is “overly broad, usurps local control, excludes local governments from meaningful involvement in major development projects within their jurisdictions, and could result in even more litigation.”
The Department of Water Resources pathway, meanwhile, is “an unprecedented law change with no policy hearing,” said Catherine Freeman, a legislative representative at the county association. She called it “a complete removal of local permitting.”
Even if the bill passes, California will have plenty of challenges trying to reach 100% clean energy by 2045, as required by state law — a timeline Newsom has saidshould be sped up. The state will need to build solar farms, wind turbines and other clean energy resources at anunprecedented rate— especially as the growth of electric cars andelectric heatingdrives up power demand.
For the next few summers, all eyes will be on the California Independent System Operator, which is responsible for balancing supply and demand across most of the state — and calling for rolling blackouts if there’s not enough electricity to go around.
So was the grid operator involved in crafting Newsom’s proposal? That’s not entirely clear. Spokesperson Anne Gonzales said only that the agency “offered technical assistance and reviewed specific provisions that would require [our] involvement.”
“The strategic reserves are primarily meant to support reliability beginning in summer 2023,” she said in an email.

"Wildfire destroys four structures, threatens 500 more in rural Northern California",https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2022-06-28/rices-fire-burns-northern-california-nevada-county,2022-06-29,"At least four structures have been destroyed and more than 500 others are threatened by a growing wildfire in Northern California’s rural Nevada County, fueled by a “critically dry” and “drought-stressed” environment, according to an update fromfrom Cal Fire officials.
The fire has burned 769 acres as of 7 a.m. Wednesday, growing by almost 200 acres overnight, and is still 0% contained, the update said. Multiple residential communities in the area are under evacuation orders and warnings, as almost 650 firefighters battle the blaze.
At least one firefighter has been injured, according to the latest report, but details were  not immediately available.
The Rices fire started around 2 p.m. Tuesday in the area of Rices Crossing Road, north of the south fork of the Yuba River and west of the community of North San Juan, said Brian Estes, unit chief of the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection’s Nevada-Yuba Placer Unit.
“Steep and rugged terrain, critically dry and receptive fuel beds, active area for fire history and drought-stressed trees are leading to the observed active fire behavior,” the latest update said.
Science & Medicine
In California, wildfires caused by humans grow faster and become hotter than wildfires sparked by lightning, the studies show.
The cause of the blaze remains under investigation.
Residents initially tried to put out the fire, but when the first units arrived about 10 minutes after authorities received a report, it was being driven by the dry, windy conditions, Estes said.
The fire was burning in brush, oak woodlands and heavy timber, moving to the north and northeast toward the Yuba River drainage, Estes said. Temperatures during the day were above 96 degrees, relative humidity was below 10% and winds of at least 8 mph were blowing out of the southwest.
Among the 500 structures  threatened is  critical infrastructure such as water delivery and Pacific Gas & Electric Co. electrical systems, Estes said. South Yuba River State Park was also threatened.
Climate & Environment
Toothbrush, socks, charger — check. But do you have a wildfire evacuation plan for your Airbnb or other vacation rental?
“Our main efforts in the suppression … of this fire now are to keep it from dropping into the Yuba River drainage,” he said.
If the fire crosses the drainage into Yuba County, it could “have some tremendous impacts” to communities such as Dobbins and Oregon House, he said.
“We are one of the few, large dynamic incidents going on in the state, so the support that we’ve received … has been tremendous,” Estes said.
Mandatory evacuation orders are  in place for four zones, including the communities of Birchville, Sweetland, French Corral, Bridgeport, Rice’s Crossing and the Buttermilk area, according to Cal Fire.
Adjacent zones to the north are  under evacuation warnings, including North San Juan, Sebastopol, New School, Robinson, Greater Tyler Foote, northern Purdon Road, Millhouse, Montezuma and Central Purdon.
A detailed map of areas under evacuation orders and warnings is postedonline.
A temporary evacuation point is open at the Madelyn Helling Library in Nevada City, according to the Nevada County Office of Emergency Services.
California
Crews continued to increase containment of the Union fire in and near the Santa Ana Riverbed, officials said.
The Nevada County Fairgrounds in Grass Valley are receiving animals, the Sheriff’s Office said.
Residents of neighboring Yuba County in areas north of Marysville Road, Troost Trail, Fairhaven Drive, Lake Francis Road, and south and east of Marysville Road were placed under an evacuation advisory and told to be on the alert for changing conditions, officials said.

California banned the sale of kangaroo leather years ago. Lawsuits contest its continued presence,https://www.latimes.com/environment/story/2022-07-31/california-shoe-shops-accused-of-selling-kangaroo-leather,2022-07-31,"It’s a battle that has raged in California since then-Gov. Ronald Reagan first signed legislation banning the sale of kangaroo meat and leather in 1970, after years of unregulated killing.
Today, the population of Australian kangaroos has rebounded, but the controversy shows little chance of cooling as animal welfare advocates accuse California retailers of ignoring the ban and continuing to sell soccer shoes made from kangaroo skin.
So-called K-leather — which is prized for its strength, light weight and suppleness — is the product of a brutal and inhumane system of harvesting that slaughters up to 2 million kangaroos a year, animal advocates say.
Recently, two national animal welfare groups filed suit against Riverside County-based Soccer Wearhouse Inc., using the same legal strategy animal rights groups used against the sale of foie gras.
According to the lawsuit, the plaintiffs have “suffered economic injury” because the retailers’ alleged “unfair business practices” have diverted resources from their core mission: “advocating for improved animal welfare, a more humane economy, and better protection laws — for kangaroos specifically, and for other animals.”
“K-leather soccer cleats are openly sold throughout California by various retail stores,” states the lawsuit filed by Animal Wellness Action and the Center for a Humane Economy. “These stores make no attempt to hide the fact that these products contain kangaroo parts; in fact, many store employees are forthright and honest about which shoe models are made of kangaroo leather and openly acknowledge that the sale of such products is illegal in the state.”
California
An increase in catastrophic wildfires has reduced California tree cover by 6.7% since 1985, and researchers fear the lost trees will never grow back.
The plaintiffs are demanding that the court order the retailer to stop selling kangaroo leather shoes and to reimburse the animal welfare groups for their legal fees.
The lawsuit was “just the first in several we intend to bring if retailers in the state don’t heed our warning and continue to break the law,” said Natasha Dolezal, deputy director of campaigns for the Center for a Humane Economy.
Dariush Adli, an attorney representing Soccer Wearhouse, said the company’s owners “say they were not aware of these items being illegal in California until a few months ago. They do not sell them anymore.”
California — the nation’s largest market for soccer equipment — is the only state to ban the importation and sale of kangaroo parts. The prohibition remains one of the state’s most divisive environmental issues.
As envisioned when it was enacted in 1970, the ban was intended to reduce the annual slaughter of millions of Australia’s giant marsupials. The law was also aimed at protecting other species that the Legislature found were imperiled abroad: the polar bear, leopard, tiger, cheetah, jaguar, zebra and elephant.
In 2007, the California Supreme Court unanimously decided the ban was not preempted by federal wildlife law. But at the urging of the Australian government, the Legislature twice lifted the ban: in 2007 for three years, and again in 2010 for five years.
At the behest of the Australian government, Assemblyman Mike Gipson (D-Carson) in 2015 took a bill he’d steered through the Assembly to regulate card club employees, stripped it and replaced its contents with language permanently allowing kangaroo parts to be imported and sold here.
That so-called “gut and amend” maneuver didn’t come to a vote because of broad bipartisan opposition.
In 2020, theCalifornia Department of Fish and Wildlife’slaw enforcement division sent written notifications to 66 soccer gear businesses throughout the state to inform them about the ban and warn them that violations are punished as misdemeanors.
Soccer Wearhouse was among the businesses notified, state wildlife authorities said, as was Niky’s Sports, California’s largest soccer retailer, which announced in 2021 that it stopped selling products made of kangaroo leather.
Climate & Environment
A lawsuit seeks to bar the county from developing any new river project without first conducting a review of significant environmental impacts.
A year ago, U.S. Rep. Salud Carbajal (D-Santa Barbara) introduced the Kangaroo Protection Act, federal legislation that would ban the importation and sale of kangaroo body parts in the United States.
When it comes towildlife trafficking in California, the kangaroo skin trade is only part of the problem.
The monumental workload of the state’s six-man Wildlife Trafficking Unit includes targeting restricted species that can carry pathogens that infect humans, as well as violations involving species facing extinction, such as the illegal trade of elephant ivory and rhinoceros horn, said Capt. Patrick Foy, a spokesman for the Department of Fish and Wildlife.
As of this year, the unit has seized roughly $5.2 million worth of illegal ivory and filed 38 related cases to city and county prosecutors, Foy said.
But thus far, there’s been little action to enforce the ban on kangaroo products, said Kate Schultz, senior attorney for the Center for a Humane Economy. “So we’re taking the alleged violators to court ourselves.”
The nonprofit animal welfare groups have their work cut out for them in California, home to an estimated 124 independent soccer retail stores.
Beyond brick-and-mortar stores, Center for a Humane Economy investigators found that some manufacturers of soccer cleats sell their kangaroo models to Californians directly from their websites.
In the meantime, Wayne Pacelle, president of Animal Wellness Action, has been touting the benefits of soccer cleats made from alternative fabrics.
Of the total 123 goals scored at the 2020 European Football  Championships, he said, “115, or 93.5%, came from players wearing synthetic, non-leather shoes.”
“So at a time when kangaroos in Australia are being decimated by cruel harvests,bushfires,pollution and development,” he said, “the least we can do is protect these fascinating animals from mass slaughter that turns them into soccer cleats.”

Why forest managers need to team up with Indigenous fire practitioners,https://www.latimes.com/opinion/story/2022-07-31/west-wildfire-prescribed-burn-indigenous-fire-practices,2022-07-31,"The forests of the Western United States are facing an unprecedented crisis, besieged by wildfires and climate change. There is a precedent for part of the solution, though: intentional burns such as those set by Indigenous peoples.
Many of our forested ecosystems depend on fire. They evolved with frequent blazes touched off by humans or lightning. However, active stewardship was disrupted, first by the genocide and forced removal of Indigenous peoples, then by the criminalization of cultural burning activities, and finally by the misguided efforts of state and federal governments to immediately suppress all ignitions. We are left with significantly altered forest structures and dangerous fuel loads, both of which significantly contribute to the current wildfire crisis.
Both Western science and Indigenous knowledge point to the need to return fire as a keystone process, as critical to ecosystem health as sunlight and rain. Land managers and cultural fire practitioners intentionally light fires when conditions are such that they can be managed or self-limiting, practices known as prescribed fire and cultural burning.
Indigenous practitioners have long known that these place-based fire and land stewardship practicesencourage the growth of food and useful plants and offer community protection. More recently, scientists from across the West have realized the effectiveness and necessity of using these practices to build resiliency, even as the climate changes. Public agencies such as the Forest Service and Park Servicenow manage some wildfires similarly, but only when fires are away from infrastructure and private lands. Consensus is emerging thatthesepractices(cultural burns, prescribed fire and managed wildfire) are critical tools to address wildfire risk and forest health across the West.
We have recently convened a partnership of scientists and Indigenous leaders from across the Western states to advocate for the kinds of policy solutions necessary to build beneficial relations between people and the land and to restore resilience to our ecosystems. We call for change by federal and state policymakers, land managers and fire agencies in four main areas.
First, state and federal governments must commit to active stewardship in a manner we have not seen before. Entire landscapes are now endangered, and we must begin implementing ecosystem-level solutions.
Second, active stewardship must include restoration of tribal stewardship across both public and private lands. The Biden administration and a handful of states have called for tribal co-management of public lands. Cultural fire practitioners must have the right to engage in fire management activities according to traditional Indigenous law. And federal and state governments must support long-term action with funding for tribal practitioners so they can expand capacity to do the work.
Third, federal land management agencies need the staffing to actively manage forests. Across the Western United States, the federal government manages around 45% of all lands and over 65% of forest ecosystems. Active stewardship of these expansive lands requires a significantly larger workforce with updated training to align with this new approach. If we are going to return beneficial fire to the landscape — as we must — we cannot expect exhausted fire suppression crews to take care of the needed work in their off-season.
Fourth, we must acknowledge that fire is part of our baseline environmental condition. Our bedrock environmental laws, including the National Environmental Policy Act, the Clean Water and Clean Air acts, and the Endangered Species Act, were adopted at a time when fire suppression was at its peak. We designed these laws withthe faulty assumption that people could fully exclude fireand keep our air free from smoke and our ecosystems intact. Therefore, they treat our suite of fire stewardship practices the same as other human activity – akin to building a freeway or power plant – with the attendant regulatory review.
But fire will burn in one form or another. We need to develop laws and policies that encourage the kind of fire that people and ecosystems need. We cannot have clean water, clean air and critical wildlife habitat if we don’t first have resilient, fire-adapted forests.
We do not ignore the risks inherent in these solutions. The Forest Service recently acknowledged that its intentional fires were the ignition source for the Calf Canyon and Hermits Peak fires — vast and destructive blazes in New Mexico this year, the sort of fire that is never a goal of intentional burns. These events must be carefully studied and learned from. But calls to pause or otherwise shut down all use of fire are misguided. In nearly all cases, prescribed fires are kept within the confines of the planning area. The Forest Service’sdecision in May to pause such intentional burnssends the wrong message to the public that these tools are inherently unsafe.
Perhaps more important, removing cultural and prescribed fire will make the threat of wildfires worse in the long run. Rather than focus on the source of the ignition as the “cause” of the harms from megafires, we need to focus on the condition of the forest. The current lack of resilience across much of the American West is largely responsible for the devastating effects.Keeping fire and other restoration techniques out of the landscapeonly makes infernos more likely and more expansive.
We have begun to imagine what “beneficial relations” might look like between people and our forested lands and call for a new stewardship policy. But we cannot implement them without fundamentally changing the systems we’ve built to try to keep fire out of our landscapes. The West is in a fire crisis. It is time to change the behaviors that caused it.

"Monster Northern California fire explodes, threatens multiple communities",https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2022-07-30/fire-near-california-oregon-border-grows-explosively-overnight,2022-07-31,"A fast-moving wildfire near the California border with Oregon continued to rage out of control Sunday, burning tens of thousands of acres and prompting evacuation orders for neighboring communities.
The McKinney fire is burning through heavy, drought-stressed timber in steep terrain in the Klamath National Forest west of Yreka, said Caroline Quintanilla, a public information officer.
It’s shaping up to be the most dangerous fire so far this season in California, threatening multiple communities. The U.S. Forest Service estimated the fire had grown to 51,468 acres as of Sunday morning with 0% containment.
Evacuation orderswere issuedfor multiple communities, including Scott Bar, Klamath River and Horse Creek. The orders encompassed at least 500 homes, according to the Siskiyou County Sheriff’s Office.
Western pockets of Yreka, the county seat, were ordered to evacuate Saturday night. All other areas of the city west of Interstate 5 were warned to prepare for the possibility of evacuation.
The dynamic situation forced firefighters to shift their efforts from controlling the perimeter of the fire to assisting with evacuations and defending structures, Quintanilla said.
A number of homes along the Shasta River have been destroyed, said Bryan Schenone, director of the county’s office of emergency management. Officials haven’t yet gotten an accurate count of the losses because of fire danger.

Gov. Gavin Newsom proclaimed a state of emergency for Siskiyou County on Saturday due to the effects of the McKinney fire. Two additional fires in the county, the China 2 and Evans fires, merged and were thought to have burned more than 300 acres in the afternoon. That was revised to 100 to 150 acres by evening.
Lisa Mott, 45, of Montague said she has friends whose parents have lost houses down in the Klamath River area. Mott, who works in Yreka and has family there, said the city has warned residents to be ready “in case the fire crests over the hill and comes toward the town.”
Ash fell on her car as she drove to the county seat Saturday afternoon, she said.
“We’re all preparing in case we have to evacuate the town,” she said. “People in town are starting to pack up, getting stuff ready.”
Mott spoke from her father’s house in Grenada, where she went to get their pickup and horse trailer ready in case they have to help friends and family evacuate.

The McKinney fire has ripped through 52,498 acres in Klamath National Forest. A red flag warning is in effect, and storms are expected.
Her family had planned to head to Redding for a scholarship dinner for her daughter that night, but decided to stay in case friends and family need their help.
“We’re just kind of all sitting, waiting to see what happens,” she said. “We’re all waiting to see what this fire does.”
Many residents are worried about the weather conditions, Mott said.
“The weather conditions here aren’t very favorable, and I think this afternoon that’s what we’re all worried about, the weather that’s supposed to be coming through,” she said.
Jon Fitzpatrick a 19-year resident of Yreka, lives on the edge of the evacuation warning zone with his wife and three sons. As of Saturday afternoon, the fire was reported to be nine miles west of them, just over a ridge. They could see a growing smoke cloud.
“We have fires every year in the surrounding areas,” he said. “But here in Yreka this is the first time I have felt like it could possibly threaten the town.”
He and his family packed clothes and toiletries and had important papers and pictures in baskets, ready to go.
“We will wait and see if it gets closer and as soon as they say to go, we will put the rest of the things in the car, load up the dogs, and head out,” he said.
A pastor in the community, Fitzpatrick said he was “more concerned for our older people who will have a bigger challenge getting out of town if need be.”
He said that there was a dusting of ash, but it wasn’t too bad given the direction of the wind. But he knew conditions could change.“This thing is a beast,” he said.
The firestarted Friday afternoonon the south side of the Klamath River amid record-breaking heat and grew to 800 acres by Friday night.
A weather station in Montague, down in the Shasta Valley to the east of the fire, had recorded six days of triple-digit temperatures that peaked Friday at 111 degrees, with the heat breaking daily records each day Monday through Friday, according to preliminary National Weather Service data. On Wednesday, Thursday and Friday, the heat surpassed the highest temperature ever recorded by the station: 109 degrees on June 27, 2021.
Flames were fanned by erratic winds from thunderstorms that moved through the area overnight, Quintanilla said.
“The whole fire triangle is in effect — heat, fuels and wind,” she said.
Intense heat from the fire sent up a massive pyrocumulonimbus cloud that reached at least 39,000 feet into the sky, said Misty Firmin, meteorologist with the National Weather Service in Medford, Ore. These fire storm clouds can potentially produce lightning and strong, gusty winds, she said. When the cloud collapsed Friday night, an outflow of air kicked off an additional thunderstorm, she said.
Researchhas shownthat long-term warming has contributed to about half of the area burned in the Western United States over the last four decades, primarily by drying vegetation, said climate scientist Noah Diffenbaugh, a professor and senior fellow at Stanford University.
“We also know that in the shorter term, heat waves can really amplify those longer-term conditions and create very dry fuel conditions,” he said. “We’ve certainly seen that in recent large wildfires in California.”
Diffenbaugh’sresearch has foundthat a disproportionate fraction of the area burned by fire coincides with the most severe fire weather conditions, which take place when a moisture deficit, hot temperatures, low humidity and wind combine.
“Those days that have the most severe wildfire weather conditions are most responsible for larger fires,” he said.
Climate change is boosting the chances these conditions will align by increasing both mean temperatures and the frequency of severe heat waves, he said. Warming has alsoincreased the risk of severe droughtby causing more precipitation to fall as rain rather than snow and increasing the amount of moisture the atmosphere draws from plants and soils, he said.
While important, temperature is not the only influence on fire activity, he said. Land management decisions, vegetation type and condition and resources available to respond to a fire are also key. But if the planet continues to warm, more severe heat and an even greater frequency of extreme wildfire weather can be expected, he said.
The cause of the McKinney fire remained under investigation.
The National Weather Service issued a red-flag warning for the area  through Saturday, saying that scattered thunderstorms could result in abundant lightning striking critically dry vegetation. A fire weather watch is also in effect through Sunday.

Two California fires in the Sierra Nevada have very different outcomes. Why?,https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2022-07-30/why-two-california-wildfires-had-very-different-outcomes,2022-07-30,"The two fires started just 17 miles apart in the rugged terrain of California’s western Sierra Nevada — but their outcomes couldn’t have been more different.
The Washburn fire, which ignited July 7 along a forested trail in Yosemite National Park, was nearly contained, with no damage to structures or to the famed Mariposa Grove of giant sequoias.
But the Oak fire, which sparked almost two weeks later in the foothills near Midpines, confounded firefighters as it exploded to four times the size of Washburn and forced thousands to flee as it destroyed at least 106 homes. At times, the wildfire’s smoke plume could be seen from space.
Why was one fire so much more destructive?
Experts attribute the difference to variations in weather, vegetation and topography.  The management history of each landscape also played a role: Yosemite boasts decades of active stewardship, including prescribed burns,  while areas outside the park bear a legacy of industrial logging and fire suppression.
The Washburn fire started along a trail on the edge of the Mariposa Grove, just downhill from the road used by shuttle buses to ferry tourists from a parking lot.
Since vegetation along the trail was dense, and flames travel more quickly uphill, officials worried that the fire would grow hotter, gain speed and slam into the sequoia grove, said Yosemite Fire Chief Dan Buckley. That could result in a high-severity crown fire similar to  those that havedestroyed an estimated 20% of the world’s populationof the ancient giants since 2020, he said.
But luck was on the side of the fire officials: Two Yosemite battalion chiefs were teaching a chainsaw class to a sizable contingent of firefighters in the nearby Wawona area and were able to quickly respond, along with a water tender, two engines and the park’s water-dropping helicopter.
California
Crews scramble to protect giant sequoias in Yosemite’s Mariposa Grove as the Washburn fire burns 1,190 acres in the national park.
As the engines sprayed burning sequoias, park rangers enlisted civilian tour bus drivers to evacuate more than 450 visitors from the grove.
“They actually had to drive through flames on both sides of the road when they were taking these people out,” Buckley said. The rescue was completed in about 90 minutes,  allowing firefighters to focus on the flames, he said.
When the fire spread to the Mariposa Grove, it met a prescribed burn area that crews had treated in 2017, reducing the amount of brush and duff, or decaying vegetation, that would otherwise have helped the flames travel faster. Also, the winds picked up slightly and pushed flames away from the heart of the grove and downhill toward Wawona.
Those factors allowed firefighters to build a flanking line and steer flames around the grove, said Mike Theune, fire information officer for the National Park Service’s Pacific West region.
When the Oak fire startedthe afternoon of July 22in a patch of oak grassland, temperatures reached the 90s, and humidity was in the single digits. It took just 16 hours for the blaze to leapfrog the Washburn fire in size as it burned through steeper, less accessible, more populated terrain.
“The Oak fire started much lower in elevation. It’s much drier,” said Adrienne Freeman, fire information officer with the U.S. Forest Service. “And the key thing is it’s a different fuel type. There’s a heavy brush component.”
Parched brush and grass helped spread flames into stands of dense timber littered with conifers that had been killed by drought and bark beetles, Freeman said.
California
An increase in catastrophic wildfires has reduced California tree cover by 6.7% since 1985, and researchers fear the lost trees will never grow back.
California’s drought,which has been intensified by climate change, has killed upward of 100 million trees in the central and southern Sierra, said Scott Stephens, professor of fire science at UC Berkeley. Dead and fallen trees that are overgrown by shrubs burn extremely effectively. When enough ignite at once, they draw in oxygen that increases the burning rate, Stephens said. Researchers call this a “mass fire,” a term that was coined to describe the effects of incendiary bombing attacks in World War II, he said.
“It actually creates a localized low-pressure system,” he said.
Stephens was part of a team of researchers that documented this behavior in the 2020 Creek fire fora study published in May in Forest Ecology and Management. They found dead biomass, followed by live tree density, to be the two most important variables when it comes to predicting fire severity.
“Someone showed me a picture of the Oak fire, and it had a pyrocumulus cloud created above it at least 20,000 feet in height,” Stephens said. “That gets me wondering if we’re seeing similar behavior, at least in parts of that fire.”
The density of the vegetation is tied to the history of the land, which was logged starting in the mid-1800s.
“The Oak fire is burning in areas that have had big trees removed and lots of moderate and small trees brought in, and that homogeneity is going to make it worse,” Stephens said.
Also, Mariposa County is the ancestral home of the Southern Sierra Miwuk, who regularly set controlled fires — that is, until white settlers criminalized cultural burning. Its absence has upended the balance of the ecosystems, the Miwuk and fire scientists say. The area where the Oak fire began had not burned in nearly 100 years, according to fire history maps.
“This landscape here specifically needs healthy fire,” said Clay River, director of the Miwumati Healing Center, which serves as the hub for Miwuk health and social services.
After the Miwuk were violently evicted from Yosemite Valley for the formation of the national park, they were forcibly relocated to the foothills along what is now Highway 140, where the fire began, River said. Many are now watching their homes and cultural sites burn, she said.
California
As authorities began lifting evacuation orders, some Oak fire residents were learning whether they had homes to return to.
Acknowledging the benefits that cultural burning once offered to forest resilience, park officials have sought to bring low-intensity fire back to the landscape in the last 50 years. They have managed fires in the backcountry for resource benefits since 1972, resulting in a mosaic of small fire footprints that self-limit new starts, Buckley said. They have also performed a series of prescribed burns, including 22 in the Mariposa Grove alone.

Still, in the days that followed the Washburn fire’s initial advance, officials worried that it might circle back around and threaten the grove. The area contained dead trees and brush from a January 2020 wind event that blew down 28 mature giant sequoias and thousands of other trees.
But firefighters reported a major victory about three days into the fight, when they were able to hold the fire at Wawona Road to the west.
Officials credited a 2020 biomass removal project led by Garrett Dickman, a park forest ecologist, and the Mariposa County Resource Conservation District, with funding from a California Climate Investments grant. Teams removed close to 9,000 tons of vegetation along three miles of the road between Wawona and the Mariposa Grove, which they hope to follow with a series of prescribed fires, Dickman said.
When flames reached the site of the project, they dimmed and in some places extinguished, Dickman said. Firefighters were able to stand on the road and douse hot spots, freeing  up personnel to aggressively protect Wawona and the grove.
Some models indicated that had the fire launched embers over the road, it could have burned into Wawona, Fish Camp, Ponderosa Basin or Lushmeadows, Dickman said.
“It would have been a very, very, very different fire,” he said.

"Amid water restrictions, L.A. residents can get free recycled water for lawns",https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2022-07-28/la-residents-will-receive-free-recycled-water-to-irrigate-their-lawns-even-on-restricted-days,2022-07-28,"Angelenos can stock up again ongallons of recycled waterto irrigate their trees, plants and lawns — and free of charge through a Los Angeles Department of Water and Power program.
Mayor Eric Garcetti announced the reopening of two recycled water fill stations Thursday at the Los Angeles-Glendale Water Reclamation Plant and the L.A. Zoo parking lot.
The city’sResidential Recycled Water Fill Station Programwill offer up to 300 gallons of disinfected water per person per visit, the agency said. Participants can bring their own containers with water-tight lids to a water fill station. To qualify for the program, they must be an active customer with the Department of Water and Power, complete an application form and take training classes available at the sites.
“As we approach the hottest days of the year, we need to help Angelenos build on recent reductions to conserve even more — and that means providing real solutions, alternatives, and incentives to cut back on their water use,” Garcetti said in a statement.
Climate & Environment
Wildfires. Heat. Drought. Possible power shortages. The next month could be a tough one.
Recycled water will be available at the L.A.-Glendale Water Reclamation Plant every Thursday, Friday and Saturday between 8 a.m. and 3 p.m. Water can be filled at the zoo every Monday from 8 a.m. to 2 p.m.
“Recycled water is the definition of conservation,” said Councilmember Mitch O’Farrell, chair of the City Council’s Energy, Climate Change, Environmental Justice and L.A. River committee and whose 13th district comprises the L.A.-Glendale Water Reclamation Plant. “By offsetting demand for precious drinking water, this program will make recycled water more accessible for everyday Angelenos.”
The program first began in 2016 during the state’s ongoing battle with drought and was reinstated in 2017 and again in 2018, according to Jesus Gonzalez, manager of recycled water policy in LADWP’s Water Resources Group.
“We’re intending to keep this program on as long as we need to,” he said. “Through the summer and fall, it’ll be open. If we get a wet water year, then we’ll have to re-assess if it needs to remain but our intention is to keep it on as long as necessary.”
The agency is looking to expand the water recycling program and is working with the state for approval on additional fill stations through the city, specifically in the Valley and South L.A., Gonzalez said.
As California enters its third year of drought, grappling with a depleted water supply and thedriest water year in a century, the DWP reduced its three-day-a-week water rules, in place for customers since 2009, totwo days a weekbeginning in June. The restrictions apply to customers in the DWP’s coverage area.
Under the restrictions, residents were assigned two water days a week based on addresses. Those with odd addresses were assigned Monday and Friday while even addresses got Thursday and Sunday. Watering is limited eight minutes or 15 minutes for sprinklers with water-conserving nozzles. Watering isn’t permitted between 9 a.m. and 4 p.m. regardless of the day.
California
A state water board official has resigned, claiming the Newsom administration has “nearly eviscerated” the board’s ability to confront drought.
Violators of the restrictions will get a warning followed by fines for each subsequent violation, according to the agency.
The water cutbacks led to thelowest water use on recordfor June in the city’s history, Garcetti said. DWP customers used 9%  less water in June 2022 than they did in June 2021, according to preliminary data.
Now, customers will be able to use the recycled water stations on restricted days.
The program reflects a broader dedication to water conservation in the city. Years ago,Garcetti vowed to recycleall of the city’s wastewater by 2035.
The city and other agencies across Southern California are considering “direct potable use,” and putting purified recycled water back into drinking water systems.
The L.A.-Glendale Water Reclamation Plant has been producing recycled water for the past four decades for use by city parks, city departments and other private customers, including golf courses, Gonzalez said.
Officials are currently looking into ways of taking excess wastewater from the plant and treating it to higher qualify standards for potable re-use, Gonzalez said, adding that the state is expected to unveil regulations for potable use at the end of 2023.
“That will allow water purveyors and agencies to be able to implement technology to able to treat wastewater and to allow it to be part of its drinking water supply,” he said.
The DWP has to modernize its rates to match the rapidly changing electricity market and facilitate the transition to cleaner, greener energy.

7 enchanting places go forest bathing in Southern California,https://www.latimes.com/travel/newsletter/2022-07-28/forest-bathing-hiking-los-angeles-the-wild,2022-07-28,"Forest bathing, orshinrin-yoku, emerged in Japan in the 1980s as a form of nature therapy. How it works: You get out into a natural setting, mindfully observe your surroundings, and engage your senses. Basically, youslow down. A number ofresearch studiesrecognize the practice as a way to “reduce stress, improve mood andeven boost the immune system.” Times contributor Sara Cagleattended a forest bathing classat the L.A. County Arboretum and Botanic Garden (which is currently holdingguided full moon forest bathsthroughout the summer) and documented the experience.
“One person noticed the chirping of songbirds,” Cagle writes. “Another stared at the vibrant shades of green. One woman said she became so relaxed, she felt like she was shedding her first skin.”

Although guided classes are wonderful, forest bathing can be done in any natural setting, either with a group or alone. How should you go about it? There are no rules — simply turn off your devices and wander. Here are my seven favorite forest bathing spots in Southern California — with an optional hike to go with them.
1. Carbon Canyon Regional Park, Brea.Go for maximum shade for your summer forest bath under the redwoods via a2-mile loop in Orange County. Brea’s Carbon Canyon Regional Park is home to the largest grove of coastal redwoods in Southern California (241Sequoia sempervirensspecimens, to be exact), the tallest here being nearly 100 feet. Planted in the 1970s for a local bank promotion, the dense forest provides a 10-plus-degree temperature drop — perfect for  combating the summer heat and providing a magical space for your sensory experience.
Trailhead:Carbon Canyon Nature TrailAddress:4442 Carbon Canyon Road, BreaDistance:2-mile loopElevation:100 feetParking:dirt/paved lots ($3 weekdays, $5 weekends)
2. Wildwood Canyon State Park, Yucaipa.Coast live oaks might just be the arboreal mascot of Southern California. There are plenty of local spots to find varieties (certainly in our popular green-space trifecta of the Santa Monica Mountains, Griffith Park and Angeles National Forest), but opt for a less-traveled forest by way of a 2.25-mile stroll through Yucaipa’s Wildwood Canyon State Park. It may not surprise you to find fairy-tale-like groves of oak canopies along the Oak Tree Loop Trail, but a meditative meander in this forest is a one-of-a-kind bath.
Trailhead:Oak Tree LoopAddress:12241 Canyon Drive, YucaipaDistance:2.25-mile loopElevation:400 feetParking:dirt lot
3. Cooper Canyon Falls, Angeles National Forest.Enjoy a serene waterfall via a 3-mile out-and-back reflective romp on the Burkhart Trail deep in the San Gabriels. Starting fromBuckhorn Campground(which is a great spot to pitch a tent among the trees), the path parallels a quaint stream. And there are trees. Lots of trees. Moss-covered cedars, towering Jeffrey pines and iconic Douglas firs. Destinations are optional in forest bathing, but a good turnaround point is the eponymous cascade — although Cooper Canyon falls flow best after a rain, even a tranquil trickle adds an extra element of Zen to your trek.
Trailhead:Burkhart TrailAddress:Buckhorn Campground, PearblossomDistance:3-mile out-and-backElevation:750 feetParking:paved lot (Adventure Pass required)
4. Heaps Peak Arboretum, San Bernardino National Forest.The acreage is small but the restorative rewards are big on a 1-mile loop trail that features the Ann Henck Stewart Memorial Sequoia Grove, a SoCal rarity planted in the 1930s. Other trees to bathe under: Jeffrey pines, sugar pines, white fir, black oak, incense cedars and Coulter pines, which have the largest cones in the world (look for the educational display case for up-close viewing). Since Heaps Peak Arboretum is perched at 6,000 feet,check road conditionsbefore visiting.
Trailhead:Sequoia TrailAddress:29358 Rim of the World Highway #18, SkyforestDistance:1-mile loopElevation:100 feetParking:paved lot (Adventure Pass required)
5. Escondido Falls, Malibu.There’s no shortage of beautiful bark in the Malibu portion of the Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation Area. You can’t go wrong with any hike, but I like Escondido Falls for its quick access off PCH and an interesting element that might normally spurn forest bathers. The 3.75-mile out-and-back trek actually starts via a paved two-thirds-mile ascent through extravagant beach-view residences (after all, Escondido does mean “hidden”). But you won’t only be bathing in mansions. Once you reach the canyon trail, you’ll find sycamores, willows and oaks following a gentle stream. Your forest bathing terminus is a woodland grotto with 50-foot falls (please protect the habitat and don’t climb to the second tier). If all this makes you crave a rejuvenating swim, hop  PCH to a nearby beach.
Trailhead:Winding Way/Escondido Canyon TrailAddress:27200 Winding Way, MalibuDistance:3.75-mile out-and-backElevation:550 feetParking:Paved lot ($12) or street parking (free along PCH)
6. Elysian Park.Don’t dismiss the eucalyptus trees. Though these fast-growing, drought-tolerant gum trees are often considered an arboreal controversy in California, their grand and aromatic presence can provide a welcoming forest bath (think aromatherapy). In my humble opinion, Will Rogers State Historic Park has the most impressive grove of the flourishing non-natives, but opt for a forest bath in the heart of the urban jungle at our city’s oldest green space. The 2.5-mileWest Loophas eucalyptus but also towering palms, the hidden succulent treasures of Marian Harlow Memorial Grove and the Elysian Park Arboretum. Once filled with exotic trees, it is now an expansive picnic space, but look for interpretive signs detailing unique specimens like the naked coral tree.
Trailhead:West Loop TrailAddress:1025 Elysian Park Drive, Los AngelesDistance:2.5-mile loopElevation:250 feetParking:street parking
7. Point Fermin Park, San Pedro.Though I may stretch the term “forest” here, this coastal green-space gem has one of the most impressive arboreal collections in any city park. For a fig focus, try a beginner’s bathing course at San Pedro’s Point Fermin Park, which has nearly 20 absolutely massive Moreton Bay figs, all of which are perfect for a shaded picnic. For an urban stroll, consider a 2.5-mile park-to-park walk that features the giant banyans, panoramic coastal views along seaside cliffs, peregrine falcons and a bit of history (look for the nearby sunken city and the Korean Friendship Bell). Plus, neighboring Royal Palms beach features perhaps the best beachside palm grove in L.A.
Trailhead:Point Fermin ParkAddress:807 W. Paseo Del Mar, San PedroDistance:2.5-mile out-and-backElevation:100 feetParking:paved lot or street parking
Local gardens are also some of the most satisfying venues for your next forest bathing journey — think the aforementioned L.A. County Arboretum, theHuntington Library,Descanso Gardens,South Coast Botanic Gardenor theCalifornia Botanic Garden, all of which have an admission fee. Wherever you bathe, just remember to breathe and take in the natural beauty surrounding you.
1. Wish upon some stars (while learning about them too) at the Night Sky Festival in the Santa Monica Mountains.Enjoy some “nocturnal entertainment” (as Carl Sagan referred to stargazing) at National Park Service’sNight Sky Festivalon Saturday from 7 to 10 p.m. at Paramount Ranch.

Gabrielino Trail to Brown Mountain Dam.If you’re looking for a summertime shade-friendly hike in the Angeles National Forest, you’re likely to stumble across the popular trek throughBear Canyon to Switzer Falls. And for good reason! But this weekend, share the shade with fewer folks via the highly accessible Gabrielino Trail to Brown Mountain Dam. Featured in The Times’list of top 10 shaded hikes, it’s a 10-mile out-and-back adventure (roughly 900 feet of gain) from Hahamongna Watershed Natural Park (disc golf, anyone?) to the 1943 dam, which was the first project of the U.S. Forest Service Los Angeles River Watershed program. The relatively flat trail follows a quaint stream and meanders under the protection of oaks, pines, firs and walnut trees. The 81-foot falls still have water trickling down in the summer, perfect for a refreshing mid-hike cool-down and a picnic lunch. If you want a shorter (but arguably more challenging) workout, opt for a technical2.25-mile trip that switchbacks into the canyon.
In case you haven’t noticed, it’sfire season. Last week, I marveled at the incredible efforts of firefighters to save Yosemite’s Mariposa Grove of sequoias from theWashburn fire. However, since then, California has already experienced its largest burn of the season; the Oak fire, which started Friday in the Sierra Nevada foothills west of Yosemite National Park, has forced thousands to evacuate. Now, California Gavin Newsom has officiallydeclared a state of emergencyfor Mariposa County. With infernos like these and the huge current and future impacts of climate change, Times writer Alex Wigglesworth shares a grim reality: with fires as severe as these, some forestsmight vanish forever. Read Times reporterMadalyn Amato’s tips for wildfire preparationand keep an eye on our2022 wildfire map.
It’s official: Monarchs are endangered. Last week, the International Union for the Conservation of Naturemoved the beloved butterflies to the “red list”with its newfound threatened species classification. The royal pollinators are known for their incredible North American migration from Mexico to Canada and back (upwards of 3,000 miles!), the longest of any insects.Despite recent optimism, the rate of decline has surged (experts estimate “between 22% and 72% over 10 years, depending on the measurement method”), prompting environmental groups to push for protection under the Endangered Species Act. And let’s hope this comes soon — after all, their famous metamorphosis is an iconic symbol for change.
What can we do to help? Last year, Times writer Jeanette Marantos documentedsix ways to help the magical migrator, the most important being plantingnativemilkweed. We can also simplyobserve the winged wonders. Though not as abundant as during thefall-winter migratory period(October to February), butterfly-watchers can help gather data in ongoing conservation efforts this summer with theInternational Monarch Monitoring Blitzhappening July 29 through Aug. 7.
The best way to hike the Appalachian Trail this summer is in your backyard. With the most famous hiking route in America becomingincreasingly crowded, why not delay the bucket list adventure and walk the nearly 2,200 miles on your own terms, time and terrain? With theWalk the Distance app, hikers can track their miles as they virtually hike the AT, progressing along a map (you can also do the PCT!). Make it to Georgia’s Blood Mountain, the highest point on the journey, after a morning neighborhood stroll, or summit Mt. Katahdin, the trail’s north terminus, after bagging a peak in our resident San Gabriels. Doing the real thing can be a truly life-changing experience (as Times writer Ben Poston noted inhis beautiful, inspiring account), but sometimes we all need a little motivation to discover and appreciate our local trails and work toward those fitness goals we set last year.
Times writer Melissa Hernandez recently reported thata mountain lion was struck and killedalong the 101 Freeway, thesecond big cat to suffer a traffic tragedyin the Santa Monica Mountains in the last month. The recently deceased young cougar, P-89, was a 2-year-old male and one of many who regularly attempt to cross the busy freeway. In an effort to provide cougars and other animals safe passage, the Wallis Annenberg Wildlife Crossingbroke ground in April. The bridge is expected to be completed in 2025, but there’s more we can do. In fact, California senators will considerAB-2344next month; the Safe Roads and Wildlife Protection Act would require “Caltrans to identify potential wildlife barriers on all future transportation projects and implement at least 10 projects that improve wildlife crossings.” This would be a huge victory — after all, asThe Times Editorial Board noted: “Mountain lions may top the food chain in the wild, but on a road, the car is the apex predator.” To join the fight for protection, consider educating yourself with resources from theNational Park Service(and a visit to theSanta Monica Mountains National Recreation Area) or volunteering with local groups likeSave L.A. Cougarsand theCougar Conservancy.

"Oak fire near Yosemite grows to 19,000 acres, but firefighters are gaining upper hand",https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2022-07-28/oak-fire-behavior-increased-overnight-jumping-to-over-19-000-acres-burned-39-containment,2022-07-29,"Slow growth continued onthe Oak firenear Yosemite National Park on Thursday, with the blaze reaching 19,191 acres by nightfall as firefighters appeared to be gaining an upper hand.
The fire grew by a little more than 400 acres from the day before, officials said Thursday. It was the smallest daily growth so far for the Oak fire, which has been burning for six days, said California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection information officer David Clark.
Containment on the blaze rose to 42%, Cal Fire officials said Thursday night.
“Today was hotter and drier as expected, but cloud cover in the area prevented further drying and heating of fuels,” Cal Fire said. “Monsoonal moisture is expected to return early next week, which should lower temperature and raise humidity levels.”
The slowdown is a stark contrast to the fire’s first 24 hours, which saw explosive growth and extreme conditions turn the wildfire intoCalifornia’s largest of the season so far.
Most of the fire activity overnight from Wednesday to Thursday occurred on the northeastern perimeter of the fire.
California
As the sun rose over the Sierra Nevada foothills, it appeared burnt orange through hazy skies in Mariposa County.
“It’s growing in a very casual and gradual way,” Clark said of the fire. “We do have crews in place to mitigate any hot spots. Overall, we are expecting to see containment of the fire to increase and behaviors to stay the same.”
A total of 3,758 personnel are battling the fire, which has destroyed 135 structures and damaged 10 others, officials said. Nearly 700 structures remain threatened.
“We have a very inaccessible, steep, rocky terrain that the fire is growing in, and we’re having helicopters fly in,” Clark said. “We have to get crews there.”
Anair quality advisoryhas been extended through Thursday for communities in the San Francisco Bay Area. Winds are expected to continue pushing smoke from the fire site into the Bay Area, according to the Bay Area Air Quality Management District.
“The smoke is expected to remain aloft but may cause hazy skies across the Bay. Good to moderate air quality is forecast through the week,” the air district said.
California
As authorities began lifting evacuation orders, some Oak fire residents were learning whether they had homes to return to.
Theair quality indexin Mariposa County remained moderate Thursday evening. Elderly people and those with health issues are advised to stay indoors.
The Oak fire began Friday afternoon near Midpines, marking the start of the state’s peak wildfire season. The fire quickly exploded in size, causing Gov. Gavin Newsom todeclare a state of emergencyfor Mariposa County on Saturday.
A community meeting was scheduled for 7 p.m. Thursday at Mariposa County High School. Mariposa Elementary School is serving as a Red Cross evacuation center.

August is coming. Prepare for climate calamity,https://www.latimes.com/environment/newsletter/2022-07-28/august-is-coming-prepare-for-climate-calamity-boiling-point,2022-07-28,"This is the July 28, 2022, edition of Boiling Point, a weekly newsletter about climate change and the environment in California and the American West.Sign up hereto get it in your inbox.
Lake Siskiyou is beautiful this time of year.
About 200 miles north of Sacramento, the artificial reservoir — formed by a dam on the Sacramento River — is ringed by quiet beaches that offer a cool respite from triple-digit heat. The views of Mt. Shasta are spectacular. When I visited last week, I saw double-crested cormorants, ospreys and great blue herons soaring over the water and ducklings swimming with their mother.
It’s a great spot to take a few days off from work. It’s also not immune to the climate challenges confronting California and the American West as we enter August — a crucial month for water supplies, wildfires, extreme heat and possible power shortages.
I’m not trying to be a downer. As I’ve writtenagainandagain, there’s a lot that can be done to stem the climate crisis.
But the next month could offer a nasty reminder of why climate action is so badly needed.
Let’s start with the electric grid.It was two years ago this August that parts of the Golden State sufferedrolling blackouts— and we could be in store for more. Officials havewarnedof “a high degree of vulnerability” this summer as rising temperatures drive up air conditioning demand. The risk is especially bad on August and September evenings, after solar panels stop generating.
I asked Neil Millar, a vice president at the California Independent System Operator, about the odds of additional power shortfalls this summer. Not surprisingly, he wasn’t thrilled about the question, telling me it was like asking “how bad bad luck could get.”
“We’ve been in unprecedented times,” he said.
Overall, Millar was optimistic.He said the state has addedthousands of megawatts of batteriesthat can bank solar power for after dark, and has taken steps to secure other energy supplies —some of them polluting— that can keep the lights on in a pinch, even as they fuel the global warming that’s gotten us into this mess. A bunch of solar-plus-storage projects that officials feared would be delayed by supply-chain slowdowns or other economic disruptions ended up plugging into the grid on schedule.
But the Independent System Operator can’t guarantee the lights will stay on, especially if the weather gets crazy.
“We’re as well positioned as we could have hoped to be,” Millar said.
This isn’t just a California concern. Across the country, the risk of blackouts is frighteningly high as rising temperatures strain electric grids and coal and nuclear power plants shut down, as Alexander C. Kaufman reports in adetailed storyfor HuffPost.
Another part of the problem: Intense drought means there’s less water behind dams to spin turbines and generate hydropower. Just look at my colleague Myung J. Chun’sdramatic photos of Shasta Lake, where water levels fell to 38% of capacity last week.
California would  resort to intentional outages only to stave off a bigger electric-grid collapse. But shutting off anyone’s power during a heat wave is painful, and potentially lethal. As The Timeshas reported, extreme heat kills more Californians than officials have acknowledged, and global warming is making things worse — especially for people who can’t afford air conditioning.
Government agencies are trying to protect the most vulnerable. The Biden administration this week launchedheat.govto share tips on keeping cool and other information to help local officials deal with heat, as Lisa Friedmanreportsfor the New York Times. Closer to home, the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power is designing aprogramthat would help low-income and elderly customers — and people who depend on electricity for medical equipment — purchase air conditioning units at a low cost.
“Lives are at stake. Los Angeles residents’ health is at stake,” DWP board President Cynthia McClain-Hill said at Tuesday’s board of commissioners meeting. “That means people we know. It means members of our families, and our neighbors.”
None of those steps will eliminate the risks of heat illness or death. But they can definitely help — especially with Northern California in the grips of ascorching heat wave, and with the hottest part of the yearyet to comefor coastal Southern California.
Compared with extreme heat — which we can expect to get worse just about every year — wildfire is more of a wild card.So far in 2022, just 53,000 acres have burned in California — far below thefive-year averageof 415,000 acres by this point in July.
But we’re now entering one of the most dangerous times of year for fire activity, as heat dries out the already parched landscape. The Oak fire has quickly become the state’slargest blazeof 2022 since igniting Friday, burningmore than 18,000 acresnear Yosemite National Park and destroying 25 homes. Thousands of people have been forced to evacuate, with one resident of the Sierra Nevada foothills town of Midpinestelling my colleaguesthat as the fire blew up, “it looked like Godzilla over my house.”
Eighteen thousand acres isn’t much compared with therecord-breaking million acresconsumed by 2020’s August Complex fire — or last year’sDixie fire, which chewed through nearly as much ground. But the Oak fire would have been considered a big one just a few decades ago, according to UC Merced climatologist John Abatzoglou. And it could be a prelude to the rest of the year.
“There’s a lot more of the fire season yet to go, and things are really crispy out there,” Abatzoglou said.
When I asked Abatzoglou for his top three wildfire solutions, two of his answers involved more fire: setting“prescribed burns”to clear out vegetation in forests that have grown much too dense after a century of overly aggressive fire suppression, and allowing blazes in remote areas far from homes to burn themselves out — a strategy known as “managed fire.” He’d also like to see more robust funding for people to harden their homes against flames, and to clear excess vegetation from around their properties.
What about reducing climate pollution? It needs to happen, Abatzoglou said, but it’s not an immediate fire solution.
“Even though I’m a climate person, I know we’re not going to slow this down in the next 20 years too much,” he said.
As if wildfires weren’t scary enough on their own, they can also exacerbate power-grid problems. Utility companies sometimesshut off electricityduring high winds to stop their electric lines from sparking fires. Last summer, smoke from the Bootleg fire in southern Oregonknocked out several linesthat bring power to California, nearly leading to rolling blackouts here.
Then there’s the drought situation.If you haven’t heard,it’s bad— and August could bring more unwelcome news.
In the next few weeks, the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation will issue its latest forecast for water levels at the American West’s two largest reservoirs: Lake Mead and Lake Powell, which help supply tens of millions of people and millions of acres of farmland, from Los Angeles to Phoenix to Salt Lake City. The August forecast typically determines whether California, Arizona, Nevada and Mexico will see their Colorado River water deliveries reduced, as they were following last August’sfirst-ever shortage declaration.
Next month’s reservoir forecast will be grim — but that’s almost beside the point, says John Fleck, a Colorado River expert and writer in residence at the University of New Mexico School of Law’s Utton Transboundary Resources Center. That’s because in mid-June, the Bureau of Reclamation gave the seven Colorado River states60 daysto develop a plan to reduce water use dramatically — by 2 million to 4 million acre-feet next year. If they don’t make it happen, the federal agency couldorder draconian cutbacks.
Everyone will need to use less water, Fleck told me. But he suggested it will be especially important for wealthy cities to find ways to compensate rural, agriculture-dependent communities such asBlytheand theImperial Valleyfor cutting back.
“Climate change is coming in and taking their water. But we need to help them,” Fleck said.
So far, there are no real public signs a robust plan will come together. The river’s Upper Basin states — Colorado, New Mexico, Utah and Wyoming — havedeclinedto promise anything substantial, saying the onus should be on the Lower Basin states, per Luke Runyon at KUNC. And it’s unclear if California and the other Lower Basin states are having much success in agreeing on cutbacks.
Fleck said the most “politically expedient” path forward — especially in Arizona, where water cuts aredeeply unpopular— might be to punt to the federal government. He thinks that would be an unfortunate outcome, embracing conflict over cooperation.
“We’ve got to own up and take responsibility for the fact that this is all of our faults as water users,” Fleck said.
Meanwhile, water levels continue to fall. Lake Mead is at a record-low 27% of capacity — and if the numbers don’t do it for you, check out thesewild NASA satellite photosshowing how the desert reservoir has shrunk. Human remains were found on a Lake Mead beach this week as the water receded — thethird time that’s happened since May, my colleague Christian Martinez reports.
Just like with wildfire, slashing planet-warming emissions is not an immediate solution to the long-term drying trend in the American West.But without serious climate action, there’s also no way to avoid even worse catastrophe down the road.
It’s still possible the federal government will get its act together. Sen. Joe Manchin III of West Virginia — a Democrat who for months has blocked President Biden’s climate proposals —abruptly announcedlate Wednesday he’d struck a deal to support a sweeping bill focused on energy and climate, among other issues. The details were still coming into focus as of this writing, but here’s anearly summaryfrom my colleague Jennifer Haberkorn, who writes that the bill includes $369 billion for energy security and climate policies.
In California, Gov. Gavin Newsom is trying to step up on climate, even as hesupportsthe short-term use of fossil fuels to bolster power supplies. He sent aletterto state regulators last week asking them to plan for a gargantuan20 gigawattsof offshore wind power by 2045, and setting a target of 7 million “climate-ready and climate-friendly homes” by 2035. That could mean homes equipped withelectric heat pumpsinstead of polluting gas furnaces, and retrofitted to keep people cool during heat waves.
Newsom also asked state agencies to plan for a clean energy transition that includes no new natural gas plants — a big win for climate activists.The California Air Resources Board has recentlyprojecteda need for 10 gigawatts of new gas plants to help keep the lights on when solar panels and wind turbines aren’t generating, and to support electric-vehicle charging.
“This isn’t revolution. This should be the expectation,” said Alexandra Nagy, California director at the public affairs firm Sunstone Strategies, which works closely with environmental groups and has pushed Newsom to take bolder action on climate.
It was hard for me not to think about this stuff last week, even as I relaxed on the shore of Lake Siskiyou.Had drought reduced hydropower production at Box Canyon Dam, which I glimpsed while hiking around the reservoir? How much cooler would it be if the planet hadn’t already warmed up so much? Would I see more birds? Would there bemore snowpack on Mt. Shasta?
I don’t have good answers to those questions. I do recommend the occasional vacation, though. We all deserve a break.
Here’s what else is happening around the West:
California is making plans to rely on carbon capture — at least a little bit — to meet its climate goals.But environmental critics say the technology would extend the state’s reliance on fossil fuels andcontinue a harmful legacy of pollutionin low-income neighborhoods, my colleague Tony Briscoe writes. The state’s Air Resources Board is gearing up to finalize its all-important climate “scoping plan” this fall, so look out for more news on this front. In another key political development, Gov. Gavin Newsom is opposing a Lyft-backed ballot measure that would tax multimillionaires and put the money toward electric car rebates and wildfire prevention, calling Proposition 30 “a special interest carve-out.”Details herefrom the Sacramento Bee’s Owen Tucker-Smith.
It took three years, but the Newsom administration has new details on a proposed delta tunnel to move Sacramento River water to Southern California and the San Joaquin Valley.The latest iteration of this massive infrastructure project — first proposed many decades ago — would skirt under the eastern edge of the ecologically fragile estuary where the Sacramento and San Joaquin rivers meet, rather than under the delta’s heart, Dale Kasler and Ryan Sabalowreport for the Sacramento Bee. But the project still has many critics, and it’s unclear whether the tunnel will ever get built. Construction wouldn’t start until 2028.
Reuters published a powerful investigation of the radioactive contamination from Santa Susana Field Lab just outside L.A. — and Boeing’s use of a “conservation easement,” which critics see as an increasingly common tool for companies to limit their toxic waste cleanup responsibility.Here’s the storyfrom reporters Jaimi Dowdell and Andrea Januta. See alsothis Arizona Republic pieceby Zayna Syed about the lack of funding for cleaning up hundreds of abandoned uranium mines on the Navajo Nation, andthis High Country News pieceby Jonathan Thompson about oil companies evading cleanup obligations in New Mexico.
One of Mexico’s wealthiest cities has so little water that many residents — especially the poor — get nothing when they turn on their taps.What’s happening in Monterrey is awarning for the Western U.S., my colleague Kate Linthicum writes. It’s a warning at least some places are taking seriously. California is finalizing rules for “direct potable reuse” — purifying wastewater and putting it right back into the tap — and L.A. could bethe first city to actually do it, The Times’ Jaimie Ding reports. Las Vegas islimiting the sizeof new residential swimming pools, per Grace Da Rocha at the Las Vegas Sun. And many individuals continue to do their part — including one Pasadena residentembracing “hugelkultur”to reduce her water use, as Jeanette Marantos writes.
Could robots picking indoor crops keep food production humming even as rising temperatures, water shortages and chemical regulation slam traditional agriculture?Here’s thefascinating storyby my colleague Sam Dean, focused on the California strawberry industry. I hadn’t realized 90% of the nation’s strawberries are grown along the California coast, which is pretty cool. In other agriculture news, ranchers say cattle grazing in the West is crucial for the health of the land — but there’sa lot of science showing otherwise, including serious climate damage. Thanks to Georgina Gustin at Inside Climate News for the story.
How did California go from paying hunters to destroy mountain lions to spending millions protecting them?The Times’ Patt Morrisontraced the history, from some ugly L.A. Times coverage a century ago, to the role of Ronald Reagan in reining in hunting, to the ballot measure that ultimately created funding to buy habitat for the majestic beasts. (Another mountain lion waskilled on the 101 Freewaylast week, marking four of them killed by cars in Southern California this year.) In other Western wildlife news, the International Union for Conservation of Nature has determined monarch butterflies are at risk of extinction — but the U.S. still hasn’t given the migrating insects endangered species protections.Details herefrom Christina Larson at the Associated Press.
“We have set the precedent, and it is the pursuit of justice.”For the first time ever, government has returned land that was wrongfully taken from a Black family — and it’s right on the California coast. My colleague Rosanna Xiawrote about the heartfelt ceremonyin which the Bruce family took ownership of Bruce’s Beach. “Today, we’re sending a message to every government in this nation confronted with the same challenge: This work is no longer unprecedented,” L.A. County Supervisor Janice Hahn said.
Nonprofit news outlet Floodlight and the Orlando Sentinel have several new entries in their eye-popping investigation into Florida Power & Light, a subsidiary of NextEra Energy, the nation’s largest power company.First, Floodlight’s Mario Alejandro Ariza and the Sentinel’s Annie Martin reported that operatives working for the Florida utilitygained control over a political news websiteand influenced coverage to try to benefit the company. Next, the journalistsrevealedthat NextEra consultant Matrix LLC — which has been described as “the closest thing Alabama politics has to a non-governmental secret agency” — has worked on campaigns not only for NextEra but also for power companies as far away as Arizona. (Floodlight’s Miranda Green also  co-wrote that story.)
A bill sailing through the California Legislature would task state officials with estimating the carbon emissions intensity of oil tanked in from overseas.At least one climate-friendly lawmaker supports the legislation. But it’s also backed by the oil industry, and environmental critics suspect the data would be used topromote in-state drilling, Aaron Cantu reports for Capital & Main.
Ford has signed a binding agreement to buy lithium for electric car batteries from the proposed Rhyolite Ridge mine in Nevada.It’s part of a growing effort by the U.S. auto industry tosource lithium domestically, from spots such as northern Nevada andCalifornia’s Salton Sea, Reuters’ Ernest Scheyder reports — a priority for car companies in part due toforced-labor concernsat Chinese lithium mines. But the domestic lithium push faces a backlash from some conservationists. The Associated Press’ Scott Sonner wrote about theenvironmental challengesslowing down lithium mining and geothermal energy projects in Nevada.
In related news, Kansas is getting the largest economic development project in its history — a $4-billion Panasonic lithium-ion battery factory that will rival Tesla’s Nevada Gigafactory in scale.Here’s the storyfrom Canary Media’s Shel Evergreen.
There’s still no word on when the California Public Utilities Commission might propose new rooftop solar incentive rates, six months after Newsom basically rejected its previous proposal.That didn’t stop protesters from gathering at Sempra Energy headquarters tovoice their displeasurewith the company, whose San Diego Gas & Electric subsidiary has pushed for lower incentives, as the San Diego Union-Tribune’s Rob Nikolewski reports. Stay tuned as I continue to track this story.
The writer Mike Davis is legendary for chronicling the story of Los Angeles, most notably in the 1990 book “City of Quartz.” He’s also known as a “prophet of doom.” He famously foretold environmental disaster in another tome, “Ecology of Fear.”
Now he’s dying of esophageal cancer — and as much as he sees climate nightmares on the horizon, he’s also got ideas for how people can demand change. As hetold my colleague Sam Dean: “We’ve forgotten the use of disciplined, aggressive but nonviolent civil disobedience. Take climate change. We should be sitting in at the headquarters of every oil company every day of the week. You could easily put together a national campaign. You have tons of people who are willing to get arrested, who are so up to do it.”

The Jan. 6 hearings aren’t playing the way Democrats hope in one California swing district,https://www.latimes.com/politics/story/2022-07-28/jan-6-hearings-reinforce-views-in-california-battleground,2022-07-28,"CERES, Calif. —Even before the House committee investigating the Jan. 6 insurrection called a single witness, Amador Martinez had seen enough.
“It’s on him,” he said of former President Trump, who capped his efforts to overturn the 2020 electionby siccing an angry and vengeful mob on the Capitol. “One hundred and ten percent.”
Melody Douglas also made up her mind long beforethe first hearing was gaveled open in TV’s prime time.
“It’s a sham,” she said of the committee and its work. “It’s just an effort to make Trump look bad. Hopefully, he’s holding his head high.”
The Select Committee to Investigate the January 6th Attack on the United States Capitol, as the panel is called, has offered a riveting account of apower-mad president and the crises his ego and insecurities foisted on the country.
Its public hearings, in eight installments, have drawn millions of viewers, offered a strong case for Trump’s criminal prosecution and illustrated in lurid detail — f-bombs, thrown tableware, abuse of Secret Service agents — the pathology of the president and his hissy fits.
Cassidy Hutchinson’s Jan. 6 hearing testimony underscores why Trump should never get near the White House again.
What the hearings have apparently failed to do, at least so far, is change a great many minds or alter the way voters seem to be approaching November’s midterm elections.
For Caitlyn Miller, the committee’s findings merely reinforce what she believed all along, that Trump did nothing to stop the violence and will probably get away with his sordid behavior, along withRepublicans who aided and abetted his attempt at a coup.
“It’s kind of annoying to listen and watch and read how s— everyone was,” said Miller, 30, an office worker in Modesto, “and then to think no one’s going to be held responsible.”
Her focus this election is on other issues where, the Democrat believes, her vote could make a difference: climate change, abortion rights and seeing that the Supreme Court doesn’t roll back other personal freedoms, like same-sex marriage.
“I donotwant to see Republicans in control,” Miller said emphatically, thrusting her arms out as though she could personally shove HouseGOP leader Kevin McCarthyaway from the speakership.
Nationwide, there are relatively few House races that are genuine toss-ups; perhaps three dozen or so.
One of them is here in the Central Valley, where Democrat Adam Gray and Republican John Duarte are vying to represent a newly created district sprawling south from the outskirts of the Bay Area.
The 13th Congressional District is mostly rural — two-lane highways, farm stands, feedlots, endless orchards — save for a slice of Modesto, its next-door neighbor, Ceres, and Turlock.
With the temperature topping 100 degrees this week and the sky mottled with smoke from yet another Yosemite wildfire, the doings of lawmakers in Washington seemed quite remote. In interviews across the district, voters talked about inflation, drought, homelessness, water, the resurgence of COVID-19 and,especially, high gas prices.
“There are a lot of other things going on in the world,” said Sharon D., a 50-year-old Trump voter and mental health clinician in Ceres, who called the investigation into the Jan. 6 violence and its roots a waste of time and money. (She asked not to use her last name, to avoid harassment.) “Nobody cares anymore.”
Unless something dramatically changes afterthecommittee resumes its hearings in September, the insurrection probably won’t play much of a role in deciding who wins the open congressional seat.
Democrats praised Gray, a 44-year-old state assemblyman, for his work in Sacramento. Republicans said Duarte, a 55-year-old farmer who also helps run a family-owned nursery, is the perfect fit for this agriculture-dependent district.
Most people were like Douglas and Martinez, who didn’t connect Jan. 6 to the local contest and aren’t about to be swayed no matter what the committee finds.
Douglas, a 60-year-old Republican homemaker in Empire, considers Trump “the best president we’ve had in a long time” and hopes he runs again in 2024.
She firmly believes the 2020 election was stolen and the rioters who overran the Capitol were undercover leftists who set out to incriminate the former president. Nothing and no one — certainly not the Democrats and two Republicans, Liz Cheney and Adam Kitzinger, on the committee — can convince her otherwise.
In fact, she hasn’t bothered to watch a minute of the hearings, Douglas said, and why should she? In her eyes everyone in Washington is corrupt and needs to go.
“Start again with honest people,” Douglas said, “like it was back in 1776.”
Martinez, who stopped by the post office in Ceres moments after Douglas left, had a word for people like her. “I think they’ve been manipulated,” he said.
“I knew something was wrong when Trump said he could kill someone on Main Street and get away with it,” Martinez went on. (Actually, Trump said he could shoot someone on Fifth Avenue and get away with it, which he undoubtedly would with some of his more fanatic supporters.) “I thought, ‘Oh, my God. It’s bad.’”
The 55-year-old landscaping contractor, a Ceres Democrat, said he has closely followed the hearings and believes it was every citizen’s duty to do so.
“We need people to take responsibility,” Martinez said of the assault on the Capitol and, more, democracy itself.
In a red-versus-blue world where some refuse to acknowledge even basic facts, it’s hardly surprising to find partisans dug into their positions, or ignoring evidence contrary to what they choose to believe.
But engagement and persuasion are just two measures of the committee’s success, and hardly the most important.
A president flagrantly abused his power and coaxed supporters not only to invade the Capitol but lay siege to one of the country’s most important and sacred principles, the peaceful transfer of power.
He continues to lie about it and must be held to account.
Outside the public library in Patterson, a small farm town, Gail Tallman paused to state her support for the Jan. 6 hearings.
Voters in the Central Valley talk about Jan. 6 and their top issues in November’s midterm election.
“I’ve seen every one of them,” said the 66-year-old elementary school teacher, a Democrat and Navy veteran. “It’s actually made me angrier.”
No matter the television ratings, the number of people who come away with a different perspective, or the result of the valley’s closely fought congressional race, Tallman succinctly summarized why the hearings are so vitally important.
No one, she said, is above the law.

"Wildfire roars past 4,200 acres, injures 2 and destroys at least 4 structures in San Diego County",https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2022-08-31/brush-fire-threatens-homes-near-border-in-san-diego-county,2022-09-01,"SAN DIEGO COUNTY —A fast-moving wildfire in a rural part of east San Diego County grew to 4,243 acres by Wednesday night, ripping through bone-dry brush, injuring two people and destroying at least four buildings as the region baked under extreme heat.
Residents around Barrett Junction, a few miles northwest of Tecate, Mexico, scrambled to clear out after the fire erupted around 2:15 p.m. near Barrett Lake Road north of State Route 94.
By late Wednesday night, the blaze was 5% contained as it continued to rage, threatening the communities of Barrett, Potrero and Tecate, according to the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection.
Smoke could be seen for miles.
Apolonio Gilbert said he was working in the Barrett Lake Mobile Home Park when he saw flames and smoke in a nearby canyon. Gilbert, 62, jumped into his truck and drove around the park, honking and warning people to get out. He and his wife grabbed their three dogs and fled.
The fire burned through the park, but no homes there were lost.
California
The Route fire has prompted expanded evacuation orders covering a mobile home park, a school and other structures amid triple-digit heat.
In the early hours of the fire, moderate winds fanned it eastward along the highway. Gusts reached 27 mph.
By 6 p.m., the fire jumped to the south side of State Route 94 and burned “very aggressively” in the direction of Tecate and Potrero, Cal Fire San Diego Capt. Thomas Shoots said.
“The winds have died down, but the fire remains very active,” he said just before 8 p.m.
Shoots said there were “multiple close calls” as residents rushed to evacuate. At least four structures, including at least one home, were destroyed, Shoots said.
“We had multiple 911 calls from folks unable to evacuate” because their homes were surrounded by the fire, Shoots said.
Two people suffered burns and were taken to hospitals. One was taken by ground. The other was flown in an air ambulance.
Nearly 600 people were ordered to evacuate, and almost 800 others were given evacuation warnings. More than 300 customers lost power.
Mobile home park resident Martin Ledezma was at work when his mother called to tell him about the fire. He drove home, grabbed some belongings and started to flee, but he stopped to help fire crews, using a shovel to help tamp down flames.
The park is a small community, he said, while he was covered in sweat and ash. “If one of us burns, we all burn.”
California
State officials are asking Californians to voluntarily limit electricity use Wednesday from 4 to 9 p.m. as the year’s worst heat wave begins. Temperatures in the 100s are expected across large swaths of the state through Tuesday.
The fire broke out as an extreme heat wave grips the Western states and California’s electrical grid operatorcalled for consumers to cut energy use. Camporeached a blistering 105, tying a record high for that date, according to the National Weather Service. The heat will continue into next week.
The blaze was reported around 2:15 p.m. near Barrett Lake Road north of State Route 94, Shoots said. By 4:45 p.m. it had roared past 1,400 acres as it pushed northeast toward the community of Potrero.
As the fire started to spread, the flames were racing toward homes in the Round Potrero Road area, Shoots said. Evacuations were ordered for residences along Barrett Lake Road, Coyote Holler Road and Round Potrero Road, according to Shoots andthe San Diego County Sheriff’s Department.
José Lopez and his wife were watching television inside their mobile home when they got alerts on their cellphones warning them to evacuate.
“We started preparing clothes and documents and things,” Lopez said. “Then the sheriff’s [deputies] began going through the park and saying, ‘You need to evacuate immediately.’”
As the couple drove away from the mobile home park, he said, the flames were coming down a hill toward it. He didn’t know whether his home would survive.
“It is what it is, you hope for the best,” said Lopez, who added that the flames had burned all the way to the edge of Barrett Lake Road as they fled.
Lopez’s wife went to an evacuation center at Jamul Casino, but Lopez stayed at a dirt lot on the corner down the road from the fire, hoping he’d be able to get home earlier.
David Galván lives about two miles up Barrett Lake Road off State Route 94 and said he waited until the last minute to evacuate with his dog Jack, who had crawled under Galván’s pickup. Galván, who works as a handyman, sprayed the roof of his home before he left.
“You could hardly breathe,” Galván said, his eyes still puffy and moist from inhaling the smoke a few hours earlier.
As neighbors who live along Barrett Lake Road — most of them from the Barrett Lake Mobile Home Park — gathered at the corner where their street meets State Route 94, a Cal Fire firefighter approached and told them it would be a “day or two” until they’d be able to go back home.
“It’s not over, but we’re doing well up there,” said the firefighter, who declined to give his name. The fire “was not over, but it has burned through, and there could be embers, but all the trailers were saved.”
California
The high-pressure system over most of California is expected to bring record-breaking temperatures, part of a “self-perpetuating” system that is becoming more extreme as climate change worsens.
Crews attacked the flames from the air and from the ground. “We’ve requested every wildland engine from Cal Fire in San Diego County,” Shoots said.
By 5:30 p.m., more than 200 firefighters were battling the fire and “many more” were en route, Shoots said. Six air tankers, seven helicopters and several fixed-wing aircraft have been deployed, he said. None of the aircraft was equipped to fly at night, but firefighters will remain on the ground overnight to protect structures.
Authorities shut down the U.S.-Mexico border crossing in Tecate, and State Route 94, also known as Campo Road,is closedessentially from Campo to Dulzura. Barrett School Road is closed at State Route 94.
Caltrans San Diego said it was unknown when the highway would reopen.
The Sheriff’s Department said a temporary evacuation point was being set up at Jamul Casino on Campo Road south of Lyons Valley Road, to the west of the fire.
A second evacuation point was set up at Camp Lockett Event & Equestrian Facility at 799 Forrest Gate Road in Campo. The site is accepting large animals.
Families with pets and large animals can go to the San Diego County Animal Shelter at 5821 Sweetwater Road in Bonita.

"Route fire near Castaic explodes to 5,100 acres; 8 firefighters suffer heat-related injuries",https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2022-08-31/fire-5-freeway-castaic-route-fire,2022-09-01,"A wildfire near Castaic quickly exploded in size prompting mandatory evacuations and temporarily closing all lanes of the 5 Freeway as Southern California sweltered under triple-digit temperatures.
The Route fire, which was first reported just after noon along the freeway near Lake Hughes Road, had grown to 5,100 acres by Thursday and was 0% contained.
About 250 county firefighters were assigned to the blaze along with 115 U.S. Forest Service firefighters, eight air tankers and seven helicopters, said L.A. County Fire Inspector Craig Little.
California
California officials have extended a Flex Alert into Friday, and triple-digit heat at a fire near Castaic forced officials to pull back some firefighters on the front lines.
No structures were threatened Wednesday night, L.A. County Fire Capt. Sheila Kelliher said.
The intense blaze spurred evacuations as crews contended with hot, dry and windy conditions on the first day of what’s expected to bea brutal weeklong heat wave.
By Wednesday night, evacuations south of Northlake Hills Elementary School were lifted, according to the L.A. County Sheriff’s Department. Evacuation orders remained in place north of the school, south of Templin Highway — including the Paradise Ranch Estates mobile home park — east of the 5 and west of Castaic Lagoon.
The Route fire has prompted evacuations for a mobile home park, school and other structures amid triple-digit heat.
Northlake Hills Elementary School, located between the 5 and Ridge Route Road, was evacuated earlier Wednesday; the Sheriff’s Department said all Northlake Hills staff and students were safe. In a message posted to Twitter, the school’s principal said the campus would be closed Thursday.
Between 100 and 200 homes have been evacuated so far, said Sheriff’s Lt. Brandon Barclay.
Eight firefighters, six of whom were transported to a hospital, suffered minor to moderate heat-related injuries, Little said.
The blaze was being driven by fuels parched by years of drought, he said.
Temperatures in the area reached nearly 110 degrees by midday with 12% humidity, according to the National Weather Service.
Footage from KTLA-TV Channel 5 showed flames on both sides of the southbound lanes with smoke rising from rolling, dry hills. The southbound and northbound lanes are separated by a large hill.
California
State officials are asking Californians to voluntarily limit electricity use Wednesday from 4 to 9 p.m. as the year’s worst heat wave begins. Temperatures in the 100s are expected across large swaths of the state through Tuesday.
A large tanker could be seen dropping fire retardant along the fire line.
About two hours after the Route fire broke out, a fast-moving blaze was reported near the U.S.-Mexico border in east San Diego County.
By Wednesday night, the fire hadgrown to more than 4,200 acres, destroyed at least four structures, including at least one home, and was threatening others.
Two people suffered burns and were taken to hospitals. California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection San Diego Capt. Thomas Shoots said there were “multiple close calls” as residents rushed to evacuate their homes.
“We had multiple 911 calls from folks unable to evacuate” because their homes were surrounded by the fire, Shoots said.

“We’ve requested every wildland engine from Cal Fire in San Diego County,” Shoots said.
The fire led authorities to close the U.S.-Mexico border crossing in Tecate, and State Route 94 was closed essentially from Campo to Dulzura. The blaze was 5% contained late Wednesday as firefighters continued to battle to protect homes.

"Extreme heat wave pushing California power grid to limit, with rolling blackouts possible",https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2022-08-31/california-heat-wave-likely-to-spur-flex-alerts-for-energy-grid,2022-09-01,"The worst heat wave of the year is presenting a critical test for California’s overtaxed power grid, with officials warning rolling blackouts are possible without major conservation efforts during a week of scorching temperatures.
Extreme heat is expected to grip the vast majority of California for at least six days, perhaps even longer.
Authorities are worried about power capacity in part because high temperatures are forecast not just across inland regions that typically broil this time of year, but also along many parts of the  coast. That could mean many more people reaching for the air conditioning during peak hours.
“We are anticipating this extreme heat to be a length and duration the likes of which we haven’t experienced in some time,” Gov. Gavin Newsom said Wednesday in urging residents to conserve power.
Climate & Environment
When there’s a risk of a blackout, how do you prepare? And what should you do — and not do — when one is happening and after it’s over?
Temperatures could hit all-time and monthly record highs, and are expected to be 10 to 20 degrees above average during the day with little relief expected come evening. High temperatures could hit  124 degrees in Death Valley.
“We’re not super confident on when it’s going to end,” Bill Rasch,  a meteorologist with the National Weather Service, said of the heat wave.
Climate & Environment
Utilities have funds available to install air conditioning in low-income households, but for one California family, help did not come soon enough.
Officials are asking Californians to limit electricity use when possible to minimize strain on the state’s energy providers, otherwise risking those rolling blackouts. Losing power during such extreme heatcan behighly dangerous, if not deadly, especially for the most vulnerable.
California officials on Wednesdayissued the first statewide Flex Alertduring this heat wave, as most of the state entered its first day of extreme heat in this wave. Asecond Flex Alertwas issued for Thursday.
During a Flex Alert, consumers are urged to reduce their energy use in the afternoon and evening hours, when the grid is most stressed because of high demand and less available energy from solar panels.
A#FlexAlertis in effect for today, Aug. 31 from 4 p.m. to 9 p.m. Help us reduce stress on the power grid by flexing your power with some of these tips.pic.twitter.com/q5peG1tS2S
Newsom declared a state of emergency Wednesday following a request from the California Independent System Operator, which operates the state’s power grid, intended to temporarily increase energy production and response systems during the intense period of extreme heat.
“This is going to be a sustained event that’s going to take sustained focus and sustained participation,” said Elliot Mainzer, president of Cal ISO.
California
From Wednesday through Labor Day weekend, weather forecasters predict temperatures could reach as high as 115 degrees in some parts of Southern California.
The governor’s Office of Emergency Services is tracking cooling centers across the state, and they will continue to expand as the heat event continues, officials said.  The office also has generators and rapid response fire teams ready for deployment to communities in need, as the chance for wildfires increases. Officials are preparing for Sunday, Monday and Tuesday to see the highest electricity demands this year— likely above 48,000 megawatts.
California
The high-pressure system over most of California is expected to bring record-breaking temperatures, part of a “self-perpetuating” system that is becoming more extreme as climate change worsens.
Mark Ghilarducci, director of the office, said the situation is constantly changing.
“It will continue to unfold and look differently across the state in the coming days,” he said.
Despite government projects and efforts to bring more capacity online, the power system remains especially vulnerable because neighboring areas from where California imports energy are also experiencing the crushing conditions. The ongoing drought further strains the energy grid by reducing hydropower supply sources, officials said, along with a small number of plants that have gone offline in recent years.
Siva Gunda, vice chair for the California Energy Commission, said the state has been working to bring more supplies online, including through more projects, and shore up energy reserves.

Newsom advised Californians to turn their thermostats up to 78 degrees during the Flex Alert from 4 to 9 p.m. Wednesday. The governor warned that Sunday and Monday will be the most challenging days for the energy grid.
The high temperatures hit as the governor and his team pressure lawmakers to pass a bill on the final day of the legislative year to keep the Diablo Canyon nuclear plant open until 2035.
The plant, which sits on the coast of San Luis Obispo County and generated 6% of the electricity in the state last year, is slated to close in 2025.
Newsom argues Diablo must stay open for California to keep the lights on during heat waves and avoid a repeat of the rolling blackouts the state experienced two years ago. Environmental groups that pushed six years ago for the closure of Diablo strongly oppose.
The heat wave began Wednesday with  daily heat records in some parts of Southern California.
Woodland Hills reached 112 degrees, breaking the previous record of 111 degrees for Aug. 31 set in 1998. Burbank’s high of 112 broke the previous daily record of 108 degrees set in 2017, and Sandberg reached 100 degrees, exceeding the previous high of 98 degrees, also in 2017.
112° at#Burbank@fly_BURsets a new monthly record for August. The old record was 111° last set on August 26, 1944.  For those keeping score, the all-time high temp record is 114° last set on 9/6/2020, 9/5/2020, and 7/6/2018.#LAHeat#CAwxhttps://t.co/BbZo7jwH2e
And it’s just the beginning for the Labor Day weekend and beyond.
Temperatures along the coasts could range from 80 to 95 degrees Wednesday through Saturday, before increasing to 100 degrees Sunday and Monday, the weather service said.
The valleys and mountains could be pummeled by 95- to 110-degree temperatures Wednesday through Saturday, and highs of up to 115 Sunday and Monday, meteorologists said.
“This is not a normal heat wave,” meteorologist Trevor Boucher with the National Weather Service in Las Vegas said.

California heat waves are getting worse. Blame the vicious ‘heat dome’,https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2022-08-31/the-heat-dome-phenomenon-thats-generating-californias-hottest-week-and-why-its-getting-worse,2022-08-31,"The high-pressure system over most of California is expected to bring record-breaking temperatures, part of a “self-perpetuating” system that is becoming more extreme as climate change worsens.
The extreme temperatures that will bear down on California over the next week are the result of a “heat dome,” a phenomenon that typically brings broiling conditions to the state as summer fades into fall. But climate change is worsening the dome’s effects and making it more lethal for people who cannot seek relief.
Experts are sounding alarms about what they say is likely to be the worst heat wave of the year so far.
“We’ve always had these systems, but not as frequently, not as intense and not as long-lasting,” said Bill Patzert, a retired climatologist in the Los Angeles area.
California
Forecasters say the Antelope Valley could see temperatures as high as 113 degrees during the ongoing heat wave.
From San Diego to Sacramento, the National Weather Service has issued an excessive heat warning or watch through Labor Day, cautioning about thehealth risksof sustained high temperatures. Experts say the heat wave will also increase the chance of wildfires and power outages and will exacerbate the state’s ongoing drought.
“This is going to be a long-duration event,” said UCLA climate scientist Daniel Swain. “And that’s sort of characteristic of heat domes — that’s partly because they can sort of be self-persisting, self-reinforcing. Once they develop and become particularly extreme, they kind of become hard to dislodge.”
Swain said “heat dome” is a colloquial term for “a particularly persistent and strong region of atmospheric high pressure during the warm months.”
When the high-pressure system moves into an area under certain conditions, it traps heat, similar to an insulated dome. This is what will bring extreme temperatures this week across California and Nevada.
“When you’re inside of a high-pressure system, particularly a strong one, you generally have downward motion in the atmosphere, as opposed to upward motion ... and that suppresses clouds,” Swain said. “It results in clear skies, so you get more solar radiation, more warming of the surface.
California needs to start treating extreme heat like the public health hazard it is.
“But beyond that ... you get additional warming, because that downward motion itself results in compressional heating.”
He called those simultaneous effects the “vicious-cycle feedbacks” of the heat dome: the heat dries out the soil, which eliminates atmospheric moisture, which allows the sun to more easily heat the Earth’s surface and so on.
“You can kind of see how that becomes self-perpetuating,” Swain said. “And that’s what we’re going to see this week into next week over California and Nevada. We’re going to see this persistent high-pressure system — this is a pretty extreme heat dome — that’s going to accumulate more and more heat as it persists through those processes.”
California
From Wednesday through Labor Day weekend, weather forecasters predict temperatures could reach as high as 115 degrees in some parts of Southern California.
Heat waves are becomingmore deadly and more common across the Golden State. Arecent study analyzing data from 1950 to 2020found that heat waves in Southern California were “starting earlier and ending later in the year for urban regions,” a trend that is “linked to human-induced climate change.”
Glynn Hulley, a research scientist at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory who led that study, said his team found that heat waves have become “more frequent, intense and longer-lasting.” He said this week’s heat wave  fits into the “more intense” category, with record-breaking temperatures expected.
California
Experts remind Southern California residents to stay hydrated, stay out of the direct sun and shelter in air conditioned buildings, if possible.
“It’s the intensity of this one that does fit in with with the trends we see,” Hulley said.
While climate change isn’t causing heat domes, he said, the contributing factors — like extreme drought and a warmer atmosphere — make the effect more extreme.
“Every year, we tend to break more and more records — not just in Los Angeles but across the planet,” Patzert said. “I no longer call it global warming; I call it global heating.”
The National Weather Service predicts that from Wednesday through Labor Day weekend, temperatures could reach as high as 115 degrees in parts of Southern California. It will be the region’s longest and most intense heat wave of the year, said David Sweet, a meteorologist at the National Weather Service in Oxnard. The conditions are expected to last through Monday, though “we don’t see an end to it right now,” Sweet said.
An excessive heat warningis in effectfrom 11 a.m. Wednesday to 8 p.m. Monday across much of Southern California, including Los Angeles County, Ventura County and the southern Santa Barbara County coast.
For Riverside, Orange and San Bernardino counties, the warning takes effect at 10 a.m. Tuesday and lasts through 8 p.m. Monday.
“Generally, from Wednesday all the way through Monday, any one of those days in the valleys, mountains, foothills and deserts — especially in the valleys and deserts — we can see highs [above 110],” Sweet said.
California
An excessive heat watch is in place for much of Southern California this week. Keep yourself, your kids and your pets safe during hot temperatures with these tips.
Temperatures in Woodland Hills could reach 105 on Thursday and surge to 110 on Sunday. Lancaster in the Antelope Valley could reach as high as 108 on Thursday and Sunday. In Santa Clarita, Newhall could reach 106 on Thursday and 108 on Sunday.
“The entire state is likely to be very hot away from the immediate beaches, and it might even get pretty hot there,” Swain said. “But I think that the most relatively extreme temperatures and relative to historical averages is probably going to be in  interior, central and northern California: the San Joaquin and Sacramento valleys ... and the eastern San Francisco Bay Area.”
Such heat can be extremely dangerous, especially when temperatures don’t drop at night and allow the body time to recover from scorching daytime highs.
“We often focus on the daytime high temperatures — you know, 100, 110, 115 degrees,” Swain said. “And, of course, those can cause major impacts. But it’s often when heat waves don’t cool off at night that actually causes the most cumulative harm to human health and ecosystems.”
A Times investigation published last yearrevealed that California has done a poor job tracking the number of people who have died due to extreme heat and has largely failed to provide resources to communities that are most vulnerable to the effects of heat and global warming. In January, Gov. Gavin Newsom’s administrationannounced a planfor addressing extreme heat that includes recommendations on how to monitor deaths caused by heat waves and the possible establishment of temperature limits for residential units.
Climate & Environment
Read all of our coverage about how California is neglecting the climate threat posed by extreme heat.
Oppressive temperatures can increase the riskof heat-related illnesses, from rashes to heat exhaustion or heat stroke. Especially vulnerable are children, the elderly and those living with limited resources. The National Weather Service and public health offices advise people to stay indoors as much as possible during extreme heat —particularly between 10 a.m. and 3 p.m., when the sun is strongest — and to stay well-hydrated and utilize air conditioning when possible.
“This is one of the fastest warming times of the year in California, from a climate-change perspective,” Swain said. “Arguably, September is becoming a summer month. ... I think we’re really seeing that manifest this year, where we’re going to start off the month with record heat — and there’s every indication that the rest of the month is still likely to be mostly warmer than average.”

"LAPD searching for driver who ran over injured scooter rider with van, then drove off",https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2022-08-30/lapd-video-hit-run-driver-injured-scooter-rider,2022-08-31,"Los Angeles police are searching for the driver of a van that ran over an injured scooter rider Saturday in Boyle Heights and did not stop.
The department is offering $25,000 for information leading to the driver’s identification, arrest and conviction or settlement with the victim.
Just before 9 p.m. on Fickett Street, the Los Angeles Police Department said in a release, Luis Lopez was riding a scooter when he fell and was knocked unconscious.
Insurveillance footage released by the LAPD, Lopez is seen lying in the roadway, barely moving, for several seconds before a white Ford Econoline van comes into view.

"International travel resurgent at LAX, with nearly 100% year-over-year increase in passengers",https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2022-08-30/july-international-travelers-at-lax-nearly-double-last-year,2022-08-30,"Los Angeles International Airport saw 1.8 million international travelers last month, nearly double the number from July 2021, airport officials said Monday.
The year-over-year increase is a sign of continued recovery for the travel industry, but numbers still have yet to reach pre-pandemic levels; in July 2019, more than 2.5 million international passengers flew through LAX.
Between January and July, the airport saw 8.7 million international passengers, up more than 141% from the same period last year.
Overall traffic at LAX — both international and domestic — is up 57% from last year.
Housing & Homelessness
Last month’s decline shows a market that is cooling off, and the rest of the U.S. could soon see similar relief, according to a Realtor.com analysis.
“The strong rebound in international travel that we have seen during the peak summer months is very encouraging and adding to our overall growth in passenger numbers this season,” Justin Erbacci, chief executive of Los Angeles World Airports, said in a news release.
The numbers of flights available to Mexico and Canada have rebounded to near pre-pandemic figures, and flights to the Middle East have exceeded levels last seen in 2019.
But the numbers of flights to and from Europe and Asia continue to lag behind pre-pandemic availability, with travel to Asia from LAX still less than half of what it was before the pandemic.
In July 2019, 2,521 flights and more than 775,319 seats were available from LAX to Asia, representing the largest international destination for the airport. Fewer than 1,140 Asia-bound flights and just under 324,000 seats were available last month.

Newsom must do more to protect Californians from climate change and wildfire,https://www.latimes.com/california/newsletter/2022-09-30/essential-california-should-california-rebuild-burned-towns-essential-california,2022-09-30,"Good morning, and welcome to the Essential Californianewsletter. It’sFriday, Sept. 30, and I’m Anita Chabria, The Times’ California columnist.
This week, my colleague Erika D. Smith and I published a four-part series that asks an unpopular but crucial question:Should California rebuild everyvulnerable town burned by wildfire?
Our natural instinct is to offer aid to our fellow citizens in need — be it from fire, flood or other natural disasters such as the hurricane that devastated Florida this week.
But Erika and I spent months talking to climate scientists, fire officials, elected officials,residents who have been burned out of multiple homesand those who are in the process of rebuilding from the ashes of tragedy. What we found is a hard truth — the combination of climate change and cost means that rebuilding, in many cases, is a fool’s errand.
The chance of fire striking again is not just a risk, but a near certainty, meaning we areputting people back in harm’s way with our good intentions.
That’s whyErika and I are making the case to call it quitson our unqualified commitment to restore every town struck by catastrophe. It’s not that we don’t care about these communities. We do. We also are tired of seeing heartbreak repeated, at an enormous cost.
In the tiny Northern California town of Greenville, which burned almost entirely in last year’s Dixie fire, we discovered that, when all is said and done, it will probably cost about $1 billion  to rebuild a place where about 300 people plan on returning.
We are rooting for Greenville and the many wonderful people devoting themselves to bringing back a town they love, but we also see it asa call to action for Gov. Gavin Newsom.
California needs a comprehensive land-use plan that looks at where and how we rebuild through the lens ofscience, not sentiment. We have to decide if we will continue to allow new homes to be built in high-risk zones for fire, and if we do, how much responsibility we are collectively willing to take when they inevitably burn.
There are no easy answers, but our political leaders owe it to us to work on these painful uncertainties now.
I hope you’ll take some time to look at these columns, which can all be foundhere.
And now,here’s what’s happening across California:

Today’sCalifornia memoryis from Steven Frisch:
I came to California one misty spring morning over snowy peaks, across watery valleys, to emerald green hills where no one asked any questions. Here you can love, strive, accept, grow and be. Here I realized that all the things I learned as a child about faith in the future, service to community, love of nature, and finding your place, were true, here as well as there.

Hello, it’sFriday, Sept. 30,and  here are the stories you shouldn’t miss today:
Alarming rates of anxiety and depression
Young adults in Californiaexperience mental health challengesat alarming rates, with more than three-quarters reporting anxiety in the last year, more than half reporting depression, 31% experiencing suicidal thinking and 16% self-harm, according to the results of a survey commissioned by the California Endowment.
The numbers reflect a years-long trend of worsening mental health among young people that was exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic, experts say.
The poll of nearly 800 Californians ages 18 to 24 also foundyoung people facing significant barriersto getting help — with nearly half of those who wanted to speak to a mental health professional saying they had been unable to do so, and many saying cost or lack of access had stopped them.

Floods from Ian trap many in Florida
Rescue crewspiloted boats and waded through inundated streetsto save thousands of Floridians trapped amid flooded homes and shattered buildings left by Hurricane Ian, which crossed into the Atlantic Ocean and churned toward South Carolina.
The monstrous Category 4 hurricane, one of the strongest storms ever to hit the U.S., flooded homes on both the state’s coasts,cut off the only road accessto a barrier island, destroyed a historic waterfront pier and knocked out electricity to 2.67 million Florida homes and businesses — nearly a quarter of utility customers.
The Oakland school shooting was gang-related
At least two gunmen and an accomplice are believed to have beeninvolved in a gang-related shootingat an East Oakland high school campus this week in which two students and four staff members were wounded, two critically, police said.
The gunmen fired at least 30 rounds during the shooting at Rudsdale Newcomer High School, on the King Estates campus in the 8200 block of Fontaine Street, Oakland Police Chief LeRonne Armstrong said during a news conference. At least one other person was involved in the shooting, but there may be others, he said.No arrests have been made.
Supreme Court justices to tackle affirmative action, voting rights
The Supreme Court opens a historic term Monday by welcoming its first Black woman to the bench as itfaces challenges to past liberal rulingson race, affirmative action and voting rights. At issue this year is a long-standing dispute over the role of race in the law.
Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson joins a court whose conservative majority has put itself on a collision course with progressives and civil rights advocates who insist that equal opportunity and fair representation requires considering race.
The rulingscould have a broad effect,not only in higher education but also open the door to future challenges of racial diversity policies in the workforce.
The cost of cooling L.A.’s biggest houses in a heat wave
Cooling off a 1,500-square-foot bungalow in a heat wave is expensive enough. Buthow big are the billsfor the ever-larger mega-mansions crowning our hills?
Granted, those who can afford a $50-million home likely aren’t sweating a bloated electric bill, nor perhaps the carbon footprint, but experts say the cost of keeping a mansion cool can run well north of $10,000 per month.
Take “the One,” a 105,000-square-foot home in Bel-Air that set a record this year when it sold to the highest bidder for $141 million. Last year, a court-appointed receiver tasked with finding a buyer for the property told The Times that the monthlyelectric bill was $27,000. At the time, the air conditioning worked only on one level.

Six GOP-led states sue the Biden administration over the student loan plan.It’s at least the second legal challenge this week to the sweeping proposal laid out by President Biden in late August, when he said his administration would cancel up to $20,000 in education debt for huge numbers of borrowers. In the lawsuit,the Republican states arguethat Biden’s cancellation plan is “not remotely tailored to address the effects of the pandemic on federal student loan borrowers,” as required by the 2003 federal law that the administration is using as legal justification.
Virginia Thomas appears for an interview with Jan. 6 panel.The committee has for months sought an interview with Thomas, a conservative activist and wife of Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas, in an effort to know more about her role in trying to help former President Trumpoverturn his election defeat.She texted with White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows and contacted lawmakers in Arizona and Wisconsin in the weeks after the election.

Author responds to a family’s unrest over a controversial new Anthony Bourdain book.Charles Leerhsen’s new biography about the late “No Reservations” star includes some of the last text messages Bourdain sent before dying by suicide in 2018. “I used these like biographers of a previous era used personal letters.

“The Five’s” unlikely breakout star.As the most outspoken liberal Democrat regularly seen on the conservative Fox News, predictions of Jessica Tarlov’s demise come with the territory. But Tarlov isn’t going anywhere. The audience for “The Five” has grown 21% over last year,when she joined as a co-host, alternating with former congressman Harold Ford and veteran journalist Geraldo Rivera. Although online critiques from viewers who disagree with Tarlov can be harsh, she believes the audience increasingly understands and accepts her role.
He does what Brad Pitt and George Clooney can’t do.Although Demián Bichir had long been among Mexico’smost highly regarded actors,it wasn’t until 2011’s “A Better Life” — along with a recurring role on Showtime’s “Weeds” — that Hollywood began to take notice, landing him roles in films such as “The Hateful Eight” and “Godzilla vs. Kong.” But the new Showtime series “Let the Right One In” is new terrain for the actor: a leading role in a buzz-worthy genre property from the network behind last year’s breakout “Yellowjackets.” “I never, ever dreamed of such a beautiful life,” the actor said.
U.S. long-term mortgage rates are up for 6th week in a row.Mortgage buyer Freddie Mac reported Thursday that the average on thekey 30-year rate climbed to 6.70%, marking new highs not seen in 15 years, before a crash in the housing market triggered the Great Recession.

Why UCLA’s plans for an on-campus football stadium were spiked.More than a half-century ago, UCLA students nearly got to experience the buzz of home gamesmuch closer to home.Momentum was building for the construction of an on-campus stadium in 1965, back when the Bruins played their home games at the Coliseum. But decades later that dream remains unrealized, and UCLA and Miami remain the only Power Five conference teams to play home games more than a short drive from campus.

Coming into focus.Once thought to affect overstimulated boys primarily,  diagnoses for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, or ADHD, have sharply increased among adult women. But women aren’t suddenly waking up with a neurological disorder. It’s likely been there all along, masquerading as low self-esteem, depression, anxiety, “she’s difficult,” “she’s an airhead,” “she’s unlucky,” “she’s lazy,” and other labels that tend to mark a girl as she moves through her life.

After being bitten by a rabid fox, a congressman wants cheaper rabies treatments.Rabies deaths are rare in the U.S. A lot of that is thanks to the effective treatment available. But that lifesaving treatment is expensive, especially for those without health insurance, and can leave people saddled with thousands of dollars of debt. Rep. Ami Bera (D-Elk Grove) introduced legislation that would create a government program to reimburse healthcare providers who administer the treatment to uninsured people.NPR
Dancer Isadora Duncan died in an automobile accident 95 years ago this month.Duncan was trying out a new car on the Promenade des Anglais in Nice, France, when a gust of windblew a long scarf that she was wearingaround her neck over the side of the car. It became entangled in one of the wheels and dragged the dancer out of the machine into the roadway. Her neck was broken. A French chauffeur was teaching her to drive the new car, which was speeding along when the dancer met death.
Auto accidents seemed to play a significant role in Duncan’s life. On several occasions she was injured, sometimes seriously, in them, and in 1913 her two children, Beatrice, 5, and Patrick, 3, were drowned in the Seine, near Paris, when their vehicle ran into the river.

Saugus High School football team to stop carrying ‘thin blue line’ flag in pregame ceremonies,https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2022-09-30/saugus-football-team-to-stop-carrying-thin-blue-line-flag,2022-09-30,"The Saugus High School football team will no longer use the “thin blue line” flag in its pregame ceremonies after a decision by the team’s coach, the William S. Hart Union High School District superintendent said.
The flag, a black and white United States flag with a horizontal blue line, has become a contentious symbol. Some use it to declare support for law enforcement, while white nationalists and other extremist groups have adopted the flag for their own movements.
In a letter sent to the school community, Supt. Mike Kuhlman said the use of the flag had become controversial.
“Just three short days ago, I became aware of a concern about this symbol being flown at Saugus High School football games,” Kuhlman wrote in the letter dated Wednesday. “Despite emails for immediate action, and threats of consequences if certain steps weren’t taken within a specific timeline, we determined to take our time to understand the issue accurately and to respond thoughtfully.”
California
Los Angeles Police Capt. Lillian Carranza says her life in the LAPD became intolerable when a fake nude image of her was circulated among the department.
The school’s principal, Geni Peterson Henry, reportedly met with football coach Jason Bornn, who said he “was not even fully aware of the banners in question” although he noted that the team had never held a vote regarding any flag.
”...(It) occurred to (Bornn) that it’s possible that some players on the team might not be entirely enthusiastic about a symbol that is being used to represent the entire team,” Kuhlman wrote.
Bornn decided to discontinue the use of the flag “in deference to his commitment to inclusivity, kindness and respect...”
“Please note that this decision does not translate into a change in support for law enforcement,” Kuhlman wrote. “The degree of enthusiasm behind our District’s backing of law enforcement is not measured by the acceptance or rejection of any one particular symbol.”
The district is looking for alternative methods to show support for law enforcement, Kuhlman wrote.
The move did not sit well with some.
“This is unacceptable behavior at any of our schools, let alone Saugus,” one speaker said at a school district board meeting Wednesday. “It does represent the team. Yes, it does represent the students, the parents, the residents.”
“I’m dismayed and I’m upset,” said a speaker who identified herself as a 28-year LAPD veteran. “It is a profession that I’m truly proud of.”
California
The review comes amid an ongoing Times investigation into breakdowns in CSU’s handling of reports of sexual misconduct, workplace bullying and retaliation.
“I believe, personally, this is a slap in the face of those who came running towards danger at Saugus High School,” district board President Joe Messina said.
In 2019, Saugus High School was the site of a shooting that killed two students. The shooter, who also attended the high school, shot and killed himself in the attack.
Some speakers supported discontinuing the use of the flag and exploring alternatives.
“I think that there are thousands of other ways that we can show our support for our heroes,” said a parent of Saugus public schools. “Unfortunately, [the flag] has been co-opted by racist elements in this country, and it has a taint on it now.”
“As someone of the African American community, there was a spike in the popularity of the Blue Lives Matter flag after the rise in 2020 of the Black Lives Matter protests,” said a speaker who identified herself as a student at Golden Valley High School, in the neighborhood of Canyon Country. “A lot of people can get that confusion that the popularity of it came in spite of the Black Lives Matter protests.”
The speaker supported surveying the football players to gain their perspectives.
“If they’re just trying to promote and show their gratitude for law enforcement, that’s great,” the speaker said. “If their goal is something else, then I can see a problem with that.”

Former PG&E executives agree to $117-million settlement over California wildfires,https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2022-09-29/former-pg-e-executives-announce-117-million-settlement-over-california-wildfires,2022-10-03,"Former executives with utility giant Pacific Gas & Electric have reached a $117-million settlement agreement in connection with the 2017 North Bay fires and the 2018 Camp fire, officials said.
The former officers and directors were sued by a victim trust that claimed the deadly fires were the direct result of the former executives’ actions, and the trust announced on Thursday that the agreement was finalized in San Francisco County Superior Court.
A dozen fires that ripped through Northern California in October 2017 were sparked by downed power lines owned by PG&E, according to the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection.  The fires raged across California’s wine country, including Napa, Sonoma, Humboldt, Butte and Mendocino counties, and killed 19 people.
A year later, the Camp fire was sparked in Butte County by faulty electrical equipment operated by PG&E, authorities said. The fire decimated several communities, including the town of Paradise. In total, 85 people died in the fire, making it the deadliest blaze in the state’s history, according to authorities.
PG&E filed for bankruptcy in 2019 after it announced a $13.5-billion settlement with fire victims and their families. The PG&E Fire Victim Trust was created after the agreement under the utility company’s Chapter 11 reorganization plan.
Last year, the trust sued 20 former PG&E officers and directors, claiming they were directly responsible for the fires because of their breach of fiduciary duties to act in the best interest of the utility company.
Investigators with the California Public Utilities Commission found that there were systematic problems with PG&E’s oversight of the nearly 100-year-old power line that sparked the Camp fire. PG&E took over the power line in 1930, according to a December 2019 report.
California
Pacific Gas & Electric on Friday announced a $13.5 billion settlement for a string of recent fires in Northern California that killed dozens, and destroyed thousands of homes and businesses.
PG&E pleaded guilty to84 counts of involuntary manslaughterin federal court.
The lawsuit filed by the trust sought to hold the former executives accountable for not properly maintaining vegetation around electrical equipment and for not installing power shutoff equipment at the time of the 2017 fire. The suit also argued that the utility company did not properly update 100-year-old equipment in connection with the Camp fire.
Under its bankruptcy plan, PG&E allowed the Fire Victim Trust to pursue any claims held by the utility company, including against its former directors and officers, which the company says it suffered in connection with the wildfires, the trust said in a news release.
The settlement was finalized in July and the utility company is expected to submitted its approval in court, said attorney Frank Pitre, who is lead counsel for the trust in this lawsuit. Pitre is also a member of the trust’s oversight committee.
“These funds will be used to satisfy the vast majority of outstanding fire victim claims held by certain federal agencies that assisted in battling the fires and providing assistance to victims,” Pitre said in a statement.
That funding will go to agencies such as the Federal Emergency Management Agency, state agencies and other groups that helped house fire victims, Pitre said, which the trust is required to pay as part of the bankruptcy plan.
“With the vast majority of this settlement with the federal agencies satisfied, the trust is close to being able to use all future net recoveries from assigned claims to benefit other fire victims,” Pitre said.
News of the settlement was met with skepticism by Santa Rosa resident Will Abrams, whose home was destroyed in the Tubbs fire in 2017. As one of the approximately 70,000 victims who were affected  by the wildfires from 2015 to 2018, Abrams wants to know how much money the Fire Victim Trust is spending to pay for legal fees and to represent their interests.
“One group that absolutely benefits from the suits are the attorneys. The attorneys are getting paid for litigating these cases,” Abrams told The Times. “So if the federal agencies are getting the beneficiaries of this lawsuit and getting some monies out of this, how much of the attorneys’ fees and other fees are coming out of the Fire Victim Trust, coming out of victims’ pockets?”
Abrams has filed a motion in court for more transparency in the bankruptcy process and for the trust to disclose how much money is being spent.
Pitre  told The Times his firm is working on a contingency basis but did not disclose how much of the Fire Victim Trust is going to pay for attorney fees.
“The goal was always to try and preserve as much of the $13.5 billion that was earmarked and that was satisfied for the fire victims,” Pitre said.
Abrams said the opaque nature of the bankruptcy proceedings has left him frustrated. Nearly five years after the Tubbs fire, Abrams has still not received any information about how much money he can expect.
“Many victims are without understanding of how much they’re going to get paid,” Abrams said.
In a written statement, PG&E called the agreement “another step forward in PG&E’s ongoing effort to resolve issues outstanding from before its bankruptcy and to move forward focused on our commitments to deliver safe, clean and reliable energy to our customers, and to continue the important work of reducing risk across our energy system.”

Head to Joshua Tree to buy these native plants before they’re gone,https://www.latimes.com/lifestyle/story/2022-09-29/joshua-tree-native-plants-mojave-desert-land-trust,2022-09-29,"You’ll see it just east of Yucca Valley, along the busy Twentynine Palms Highway, a mysterious sign with four huge red letters — MDLT — underlined by a fat arrow pointing north. It’s only when you’re closer to the sign that you‘ll see the illustration of a multi-limbed Joshua tree arcing against a bright blue sky, signaling that you’ve arrived at the sandy-colored headquarters of the Mojave Desert Land Trust.
You’ll need these directions, and an early wakeup call, if you plan to attend the Land Trust’s biannual native plant sale on Oct. 8, which features solely plants that grow in the high and low lands of the Mojave Desert. The sale is short — from 9 a.m. to 1 p.m. — but eager buyers start lining up before 8 a.m., said Director of Communications Jessica Dacey, “and when we open the doors, they run.”


The sale also includes a few salvage items found on land trust properties, such as an old rusted pickup bed (that took six people to move, Dacey said), an old abandoned metal ice chest and a stack of weathered boards.
The land trust’s demonstration garden is open from sunrise to sunset every day for people who want to know what these native shrubs and trees look like when they’re older. One of the land trust’s main jobs is to purchase small parcels of private land within the desert’s national park and preserves, and then convey those lands to the national parks for continued protection. But it also operates a nursery devoted primarily to restoration and preservation work, Dacey said, such as its seed bank with seeds from some 700 plant collections stored in three giant refrigerators, “an insurance policy for the Mojave Desert.”
Lifestyle
The high desert may have gone upscale, but don’t worry — it’s still funky.

That nursery is closed to the public, but twice a year, in the spring and fall, the land trust provides plants for desert dwellers to buy for their yards, partly as a fundraiser but also to encourage plantings that improve local soils and build habitat.
You’ll find several sales for native plants in Southern California this month and next, since late fall and winter are the best time for planting most natives — but the land trust’s sale is one of the very few devoted to plants adapted to desert life. It gets hot here (it’s the desert, right?), but it also getsverycold, sometimes as low as 20 degrees, said Madena Asbell, the trust’s director of plant conservation. These hardy plants have evolved to survive in both extremes.
Some native plants do well throughout the region, such as California buckwheat and the red-throated California fuchsia, but others are less familiar outside of the desert, such as cheesebush (Ambrosia salsola), burro bush or bur-sage (Ambrosia dumosa) and yellow-blooming creosote bush (Larrea tridentata) — the Mojave Desert’s ubiquitous and foundational shrub that provides food and shelter to a number of species, including the desert tortoise. It also has a defining characteristic: “The smell of the desert we all think of, that smell after it rains?” Asbell said. “That’s the smell of creosote.”

Lifestyle
Why this gay couple from L.A. packed up and bought a home in Yucca Valley.

The land trust grows its plants from seeds collected on its desert lands, and creosote is slow-growing, so it won’t have any of those plants to sell until next year’s fall sale, said Asbell, but this year’s sale features50 other species,including rush milkweed (Asclepias subulata) and desert milkweed (Asclepias erosa); desert willows (Chilopsis linearis)with their frilly vanilla-scented blooms; and the delightfully named hole-in-the-sand (Nicolettia occidentalis),a skeletal, bristly-looking plant with bright pink and yellow flowers.
Pollinator alert: Buyers might take home more than a plant if they’re lucky. When we toured the headquarters to look at the sale offerings last week, we spied several caterpillars that’ll one day become black desert swallowtail butterflies and queen butterflies, an orange cousin of the monarch butterfly that also frequents desert milkweed, Asbell said.

They’ll be selling seeds at the sale and some cactus too, Asbell said, such as the lovely silver cholla (Cylindropuntia echinocereus), whose silvery bristles take on an ethereal glow in the setting sun. But Asbell said it’s wrong to think of cactuses as the only plants that grow in the desert. Shrubs actually have a much more important role, she said.
“It’s perfectly acceptable to plant cactus and succulents to preserve water, but we need native shrubs to enrich the environment,” she said. “There’s a common misperception that the desert is a wasteland, which it’s not. It’s a functional, thriving ecosystem and a lot of animals and people depend on this ecosystem to remain healthy, so the more we can do to keep these ecosystems intact and restore them or enhance them, the better.”


Asbell said many customers are urban dwellers who have a second home in the desert and are eager to add native plants to their landscapes. But planting in desert soils is different than in L.A., she said, an everything-you-know-is-wrong lesson she had to learn herself when she left her plant conservation job at the Theodore Payne Foundation in Sun Valley to start the plant conservation program at the land trust in 2016.
Travel & Experiences
More and more people are arriving in the towns along Highway 62 near Joshua Tree National Park. In their eagerness to feel those desert vibes, they’ve set off a full-blown boom.

For instance, she said, the rule of thumb when planting a tree or shrub around Los Angeles is to make the hole wider than the root ball to give the roots plenty of room to settle in. In the desert, she said, it’s best to keep the hole just big enough for the root ball to fit and no wider.

“If you dig too wide a hole, the soil you back fill with has been loosened and will dry out faster than the soil around it that’s not been disturbed,” she said. “So we’ve learned not to disturb much of the soil around where we need to put the plant in.”
Lifestyle
Working in a garden, walking in a garden, even looking at a garden can be beneficial for your physical and mental health, research shows.

The land trust has adesert landscaping guide, lists of plants toattract pollinators and other desert dwellersand aplanting guideon its website (while you’re on the website, check out the gorgeousland trust postersby L.A. artistEdward Lumas well). Asbell has these additional tips for successful desert planting:



Bottom line: Adding at least some of these native shrubs to your desert landscape will go a long way to nurturing wildlife and fighting off aridification — the drying out of soils to the point that nothing will grow. “More and more people are moving to this part of the desert, and it’s a beautiful place, so they’re drawn here for good reasons,” Asbell said. “I’m just glad this nursery exists, to offer these plants to people who don’t know where else to get them.”

"6 people shot, 2 with life-threatening injuries, at Oakland school campus",https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2022-09-28/at-least-five-injured-in-shooting-at-oakland-school,2022-09-29,"The Oakland Police Department is searching for at least two gunmen who fired 30 rounds at an East Oakland high school, injuring six people.
Six adults were wounded in a shooting Wednesday afternoon at an Oakland school campus, with two suffering life-threatening injuries, according to local officials.
The two with the most serious injuries were listed as  critical but stable at Oakland’s Highland Hospital, the county’s main trauma hospital,  while a third victim was listed as  stable, according to Alameda Health System officials.
The three others injured were either released or are soon to be released from a different hospital, Oakland Assistant Police Chief Darren Allison said at a news briefing. All six victims were 18 or older and had some “affiliation with the school,” but Allison did not say whether they were students or staff.
The King Estate  campus on Fontaine Street, where the shooting occurred, is home to multiple schools with students from grades 6-12 onsite. Police found the victims, all of whom were suffering from gunshot wounds, just before 1 p.m.
No suspects have been identified, Allison said, adding, “We are currently and actively looking for one shooter, although there may be other individuals involved.”
The shooting follows a particularly violent week for Oakland and comes just one day after the police chiefpledged an “all-hands-on-deck”response to the city’s gun violence.
Allison said the shooting occurred in the Rudsdale High School portion of the campus, but he did not clarify whether shots were fired inside or outside the school.
Rudsdale provides an alternative educational experience for mostly immigrant students between the ages of 16 and 21,according to the school’s website.Also on the campus is theBay Area Technology School, a public charter school for grades 6-12, and the Sojourner Truth Independent Study school, which operates an online learning program for K-12 students.
Because of its virtual setup, no students from Sojourner Truth were on campus Wednesday, according to a statement from the Oakland Unified School District. John Sasaki, a district spokesperson, did not say whether staff members were present in the school’s building, but he said it was the location of the school’s headquarters.
The Oakland Academy of Knowledge, an elementary school, is also near the King Estate campus, but Sasaki said the shooting did not “have anything to do with that elementary school.”
California
The extent of the teen’s injuries were not disclosed, and it was unclear whether the suspect was a student at Madison Park Academy.
Oakland City Councilmember Loren Taylor said the incident “hits close to home.”
“Our schools are supposed to be a place of uplifting, empowering,”Taylor told ABC7 News,“… not [a place] to witness tragedies like this.”
Parents were rushing to the campus Wednesday afternoon to reunite with their children after news of the shooting broke. Oakland Police Capt. Casey Johnson asked that witnesses or people with video of the shooting contact the agency.
Oakland Mayor Libby Schaaf lambasted the gun violence ina post on Twitter. “The unbridled access to firearms in our country is inexcusable,” she said.
Atweet from the governor’s officecalled the shooting “a horrifying act of violence that has grown too familiar.”
“Yet again, our kids were in the crossfire. This cannot continue — gun violence has taken too much from our communities.”
California
One man was killed and another seriously injured in the Tuesday afternoon shooting, which forced the City Council to pause its meeting.
Less than 24 hours before the shooting, Oakland Police Chief LeRonne L. Armstrongaddressed the communityafter eight people were killed in the city’s deadliest week this year, according to the Police Department. He said the agency was “reorganizing and redeploying additional officers” to better respond to shootings, noting that a majority of the incidents were tied to group and gang violence.
“We are going all-hands-on-deck to address gun violence in the city of Oakland,” Armstrong said.
“This has been a rough year in Oakland,” Sasaki, the Oakland Unified spokesperson, said at a news conference. “But it doesn’t define us; it doesn’t define the school district and it doesn’t define the city.”
Late last month, a 13-year-old student at Madison Park Academy was accidentally shot by another student. The victim survived, and the other student was charged.
“This cannot keep happening in our city,” Sasaki said. “Everybody needs to do everything we can to ensure that our kids are loved and supported.”
Oakland schools have what Sasaki called “culture keepers,” unarmed school staffers who support the students “to ensure that they stay safe on our campuses.”
The culture keepers were on campus Wednesday, but it was unclear how many.

"In groundbreaking plan, California allows affordable housing on some commercial properties",https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2022-09-28/california-affordable-housing-commercial-properties,2022-09-28,"In a historic deal between affordable housing groups and labor unions, Gov. Gavin Newsom  signed two major bills Wednesday toconvert underutilized and vacant commercial buildings into housing.
Senate Bill 6andAssembly Bill 2011incentivize housing projects in commercial corridors otherwise zoned for large retail and office buildings as a way to help California fill a multimillion-unit shortage in its housing supply. Both bills guarantee union-scale wages and promise an expedited construction process, while keeping development close to city centers to help the state meet its environmental goals and avoid sprawl.
Newsom said the two laws will help California address the state’s “original sin” of housing affordability.
“It has been a stubborn issue. Decade after decade after decade, just fighting and talking about it and fighting each other in the process,” Newsom said.
“I think what makes today a special day is this is a big moment as we begin ... to take responsibility, not to give the same speech and expect the same applause, but to begin to do something about it,” Newsom said during a  news conference in San Francisco to sign the two proposals and dozens of other measures. “This is a big package. These bills matter.”
Gridlock among several opposing forces in the Capitol — where unions, developers and affordable housing groupsregularly stall legislation over disputed labor standards— nearly capsized this year’s historic deal. The powerful State Building and Construction Trades Council of California backed SB 6, along with builders and business groups, while the California Conference of Carpenters and the Service Employees International Union of California broke from other labor groups to support AB 2011.
“Every organization took a position that benefited them the best and decided which bill they wanted to support. And part of the challenge there is that each coalition of people were ready to have the other bill die in order for their bill to be successful,” said state Sen. Anna Caballero (D-Salinas). “The problem was that you couldn’t get to that perfect middle with some of the groups. They just wouldn’t go there.”
The two bills offer developers options on projects intended to convert underutilized and vacant commercial spaces such as big-box stores, strip malls and office buildings into much-needed housing.
Despite the energy and effort required to pass the bills, both Caballero and Assemblymember Buffy Wicks, an Oakland Democrat who wrote AB 2011, said they’re willing to broker a future deal on similar legislation.
California
Gov. Gavin Newsom signs bill into law that will go into effect Jan. 1 and make California the first state in the U.S. to prohibit harmful testing on dogs and cats.
“Today we are taking a monumental step in our efforts to turn our housing crisis in a different direction,”  Wicks said in a statement. “The governor’s signature on AB 2011 marks a turning point for California’s housing production needs — no longer will lack of land be an issue. No longer will there be a lack of incentive for workers to join the construction workforce. And, no longer will red tape and bureaucracy prohibit us from building housing in the right locations to address our climate crisis.”
Experts say the effect on California’s housing supply could be significant.
Caballero said SB 6 will help rural communities recover from a big chain store exodus that left behind a trail of vacant buildings and parking lots. She sees the new law as a way to produce housing for first-time buyers.
Housing advocates are particularly excited about AB 2011.
An August analysis by UrbanFootprint, a software platform that analyzes city data for urban planners and local governments, found that the new law could produce1.6 million to 2.4 million new homes, depending on market conditions, including hundreds of thousands of affordable units.
“AB 2011 has tremendous potential to unlock ... a ton of land for development that was previously off-limits,” said David Garcia, policy director for UC Berkeley’s Terner Center for Housing Innovation. “It’s a huge deal.”
Garcia said he sees both bills as a sign that lawmakers in Sacramento are taking a stronger “pro-housing approach” and are willing to push for the kind of legislation that is notoriously difficult to pass amid interest group infighting.
Ray Pearl, executive director of the California Housing Consortium, one of the co-sponsors of AB 2011, called the measure a “game changer.”
“It’s really unprecedented that we brought together all of those different groups. As you look forward, nothing is ever easy in Sacramento, nor should it be,” Pearl said. “But there are a lot of folks that want similar outcomes. Hopefully, we are going to be able to use this coalition for future efforts.”
Erin Lehane, legislative director for the trades council, said SB 6 will provide valuable work to local residents.
“These are opportunities for young people who really, really need the opportunity,” she said.
To finalize a deal, Caballero and Wicks worked together to craft two bills that promised each coalition a slice of the pie.
“As the clock started ticking down, we both agreed we would make some amendments that would give each one of us what we wanted,” Caballero said, even if that meant “everybody was a little bit unhappy” with the final product.
Housing & Homelessness
When developers build affordable housing in a luxury complex like the Grand LA, the units are added to a regional pool that are rented out by lottery.
The Assembly bill includes a requirement for union-scale wages, along with stringent environmental standards and a mandate that a certain percentage of the units be affordable for low- and extremely low-income residents.
Some projects would be exempt from local governments’ discretionary approval process as well as the restrictive California Environmental Quality Act, which has been used as a legal weapon to slow down or even halt housing construction.
The labor requirement ensures that contractors provide healthcare benefits and union-level pay, so-calledprevailing wages, to all workers, even if some aren’t unionized. Contractors have argued that prevailing-wage requirements drive up costs and housing prices.
The Senate’s version was billed as a “middle-class” housing proposal, and requires the union-scale wages as a minimum labor standard while ensuring that a so-called skilled and trained workforce is used in most situations. The additional regulation guarantees most workers are unionized.
The cautious optimism about future legislative housing agreements could be short-lived, however.
Lehane said the trade unions remain concerned about most residential housing construction projects, especially those not using union workers, because those builders are “paying and treating workers unfairly.”
“I think that is not something that changes overnight,” she said. “As our responsibility, we need to remain ever vigilant to that.”
The new laws will go into effect July 1.
In a future ravaged by climate change, wildfires will strain resources. Bringing back every town will only put people in mortal danger once again.

‘A story of extinction.’ La Brea Tar Pits recognized as a geological heritage site,https://www.latimes.com/science/story/2022-10-28/a-story-of-extinction-the-la-brea-tar-pits-recognized-as-a-geological-heritage-site,2022-10-28,"ZUMAIA, Spain —On a recent fall day, a dragonfly came to rest in Hancock Park, most likely searching for a place to lay her eggs. She landed on a slick of accumulated rainwater no more than a few millimeters deep.
But something was wrong. Her body held fast to the water, or to something just beneath it. She beat her wings furiously for several minutes before the flapping slowed, then stopped. A process that had taken place innumerable times in the last 40,000 years was over.
For the record:
4:22 p.m. Oct. 28, 2022An earlier version of this story said the dragonfly that got stuck in the asphalt was observed near Pit 23 of the La Brea Tar Pits. It was near Pit 91.
“Active entrapment, there,”Emily Lindsey,a curator at the La Brea Tar Pits, said as she observed the proceedings near Pit 91. The ill-fated insect had followed dire wolves, a Harlan’s ground sloth, a Western horse and a retinue of other creatures into that particular patch of unforgiving asphalt.
When one thinks of natural wonders, the Mid-Wilshire area is not what comes to mind. But no other spot on Earth has such a complete fossil record of the late Quaternary Period. It’s one of the planet’s best-kept records of the stretch of time that ended roughly 15,000 years ago inan extinction eventfeaturing global warming, wildfires and human activity.
Intriguing as that past may be, what it tells us about the future may be even more important. The muck in Hancock Park holds valuable clues about where we’re heading now.
On Friday, the La Brea Tar Pits were recognized as one of the world’sFirst 100 IUGS Geological Heritage Sites.The designation is akin to a lifetime achievement award bestowed by the International Union of Geological Sciences, with the lifetime in question being that of this planet.
IfUNESCO’s World Heritage sitesare places that collectively tell humanity’s story, the IUGS sites are the story of our home, and of humanity’s efforts to understand it. (UNESCO is in fact one of the organizations supporting the IUGS project.) More sites will be named in coming years.
Science & Medicine
Just beyond the traffic and palm trees of Wilshire Boulevard, hidden beneath the shadows of nondescript office buildings, lie the tar-slicked bones of many thousand long-dead creatures.
Many of the designees unveiled in an exuberantly nerdy weeklong conference here in northern Spain are sweeping natural spectaculars where nature really shows off: the Grand Canyon, Iguazu Falls straddling the border of Brazil and Argentina, the top of Mt. Everest.
Nearly all are ensconced in forests, deserts or protected areas; some remain well-preserved simply because they are far from modern human settlements. (“It’s quite remote to get to,” a British geologist said mildly ofSirius Passet,an exquisite collection of Cambrian fossils in the far reaches of north Greenland that is on the list.)
Of the 100 inaugural sites, exactly one is located in the middle of a city.
::
Los Angeles knows about the Tar Pits, obviously. Before the pandemic, nearly half a million people visited each year. It rarely takes more than one sighting of afiberglassmammoth familywatching its mother sink into “tar” for the image to sear into one’s brain. (Nearly everything aboutthe sculpturesis scientifically inaccurate, by the way, but the emotional impact is real.)
Still, the Tar Pits are not the city’s signature attraction, and they lack the kind of gravitas that other sites on the IUGS list command. No one abandons a Lime scooter on thePerito Moreno Glacierin Argentina or builds an Equinox gym right next to the Zambezi River’sVictoria Falls.
What may not have fully sunk in for Angelenos on those field trips and family outings is how crucially important the Tar Pits are for understanding life on this planet.
The Tar Pits don’t really contain tar, which is a byproduct of various types of fossil fuel production. They’re actually what are known as asphalt seeps.
The sticky stuff captured mammoths, saber-toothed cats, giant sloths and other iconic Ice Age mammals along with a near-perfect cross-section of the world they inhabited: birds, insects, plants, seeds, pollens. The fossils in the pits can tell scientists what the animals ate, what their environment looked like and what made them sicken or die.
“There is just nothing else like it,” saidLori Bettison-Varga,president of the Natural History Museum of Los Angeles County, which oversees the site in Hancock Park.
::
At the other end of the flashiness scale are thetowering rock formationsalong the beach in Zumaia, a small town in Spain’s Basque Country where the IUGS kicked off its celebration of geological heritage sites. “Game of Thrones”filmed scenes on the shore,and the CGI dragons added later in production are less impressive than what nature put here first.
The sheets of striated rock reach up to 700 feet high and line more than six miles of coastline. Once part of an ancient seafloor, each layer contains roughly 100,000 years’ worth of accumulated sediment, marking the passage of time like rings in a tree.
The rock built up at the bottom of the ocean for more than 50 million years, until the titanic force of the Iberian Peninsula smashing into Europe forced it all upward, like a waking giant tossing off his blankets.
Zumaia’s flysch — the geologic term for this kind of rock formation — is not the only flysch on Earth. But it is by wide agreement the very best flysch of all.
So, of course, dozens of scientists boarded a tour boat to admire it from the water.
“There,” saidRegan Dunn,a paleobotanist at the La Brea Tar Pits, as she pointed at a fold in the rock. “That’s theK-Pg boundary”— the visible line of iridium deposits left by the asteroid strike that wiped out the dinosaurs and roughly 75% of other living things on Earth.
The vessel listed to one side as passengers rushed to take photos the way some Los Angeles tourists do on bus tours of movie star homes.
Science & Medicine
This summer a team of paleontologists piled into trucks in Los Angeles and set out for scorching southern Utah to collect a stegosaurus fossil.
Later, Dunn andLuis Chiappe,the Natural History Museum’s head of research and collections, hiked down the flysch to get a closer look. The strip was about 2 to 3 inches wide, with a mineral-like texture and cookies-and-cream color completely different from the miles of rock on either side of it.
The K-Pg boundary marks the end of one version of the planet. Dunn placed her hands on the rock ballooning above it, which represents the resurgence of life in the millions of years after the asteroid struck.
“A world without dinosaurs,” she said, running her hands along the outcrop. “Can you feel it?”
::
It is fair to say that paleontology is not L.A.’s best-known industry. The Tar Pits site is small enough that even many of the experts attending the IUGS summit weren’t familiar with it.
“When I saw the photos, and saw the indication of Quaternary, tar and the fossils, I said, ‘Wow,’” said Marie-Luise Frey, a geologist who manages the nonprofit organization that oversees theMessel Pit Fossil Site,an Eocene-era fossil bed in a forest outside Frankfurt, Germany, that also made the IUGS list.
“It’s absolutely amazing,” Frey said of the Tar Pits. “I don’t know any other site where it is like that.”
Entertainment & Arts
The La Brea Tar Pits, formed some 38,000 years ago and excavated in 1913, are getting a fresh new look.
In a way, the Tar Pits are a big part of what built Los Angeles into the city it is today.
Chumash and Tongva people used the local asphalt to waterproof boats and baskets. The first oil field in Los Angeles was discovered in 1892 after two unsuccessful gold prospectors dug into an asphalt seep near what is now Dodger Stadium. By the early 1900s, L.A.’s oil boom was officially underway, and the most productive field in the state covered the area that is now called Hancock Park.
George Hancock, owner of the Rancho La Brea Oil Co., was intrigued by the unusual bones his workers unearthed. He donated 23 acres of land to Los Angeles County specifically for the fossils’ preservation and display. The La Brea Tar Pits now occupies 13 of those; the Los Angeles County Museum of Art and a public park make up the rest.
L.A.’s Quaternary fossils stretch far beyond the boundaries of the one place in the city set up to deal with them. When virtually anything is built near Mid-Wilshire, the Natural History Museum receives crateloads of fossils unearthed during construction.
The Academy Museum of Motion Pictures: fossils. That Equinox gym: fossils. The underground parking structure at LACMA revealed 16 new pits — essentially 16 giant, jumbled knots of ancient tar, bone, plants and pollen. Each was carefully excavated by a landscaping company, boxed up and carted to the Tar Pits.
Science & Medicine
Every Thursday morning, Judith Sydner-Gordon puts on the same simple uniform: khaki cargo pants and an electric orange T-shirt with a saber-toothed cat emblazoned across the front.
Sometimes it’s hard for visitors to think of the Tar Pits as real, said Lindsey, the curator.
“People come to Los Angeles expecting to see experiences that are imagined, that are created,” she said, noting the proximity of Hollywood and Disneyland. “Our excavation staff, the paleontologists who are digging up fossils — they think they’re actors. And they think the people working in the fossil lab are actors. They’ve even thought that they were holograms, or animatronic.”
It’s also hard for people to understand that the events captured in the asphalt took place relatively recently. Dinosaurs went extinct about 65 million years ago. The Columbian mammoths featured in that faux family drama were last on this planet 10,000 years ago. In geologic terms, that is nothing at all.
Squirrels, birds and bugs still get stuck in the exposed pits at Hancock Park. Paleontologists don’t have to imagine what the process looked like, the way they do with dinosaurs — they can watch it happen, in the same place it did 35,000 years ago. They can see how water covers the asphalt the morning after a rain, and that the deadly traps would have looked like enticing drinking holes to the many creatures who have died there.
That’s why the Tar Pits matter. They show us what the last major extinction event looked like as we appear to enter another one largely fueled by consumption of the petroleum that trapped all those earlier animals.
Science & Medicine
Accelerating wildfires played a key role in the Great Dying by destroying ecosystems too quickly for plant and animal species to adapt.
It’s a record of what died, of course, but it also tells us what lived, and possibly even why.
“It’s not just a story of extinction,” said Bettison-Varga, the Natural History Museum’s president. “It’s a story of survival.”

Beverly Hills High School wrestling coach fired after shoving student,https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2022-11-29/beverly-hills-high-school-wrestling-coach-fired-shoving-student,2022-11-29,"A Beverly Hills High School wrestling coach was fired after shoving a student in an incident that was caught on camera, school district officials said.
Campus security video recorded Nov. 2 and released through a public records request shows the coach, Ryan Faintich, speaking with the student as another boy stands nearby. The coach places his hand on the student’s shoulder and pushes him once before continuing to talk, then shoves the student twice more before leaving.
The coach was suspended immediately after the incident and was fired last week, Beverly Hills Unified School District officials said.
“A few weeks ago, I was utterly disappointed to learn of an incident that took place where an employee was physically aggressive towards a student,” Supt. Michael Bregy said in a statement. “Appropriate steps were immediately taken to thoroughly investigate the event. No stone was left unturned, witnesses were interviewed, and the video footage from before, during, and after the incident was scrutinized. The employee no longer works for BHUSD.”
California
The deaths of three relatives are thought to be connected to a catfishing scheme against a teenage girl. The suspect was fatally shot, officials say.
At a Beverly Hills school board meeting last week, many speakers called for Faintich to be reinstated.
“Please, board, I ask you, I beg you to please reevaluate and reinstate Coach Ryan,” said one speaker who identified herself as the mother of a senior on the wrestling team.
Several speakers alleged that Faintich had been defending another student during the incident.
One speaker, who identified himself as a student present during the altercation, alleged that the student Faintich shoved had bullied and assaulted a wrestler, giving him a black eye.
Faintich spoke at the meeting and apologized for his actions.
“A lot of people came here today angry and upset and wanted an apology on the way this matter was handled,” Faintich said. “It is I that owe them that apology.”
“The choice I made to make contact physically with a student of Beverly Hills was not the right way to handle the situation. There was a better way to handle it,” he said.

A firework blew up in her hand. This South L.A. teen responded with courage and resilience,https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2022-12-31/firework-injury-south-los-angeles,2022-12-31,"In the hospital, La’Veyah Mosley struggled at first to understand what had happened. The 12-year-old girl woke up with both arms covered in layers of gauze.
“Do I have fingers?” she asked her mother, Staneisha Matthews.
The doctor eventually told her the hard news: On her left hand, no, she did not. Matthews reassured La’Veyah that she would recover, then slipped away to the hallway to cry.
La’Veyah is soft-spoken and shy — apt to sometimes keep her troubles inside. But in sports, she’s competitive, and in the months to come she would display remarkable strength. Even in her hospital bed, she remained optimistic and comforted her mother: “Mom, I’m OK.”
Just days earlier, La’Veyah had been playing outside in her family’s front yard in Broadway-Manchester with her two sisters, waving around a sparkler the morning after the Fourth of July holiday.
A neighborhood friend handed her another firework he had found in the street. He said it was a smoke bomb. Her twin sister, La’Niyah, needed to go the bathroom and begged her to wait to light it until she got back. La’Veyah stood impatiently while her younger sister, 8-year-old Jay’la, bounced with anticipation.
But La’Veyah couldn’t wait. She held the smoke bomb in her left hand and ignited  it with the sparkler, expecting a burst of color.
The ensuing blast  ripped the air with a blinding flash and a sharp crack.
Then absolute silence. La’Veyah lay crumpled on the ground, ears ringing. White smoke filled the air. Jay’la was lying in the dirt somewhere behind her.
La’Niyah stood frozen in the living room as the explosion shook the apartment. She ran over to La’Veyah and dragged her up the concrete steps and into the living room, screaming for their mother.
Matthews, 33, was in her room folding laundry. She ran out to find them huddled on the floor, blood pooling around them. So much blood was pouring out of La’Veyah that her mother couldn’t figure out where it was coming from, how this had happened. It felt like a horror movie.
Outside, Jay’la was screaming that she couldn’t hear. La’Veyah was shaking. Her hand felt as if  it was on fire.
At the hospital, doctors surveyed the damage: La’Veyah had suffered corneal abrasions in both eyes, ruptured eardrums and fractures in her forearms and in the fingers of her right hand. Her wrist bones had been dislocated by the blast. Those would heal. But she lost all  the fingers on her left hand, and her right hand was severely burned.
She learned the blast had not come from a smoke bomb butmost likely a powerful firecracker like an M-80, which are illegal but common in California.
Wounds like La’Veyah’s are more often inflicted in war zones. Yet fireworks such as  M-80s and bottle rockets have, for decades, caused devastating injuries to unsuspecting residents.
Column One
A showcase for compelling storytelling from the Los Angeles Times.
In 2021, the Los Angeles Fire Department responded to 280 fireworks-related calls, with more than 100 people  suffering injuries. Sparklers cause many of the burns, blazing at over 2,000 degrees. Fire Station 66 in South L.A., which responded to La’Veyah’s accident, is among those that receive the highest number of fireworks-related calls.
Such injuries have increased over the last several years, according to the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission. Between 2006  and 2021, injuries went up by a quarter, according to theagency’s latest report.
Last year, about 11,500 people were injured by fireworks in the U.S., and nine people died. Children 15 and younger accounted for 29% of injuries. The body parts most often damaged are hands and fingers.
Harbor-UCLA Medical Center, where La’Veyah was treated, in July saw so many patients injured by fireworks that a whole floor was dedicated to treating them.
Dr. Jennifer Hsu, an orthopedic surgeon and chief of microvascular upper extremity and hand surgery, treated 19 patients for traumatic fireworks injuries over the July 4 holiday, the most she has seen in her nine years at the hospital. Sixteen were children, who in many cases did not understand what they had picked up.
“It’s so devastating to see these kids come in and see them go through multiple procedures to try and save as much of their hand as possible,” Hsu said. “Even after the physical wounds heal, for many of them the psychological wounds can carry on long after.”
La’Veyah spent 10 days in the hospital, where doctors worked to save her hands. What remained of her left thumb, wrist and palm left open the possibility of reconstructive surgery.
Her mom feared La’Veyah didn’t yet grasp the full consequences, the permanence of the missing fingers, and watched La’Veyah closely for signs of depression or sadness. Veyah, as she is known to friends and family, had dreamed of playing professional basketball when she grew up. Would her daughter, Matthews wondered, ever play any sport again?
And what about psychological trauma? With the burst of a firework, everyone who was there could be jolted back to the horror of that morning.
When La’Veyah returned from the hospital, Matthews hoped to keep her at home as she recovered from her injuries. But La’Veyah pleaded to at least sit in the bleachers to watch her youth football team practice.
She was back on TikTok 13 days after the accident, her arms in casts and slings,doing a dance with her twin.
She used the platform to update her friends on how her hands were healing, flexing the fingers on her scarred right hand for the camera, and even sharing a small still image of her left.
“She’s a different type of strong,” Matthews said. “It’s like she has a point to prove.”
::
On a cool August evening,10 days before school would start, La’Veyah sat by herself on a bench overlooking the football field at the Watts Learning Center Middle School.
She recently had been out there warming up alongside her football teammates — one of four girls, including her sister, to make the team. Her days back then were busy: basketball practice every day after school, followed by football practice for another two hours, four times a week.
“It was hard,” she said quietly as she watched her twin sister run drills alongside the boys. “Sometimes I miss doing it.”
A teammate, Izabella, joined her on the bench. It had been a while since they had last seen each other. They went over first-day-of-school outfits before Izabella broached the topic of her injury.
“So you’re going to have a cast [at school]?” Izabella asked. La’Veyah nodded, holding up her right hand.
“I write with my three fingers,” she explained. “It’s easy. Like, I’ll hold a fork with my three fingers right here.” La’Veyah showed Izabella how her fingernails were already growing back. They didn’t speak about her left hand.
Marc Maye, the general manager of the youth football team, said La’Veyah asked to return to the team days after she left the hospital. The resilience she displayed after her injury was the same determination he’d seen her carry onto the football field, playing mostly against boys.
“She gets knocked down and she gets back up,” Maye said. “That’s how she’s able to compete and be around all those guys and not be afraid.”
But he couldn’t let her play. Not yet. He appointed her junior coach.
La’Veyah thought she still might be able to play basketball and wondered what a prosthetic hand would look like and how it would work. She imagined it shooting lasers.
At a fundraiser event at LAFD Station No. 64, La’Veyah spoke about what had happened,fighting her shyness.
She recounted the accident  in front of cameras and a crowd of 40 who came out toraise money for her GoFundMeto pay her medical bills.
LAFD Assistant Chief Jaime Moore said her story was one they could all learn from.
“As tragic as La’Veyah’s injuries were, it could’ve been much worse,” Moore said. “La’Veyah should show all of us that there is an opportunity to change what’s happening in Los Angeles next year with fireworks.”
::
La’Veyah was having a difficult time at doctor appointments, where Dr. Hsu had to change her casts and examine her hands.
Those were the hardest days, La’Veyah said. She would steel herself for what was to come and tried her best to keep from crying, but even the painkillers helped little against the searing pain. Matthews gently cradled La’Veyah and they got through it together.
In August, Matthews told La’Veyah she could delay going back to school and do independent study. She worried what other kids would say to La’Veyah about her injuries or if she would overexert herself.
La’Veyah, was insistent:She wanted to be back in class.
On the first day of school, her classmates avoided awkward questions about her injuries. At lunch, La’Veyah managed to open ketchup packets on her own with her teeth but needed La’Niyah’s help to soften and open her frozen kiwi strawberry slushy drink.
But in September, the twins began having trouble with boys at school. One of them called La’Veyah a “disabled b—,” Matthews said. They began taunting La’Niyah about her sister’s missing fingers. Twice, Matthews said, La’Veyah nearly got into physical fights with classmates who had mocked her. La’Niyah would quickly appear beside her, forcing the boys to reconsider.
When asked about the bullying, La’Veyah’s shoulders fell. “I don’t care,” she said softly. La’Niyah agreed.
But Matthews agonized over her daughters being picked on. She decided to take the girls out of Samuel Gompers Middle School and enroll them at Grace Hopper STEM Academy, a charter school in Inglewood with separate campuses for boys and girls.
Maybe there, she thought, they could find a way to move forward.
::
Before their arrival, Principal Yesmin Ortiz briefed the seventh-graders on the Mosley twins. Like them, other students had faced hardships, coming from broken homes and foster families.
If La’Veyah and La’Niyah want to share what happened, they would, Ortiz told the students. But she cautioned them not to press the girls.
By the time they arrived, most of the classmates already knew. La’Veyah’s story had already been covered bylocal news outlets. On Instagram, Matthews shared updates of the twins, capturing moments such as  La’Niyah buttoning up her sister’s sweater and the family out on a long bike ride.
The girls became part of Grace Hopper’s 19-member seventh-grade class. With a 1-to-15 teacher to student ratio, La’Veyah would get individualized help to keep her on track, even when she missed class because of  doctor appointments.
At Grace Hopper, the sisters joined their classmates on a trip to the La Brea Tar Pits, where they gawked at the mammoth fossils. Just before school let out for winter break, they joined their classmates at the Natural History Museum of Los Angeles County.
They walked around the displays, peering at bugs under microscopes. La’Veyah paused at an upright life-size polar bear display, touching its left paw gently with her right hand.
Matthews was greatly relieved at how they were integrating into the new school, joining the basketball, chess and fitness clubs.
“Nobody here is mean,” La’Niyah reflected. In basketball, her sister had already relearned how to play. Without the casts, La’Veyah steadies the ball with her left hand and shoots with her right.
Thanhdi Nguyen, the health teacher and fitness instructor at the school, saw the girls slowly come out of their shells. For a while, La’Veyah would lean on her sister to answer for her. But when it came to competitions in the fitness club,such as relay races or games, the twins lighted up.
“They keep each other up to speed,” Nguyen said. “Any time I put on some type of competition, they’re ready for it.”
Matthews fears the fireworks on New Year’s Eve will be too much to bear and plans to take the girls out of town. But otherwise, the family was ready to move forward. Already, the girls were preparing for the spring semester at Grace Hopper.
On a recent evening, Matthews took the family to an ice rink at L.A. Live. After the year they had had as a family, she wanted them to experience something joyful. La’Veyah took to the ice and, once more, barreled ahead.
“OK, Veyah! OK, girl!” Matthews cheered as her daughter, wearing a black beanie, shot away on her skates. “I can’t follow you that fast!”

"Final California inflation relief payments are coming, with debit cards being sent by Jan. 14",https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2022-12-29/final-california-inflation-relief-payments-debit-cards-january,2022-12-29,"If you still have not received your California inflation relief payment, it could be on its way in the new year.
All direct deposit payments from the Middle Class Tax Refund program have been issued, according to the California Franchise Tax Board, and the remaining payouts will be sent as debit cards expected to be mailed out by Jan. 14.
The eligible residents yet to receive their debit cards are those who received theirstate-issued pandemic stimulus paymentsthrough direct deposit but changed their banking information after filing their 2020 taxes, according to the Franchise Tax Board.
As of Thursday, the state has issued more than 7 million direct deposits and more than 8 million debit cards for a total of $8.4 billion — representing most of the $9.5 billion set aside for thetax refund programmeant to help Californians with the soaring cost of gasoline, groceries and other goods over recent months.
Business
Holiday sales rose as American spending remained resilient during the critical shopping season despite surging prices for food and rent.
The payments range from $200 to $1,050, depending on filing status and claimed dependents.
California began sending funds in early October, and direct deposits were completed by mid-November.
1. Am I eligible to get money through the California Middle Class Tax Refund?
There are severalimportant qualifications to keep in mind.According to the state Franchise Tax Board, eligible Californians must:
2. Am I supposed to receive a debit card?
It depends on how you filed your 2020 income tax return and whether you still have the same bank account.
If you filed your 2020 income tax return electronically but have since changed your bank or account number, then you will receive a debit card.
3. When should the money arrive?

Three family members found shot to death in home near Montclair; deputies search for suspect,https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2023-01-31/three-bodies-found-montclair-home,2023-02-01,"Homicide investigators are searching for a suspect after deputies found three family members shot to death at a home near Montclair on Monday night.
Deputies with the San Bernardino County Sheriff’s Department went to a home in the 4800 block of Ramona Place shortly after 9 p.m. after receiving reports that three people had been found dead, according to Public Information Officer Mara Rodriguez.
All three victims had gunshot wounds, and the incident did not appear to be a murder-suicide, according to authorities.
The Sheriff’s Department identified the victims as Sonia Ramirez, 68, George Ramirez, 66, and David Ramirez, 43.
George and Sonia Ramirez were married, officials said.
A woman who spoke with The Times on Tuesday afternoon and asked to remain anonymous said that the victims were her parents and her brother and that the family had been shattered by the killings.
“Our family is devastated by the great loss we are suffering. It is an understatement to say that George and Sonia Ramirez were devoted, compassionate, selfless and kind. As parents, their love was boundless. Our brother, David Ramirez, was our family protector, a doting father and an incredibly supportive son. We are relying on the Sheriff’s Department to investigate and apprehend the person who committed this heinous act. As we grieve, we ask for prayers and respect for our privacy so our family can process and mourn.”
Yellow crime scene tape blocked off the stuccoed two-story home on Ramona Place, a dead-end street in an unincorporated area just south of Montclair. Multiple vehicles were parked in the yard.
California
Accounts from witnesses inside Star Ballroom Dance Studio paint a clearer view of what happened when a man walked into the Monterey Park studio armed with a semiautomatic pistol.
Investigators also entered a garage next door to the home, but authorities did not disclose how it was related to their investigation.
April Bravo, 26, lives on the next street over and said she usually walks around at night without any hesitation for her safety.
“This is a quiet street,” Bravo said. “It’s a dead-end street, so when anyone comes down, everyone on the street knows it.”
Ray Reyes, who has lived on the block for nearly 30 years, said he could not recall the last time police were called to Ramona Place.
“It’s so weird,” Reyes said about the killings. “Nothing like this has ever happened.”
California
Chunli Zhao, accused of killing seven people in Half Moon Bay, told investigators an argument over a $100 bill for a damaged forklift prompted the shootings.
He was at home Monday night but said he did not hear any gunshots or loud noises.
Trina Campbell approached the home Tuesday where the bodies were discovered and sobbed in the street. She was assured that her aunt, who lives next door, was safe.
“I thought it was someone I knew,” she said as she walked away from the home, her hands shaking.
Campbell said she knew the neighbors who lived in the home where the bodies were found and described them as grandparents who lived with their grandson.

Why epic California rains might not prevent a dangerous fire season ahead,https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2023-01-31/will-recent-storms-save-califonia-from-a-brutal-fire-season,2023-01-31,"It’s something of a Golden State paradox: Dry winters can pave the way for dangerous fire seasons fueled by dead vegetation, but wet winters —like the one the state has seen so far— can also spell danger by spurring heaps of new growth that can later act as fuel for flames.
Experts say it’s too soon to know  with certainty what the upcoming fire season has  in store. The atmospheric rivers  that pounded California in January have left the state snow-capped and  wet, which could be a fire deterrent if soils stay damp. But if no more rains arrive — or if other, less predictable factors such as lightning storms and heat waves develop later in the year — all that progress could go out the window.
“The dice are loaded for a weak fire season, but there are multiple things that could cause it to go the other way,” said Park Williams, a bioclimatologist at UCLA.
California
After January storms, the California Department of Water Resources raises its allocation to state water agencies to 30% from 5% only two months ago.
There’s no question the recent rains offered some relief. The storms moved most of Californiaout of the extreme drought categoriesin which it has been mired for more than three years, and portions of the Sierra Nevada are still buried under multiple feet of snow.
But lower-elevation areas could be at risk, Williams said. That includes the hills around Los Angeles and the foothills of the Sierra Nevada and northern coastal ranges, which are bursting with new grasses that can easily dry out.
“This year, we’ve loaded up the ground with a whole bunch of new vegetation, and so in summertime — as long as the summer is hot and dry — the probability of grass fires is probably higher this year than normal,” he said.
Capt. Robert Foxworthy, a spokesman for the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection, said he was so far “optimistic” about the season in higher-elevation areas, where  the month ended  wetter than in recent years. In 2021, dry conditions paved the way for the Dixie and Caldor fires to become thefirst to ever burn from one side of the Sierra to the other.
“Obviously, the more moisture we get, the better we’re going to be,” Foxworthy said. “The more snowpack we have, the better chance we have of it being a quieter fire season overall.”
But much depends on whether the rest of the wet season brings more rain, he said. Seasonal forecasts arecurrently inconclusive, pointing to equal chances of dryness or wetness in much of California through April.
If no more rain falls, and if temperatures rise and strong winds arrive, “then I think we’ll be in a completely different place come summertime,” he said.
What’s more, moisture is only one ingredient in how fire season develops. Many blazes are triggered by heat, lightning, winds and other factors that are harder to predict in advance.
“I can’t tell you how many people are going to drive down the road dragging a chain behind their vehicle that may start a couple of fires. I can’t tell you if we’re going to geta big lightning outbreak... that’s going to drop 15,000 lightning strikes in two days, starting a bunch of fires,” Foxworthy said.
California
With the worst of fire season behind us, experts say this year’s reduced fire activity has less to do with strategy and more to do with luck.
There are other factors  as well. Many of California’s largest fires in recent years have started during intense heat waves, which are becominghotter, longer and more frequentdue to global warming, increasing their likelihood of contributing to conflagrations, said Williams.
Climate change is also contributing to worseningaridification and evapotranspiration, or the processes by which the state’s atmosphere is becoming thirstier and sapping more moisture from plants and soil.
“The atmosphere is going to be faster to take the water back, because the air is warmer and more arid,” Williams said. “And so this spring, evaporation rates will be higher than they would have been given the same winter storms in a cooler world.”
Also in the mix is the anticipated arrival of El Niño later this year, said Paul Pastelok, senior meteorologist and lead long-range forecaster at Accuweather. El Niño — a warming of sea-surface temperatures in the tropical Pacific — is often associated with wet conditions in the state, especially in Southern California.
Pastelok said an El Niño pattern could pull more moisture into Southern California in fall and winter, potentially holding back the fire season. But its biggest effect would probably be felt next year as it dampens soils and spurs new growth once again.
The main concern for this year is the timing of the dryness, he said. In fact, the wet start to January could simply push the beginning of fire season later.
“What we notice is at higher elevations, these kind of wet, snowy rushes tend to delay the fire season — it tends to get put off until later-than-normal time periods, probably toward the fall,” Pastelok said. “Whereas the lower elevations, it really doesn’t matter much. The soils will dry out quickly, the dry fuels will come on strong as long as there’s no interruptions.”
Climate & Environment
Nearly 17 million acres will fall under the worst ranking from the state fire marshal, a 14.6% increase since the map was last updated in 2007.
Last year’s season also proved how unpredictable fire in the West can be. The state started the year with record dryness, andall signs were pointing to another bad season. Drought-driven fire seasons in 2020 and 2021 broke records, burning 4.4 million and 2.6 million acres, respectively.
That forecastlargely failed to manifest in 2022, with the year delivering one of the weaker seasons in recent memory, 364,000 acres.
That was thanks largely to some well-timed rains that helped dampen burgeoning blazes, as well as a lack of “trigger mechanisms” such as lightning storms and strong wind events, Pastelok said.
Foxworthy, of Cal Fire, said such unpredictability speaks to the challenges of forecasting, especially so early in the year.
“We’re optimistic because all the fuels are going to have more moisture in them, but I can’t say one way or the other because we don’t know what’s going to happen from this point until summer,” he said.

Baby who suffered brain damage to receive $32 million in settlement with Tulare County,https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2023-01-30/tulare-county-california-pays-baby-32-million-settlement,2023-01-31,"In the summer of 2020, a 10-month-old child, identified in court records only as J.G., was admitted to an Orange County hospital and was found to have suffered “profound brain damage due to severe malnourishment.”
J.G. “will likely have the cognitive function of an infant for the rest of his life,” according to a lawsuit filed last year  against Tulare County.
The lawsuit, filed through the child’s grandmother, alleged that the county’s Child Welfare Services program failed to act on multiple reports of child abuse and neglect, resulting in J.G.’s condition and permanent brain damage.
The county settled the suit this month and is due to pay J.G. $32 million in what “is believed to be the largest settlement ever obtained against a child protective services agency by a surviving child of abuse in the state of California,” the plaintiff’s attorney’s said Monday in a news release.
“The system failed,” said lead attorney Brian Panish.
“The overall supervision and management [of the Child Welfare Services program] was very poor,” he said, adding that the program’s systems were “behind the times” and “inadequate.”
As part of the settlement, the agency must implement new policies and software to better track and follow up on reports of abuse.
California
She admitted falling for a man whose embrace she had never known, who lived his days in what he called ‘paseo de la muerte.’ Death row.
Neither Child Welfare Services nor the county responded Monday to a request for comment.
“J.G.’s experience represents one of the worst cases of what happens when Child Welfare Services fails to fulfill its basic obligations,” Panish said in a news release. “There is no amount of money that will restore J.G.’s quality of life and we will never know the life he could have lived if the County had just done its job.”
The agency began receiving referrals regarding J.G. in October 2019, just weeks after the child was born.
J.G.’s biological parents, according to the complaint, do not believe in modern medicine or that diseases are real, and in early 2019 his biological father conceived of a plan to raise an entirely “plant-based” baby.
J.G. was subjected, the complaint says, to a variety of dangerous situations within a week of being born including prolonged “sun baths” followed by ice baths. The father posted photos of these acts online.
On Oct. 9, photos of J.G. that showed him “looking very small, wrinkled, and malnourished” were posted online.
On a single day in March 2020, J.G.’s grandmother called Child Welfare Services 10 times to report J.G.’s malnourishment and neglect.
“None of these calls were documented,” according to the complaint.
California
Tulare County sheriff says detectives are “very close” in their investigation of the Goshen massacre that left six dead, including a teen mother and her baby.
The grandmother called the agency again the following day and spoke with a social services worker about J.G.’s treatment.
Again, the referral was not investigated, and the case was passed on to multiple other social workers.
“From March 2020 to July 31, 2020, J.G.’s health deteriorated. His body was covered in a rash, his extremities were swelling, and he was not gaining weight,” according to the complaint.
J.G.’s parents were feeding the infant primarily blended bananas and dates with honey. He was not being breastfed or given formula.
On July 31, J.G. was taken by his parents on a vacation to Costa Mesa. The following morning, J.G. was unresponsive and eventually hospitalized at an Orange County hospital.
The child protection agency in Orange County opened an investigation, and on Aug. 4 the Tulare County Child Welfare Services were notified of J.G.’s condition.
Orange County Child Protective Services took custody of J.G., and felony child endangerment charges were filed against the parents by the Orange County district attorney.
After spending time in a foster home, J.G. was placed in the custody of his grandmother.
“She’s his guardian angel,” Panish said.

"‘Treelogy’ is a sublime, classical ode to California’s redwoods, sequoias and Joshua trees",https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/story/2023-02-27/review-treeology-soraya-classical-music-redwoods-sequoias-joshua-trees,2023-02-27,"Ask not what trees can do for music. That’s much too obvious. Trees have made music, as pretty much most of the world knows it, possible. We bless them for having given us so many of our instruments and listening spaces. Would we have recorded music were it not for the wood that made loudspeaker cabinets?
“Treelogy: A Musical Portrait of California’s Redwood, Sequoia and Joshua Trees” features three new “tree” pieces by composers from California. Given their first performances at the Soraya on Thursday night, the works ask, instead, what music can do for trees.  They arrive at a crucial moment, as for the first time in their centuries-old lives, a great many of our state’s enduring majestic residents face an existential threat from wildfires.
We’ve changed the climate. Now what? Can three splendid pieces of music, inspired by trees, save our state? Of course not. But the real value of “Treelogy” is subliminal. Trees inspire art. Art serves to enhance awareness. Awareness saves the day.
Trees have always been welcome in classical music. No trees means no leafy springtime branches to start off Vivaldi’s eternal “The Four Seasons.” Opera without trees as settings is unthinkable. In order to transform a mythological nymph into a tree, Richard Strauss ended his opera “Daphne” with a transcendental musical photosynthesis that mimics the mystical sensation of standing under a redwood. Want to become one with nature? Bond with a tree.
Strauss has a full opera to prepare you for this epiphany. Billy Childs, Gabriella Smith and Steven Mackey, each commissioned by the Soraya to write a 25-minute piece for the string ensemble Delirium Musicum, don’t have anything like that opportunity. They didn’t even get program notes, only two-minute Vimeo video introductions linked to a physical or digital one page program sheet.
The new scores were played in front of large projected photos of the trees by  Max Whittaker, a New York Times freelancer. Otherwise, the pieces were left to speak for themselves. Had they been heard outside the “Treelogy” conceptual umbrella and with different titles, the scores  wouldn’t exactly scream trees.
But then again, we surround ourselves with the bounty of trees without thinking. And for a couple of hours, we thought trees. That’s stayed with me long enough to feel new gratitude for the wooden desk on which I’m typing.
Childs’“My Roots Spread Far and Wide”easily makes the communication between his improvisational jazz trio and his more formal material for the virtuosic and versatile Delirium strings. Listening to it is as gratifying as tree roots reaching out to different plant species in the forest. The piece itself, though, gave the impression of what it  felt like to be  with a giant sequoia in its own environment. One thing doesn’t necessarily have to lead to another in a freewheeling forest.
If the full ensemble’s melodies and rich harmonies could be heard as the trunk, then Childs let the leaves fall where they  might in his complex and surprising piano improvisations. Root-like, the other members of Childs’ trio — Dan Chmielinski on bass and Christian Euman on drums — reached out in their solos, engaging in a contrapuntal sense with various Delirium players.
Gabriella Smith, who will have a major Los Angeles Philharmonic premiere in May, went to Joshua Tree National Park and recorded the sounds of the ecosystem in which the desert’s namesake trees have long thrived. Her“Desert Ecology,”in five sections, might be likened to 21st century Vivaldi. Like Vivaldi, she is a string player herself and fancies sound effects.
The middle movement, “Sofia,” for instance, starts out sounding like a hipster driving too fast on Twentynine Palms Highway. There is a thump, thump, thump in the vibrant strings. A Vivaldi-esque pulse turns into something more in the vein of Michael Nyman doing a Minimalist take on Purcell. Smith uses microtonal runs to do what bushy Joshua trees do to the landscape, namely make it weird. It is as though desert winds and dry heat re-tuned violin strings.
Smith  takes not only her trees seriously but also the sound of Delirium‘s strings. In her delirious desert landscape, she shares a joy of place and aural sensations. This exciting  young ensemble is a step ahead, ready for anything. It has a new recording of Vivaldi’s “Four Seasons” via Hans Richter and Philip Glass’ “The American Seasons” coming out next month.
Steve Mackey’s“Red Wood” takes root, so to speak,  in the way  trees pass life-giving materials underground to sustain the health of the forest. A double concerto for Mackey on electric guitar, violinist and Delirium leader Etienne Gara and strings, it also reflects on the equally impressive phenomenon of fairy rings, the name for the redwoods growing in circles that are sustained by the roots of  fallen trees.
In a beautifully conceived score that flows with a kind of natural ease, the guitar  electrifies acoustic strings while somehow sharing kinship. Whether or not one hears trees in this, and I didn’t, is hardly the point. Mackey celebrates how trees make him feel and makes you want to feel that way too.
A project of California State University, Northridge, home of the Soraya, “Treelogy” travels to the Cal State  campuses in Chico on Tuesday and  Sonoma on Thursday. The project, though, needs, like our trees, a long life, beginning with a radio broadcast or live stream of one of the performances and then a studio recording. That’s the least we can do for our trees.

Southern California dries out after latest storm. But how long will rain go away?,https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2023-03-30/southern-california-dries-out-after-latest-storm-but-how-long-will-rain-go-away,2023-03-30,"A soggy week in Southern California will end with sunny skies and warmer weather — but for how long?
The National Weather Service warned that the Los Angeles areacould see thunderstormswith brief heavy rain, small hail, gusty winds and lightning Thursday afternoon before the latest storm leaves the area.
Dry conditions with a warming trend are expected Friday and into the weekend, with high temperatures on Saturday reaching the lower 70s.
What happens next is not yet certain: Models show thatyet another storm systemcould make its way down the center of the state around Monday, delivering showers and low-elevation snow to the mountains and interior areas, along with cooler temperatures across the Southland.
However, valleys and coastal areas may be spared more precipitation, said Mike Wofford, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service in Oxnard.
“Right now for the L.A. area, it looks like just a super small chance of rain, and if it does it’d be really light,” he said.
California
A Ventura County high school closed after a car fell into a sinkhole in front of campus. Other sinkholes appeared at Cal State Los Angeles and in L.A.
Instead of coming in from the ocean, the “inside slider” storm would stay more inland, so it doesn’t have as much moisture to work with, Wofford said.
“With these kinds of situations, sometimes we’ll see rain or precipitation in the northern part of the state, the mountains, the Sierra Nevada, maybe down to some of our local mountains in the interior, but it’s not really a favorable situation for rain getting down into the L.A. Basin area,” he said.
The stretch of dryness comes after the latest storm made a mess of conditions in several areas. Saturated soils, soaked with yet more rain, began to give way to landslides and sinkholes along freeways, including a portion of the 5 Freeway near Castaic and the 710 Freeway in Pasadena.
Sinkholes are formed when water or erosion makes cavities beneath the surface of the land, causing it to eventually collapse or depress. The state hasseen a spate of sinkholesdue to the recent rains.
A sinkhole was discovered on the southbound 710 freeway off-ramp to California Blvd. The off-ramp has been fully closed and traffic is being diverted to the Del Mar Blvd. off-ramp until temp repairs will allow single lane access. Full repairs will be completed on or before 4/4.pic.twitter.com/1WMMTMJCTb
“All of these are from the relentless rains — the soil has been undermined with water and it’s starting to slide now,” said California Department of Transportation spokesman Marc Bischoff.
The sinkhole near Castaic — located along the 5 Freeway about 2 miles north of Templin Highway — resulted in partial lane closures in both directions, with no estimated time of reopening. Aerial footageshowed a widening holeas a portion of the freeway crumbled to pieces and slid down a hill.
Bischoff said geotechnical crews will evaluate the situation and make a plan for repair. “At some point, we’re going to have to remove that soil and then rebuild the slope,” he said.
In Pasadena, a smaller hole developed Wednesday on the southbound side of the 710 Freeway at the California Boulevard offramp, the Pasadena Police Department said.
City Councilman Steve Madison, whose district represents the area, said crews were working on a temporary repair that will allow single-lane access, but that full repairs probably won’t be completed until next week.
We have#AtmosphericRiversto thank for all this recent rain! 🌧️ The team from@CW3E_Scrippssays we are at 31 atmospheric river events so far this water year (11 weak, 13 moderate, 6 strong, 1 extreme). Here is the map of where and when they all hit. ⬇️pic.twitter.com/tbh3egHnb8
Meanwhile, crews blocked offa portion of Wrightwood Drivein Studio City on Thursday morning after a torrent of mud tumbled onto the roadway. The Los Angeles Fire Department reported similar issues during the storm, including amudflow on Beverly Crestthat was cleared Wednesday.
Caltrans on Thursday was also repairing a section of State Route 33 from Matilija Hot Springs Road to Lockwood Valley Road in Los Padres National Forest, which is closed until further notice “due to extensive storm damage.”Video shared by the agencyshowed trucks moving large boulders and piles of dirt from the roadway.
The right shoulder of the southbound Pacific Coast Highway is also closed from Topanga Boulevard to Coastline Drive in Malibu as Caltrans prepares to repairdamage to the beachside slopeby constructing a wall of boulders, the agency said.
The rain has also affected beaches, as stormwater can wash bacteria, chemicals, debris, trash and other hazards from city streets and mountain areas into the ocean. The L.A. County Public Health Department hasextended a beach water use advisoryuntil 9 a.m. Saturday, cautioning that “elevated bacteria levels in ocean water may cause illness, especially in children and the elderly.”
The latest storm dropped even more rain and snow on a state that has been pummeled by cold, wet weather for months. The Center for Western Weather and Water Extremes said it has recorded31 atmospheric river eventsin California since the end of last year, including 11 weak, 13 moderate, six strong and one  extreme storm.
While the stormseased drought conditions considerably, they also contributed to dozens of deaths, floods and infrastructure challenges for residents across the state. Angelenos used to sunnier, drier conditions are likely to see a return to form, at least for a little while.
“There’s really no strong signals for any sort of precipitation going all the way through like the middle of April,” Wofford said. “It does look like the odds are that we’re going to be in a fairly long dry stretch after this one.”

Two weeks until California slashes rooftop solar incentives,https://www.latimes.com/environment/newsletter/2023-03-30/two-weeks-until-california-slashes-rooftop-solar-incentives-boiling-point,2023-03-30,"This story originally published in Boiling Point, a weekly newsletter about climate change and the environment.Sign up hereto get it in your inbox.
It’s been nearly a decade since California lawmakers ordered the state’s Public Utilities Commission to revamp a rooftop solar incentive program called net metering. In two weeks, we’ll finally begin to see the consequences of that decision.
After 11:59 p.m. on Friday, April 14, most Californians who want to put panels on their roofs will no longer have access to the same incentives that have helpedmore than 1.6 millionhomes and businesses go solar. Instead, they’ll be faced with a far less generous incentive program known as net billing, which will result in lower savings on monthly electricity bills.
Iwrote last yearabout why state officials decided to slash solar payments. It boils down to the idea that monopoly utilities such as Southern California Edison don’t collect as much money from homes with solar, forcing them to charge more to lower-income customers who can’t afford solar. Rooftop installers and many clean energy activists reject that claim as wildly exaggerated.
The rooftop solar industry lost the argument. Now it’s time to study what happens next.
EnergySage, a company that helps consumers compare rooftop solar bids from vetted contractors, released someuseful datathis month after surveying 35 installers. Nearly three-quarters said the new incentive program would significantly harm the California solar industry, with 90% expecting some amount of harm. Just one survey respondent said it would help the industry.
More optimistically, solar companies told EnergySage they expect the number of customers who install a battery alongside their rooftop panels to rise from 19% to 71%. Two-thirds of respondents said they plan to invest more in energy-storage sales.
That should be welcome news to Gov. Gavin Newsom’s appointees on the Public Utilities Commission, who said one of their goals in lowering incentive payments for standalone solar systems was toencourage homes and businesses to add batteries.
But overall, installers painted a bleak picture of where the market is headed.One in five solar companies said they plan to slow hiring. Nearly three in five said they’re less confident in the industry’s future in the state than they were a year ago.
EnergySage CEO Vikram Aggarwal told me he expects solar installations to fall by half.
“This is bad. In America, with capitalism, we’re very much used to growing year after year,” he said.
The reduced solar payments won’t affect homes that already have rooftop systems in place, or customers of government-run electric utilities such as the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power. But the majority of Californians are served by the big investor-owned utilities regulated by the utilities commission: Edison, Pacific Gas & Electric and San Diego Gas & Electric.
If there’s any saving grace for the solar industry, it’s that business has been gangbusters the last few months.
EnergySage says the number of Californians buying solar through its digital marketplace has increased by more than 500% this quarter, as homes and businesses rush to qualify for the stronger incentive program before it goes away. My own reporting bears that out. I talked this week with leaders of several installers across the state, all of whom told me their employees are scrambling to keep up with unprecedented demand and get photovoltaic panels on roofs before the April 14 deadline.
“Our people are working around the clock,” said Mark Figearo, chief executive of Green Convergence in Santa Clarita.
The surge in installations has created challenges — including for the monopoly electric utilities.
Before a home or business can power up its solar panels and connect to the grid, it must file an “interconnection request” with its electric utility. For many Californians, getting those requests approved has been slow as utilities grapple with the large increase in applications. Edison has told customers it may take up to 20 business days to review their requests.
The delays have left installers worried about what will happen in cases where utilities reject a request as incomplete or containing errors.Homes and businesses have until April 14 to submit their paperwork — but what if Edison or PG&E issues a rejection on April 15? Or on April 12, leaving too little time for the solar installer to correct and resubmit the request? Will families who signed solar contracts under the expectation of net metering find themselves stuck with the weaker incentives?
Vincent Battaglia, chief executive of Renova Energy in the Coachella Valley, told me he’s set a deadline of March 31 to submit requests to Edison, out of fear the utility will scour the paperwork for small, insignificant mistakes to try to limit the number of people who can qualify for net metering and secure years of higher payments for the solar electricity they produce.
“They’re kind of making the rules up as they go, which leads me to be suspicious,” Battaglia said.
Brad Heavner, policy director at the California Solar & Storage Assn., an industry trade group, told me installers are “on pins and needles right now” about how Edison and the other investor-owned utilities will deal with last-minute paperwork errors. He said the utility companies have ensured the solar industry they’ll allow minor mistakes to be fixed after the April 14 deadline, but they haven’t offered enough guidance on what constitutes a major mistake versus a minor one.
“We’re very nervous. It’s all up to them,” Heavner said. “They could say anything is a major deficiency.”
Asked about those concerns, Edison spokesperson Ron Gales emailed me adetailed listof “major” and “minor” deficiencies. He also told me the processing delays have been caused by the incredible volume of solar applications — 16,000 in January, 24,000 in February and an expected 55,000 in March, compared with an average of 4,000 a month in recent years.
Although Edison staffed up in anticipation of a last-minute surge, “no one predicted this level of volume,” he wrote.
Solar installers in parts of northern and central California served by PG&E described an additional problem: The utility’s website for submitting interconnection requests has been periodically down for maintenance, and occasionally glitching out.
“Recently, we’ve been able to get through the whole application process until we try to pay with a credit card, and the credit card processing has been crashing,” said Barry Cinnamon, chief executive of Bay Area solar installer Cinnamon Energy Systems.
“It’s a hostile bureaucracy. They don’t have any incentive to make the website better,” he added.
When I ran that complaint by PG&E spokesperson Lynsey Paulo, she blamed a “significant increase in traffic,” about three times the typical monthly average to the solar applications page. She said the site “has experienced temporary performance issues just over the last week,” and that “those issues have been quickly resolved.” If there are more problems closer to the April 14 deadline, she said, the company would be lenient with customers submitting last-minute solar connection requests.
Also important: Just because net metering is going away doesn’t mean there’s no financial case for solar anymore.
Aggarwal, the EnergySage CEO, said Texas and Florida have similar solar “payback periods” — the number of years it takes customers to make back their upfront investment — as California is expected to have under the new incentive program. Those states haven’t installed nearly as much solar as this one, but they’re still the country’s second- and third-largest markets.
“Utilities are asking forfurther rate increases, and will continue to ask for further rate increases,” Aggarwal said. “Not everybody will be able to afford [solar]. But as electricity prices go up, solar again will become more affordable.”
Some clean energy advocates are holding out hope that they can keep current incentive levels in place.
In January, three advocacy groups — the Center for Biological Diversity, Environmental Working Group and Protect Our Communities Foundation — filed aformal appealasking the Public Utilities Commission to reconsider its December decision.
The groups argued that commission officials hadn’t complied with the 2013 law requiring them to reevaluate net metering, in part because they’d failed to take into account all the benefits of rooftop solar — such as protecting homes from blackouts and utility power shutoffs, slashing air pollution from fossil fueled power plants in low-income communities, reducing the need for expensive long-distance transmission lines and potentiallylimiting the environmental damage from large solar farms.
The Public Utilities Commission hasn’t yet responded to the appeal.
“We’re hopeful that they do the right thing, and we don’t have to take this to court,” said Roger Lin, an attorney at the Center for Biological Diversity.
This isn’t the only case where the utilities commission has disappointed rooftop solar advocates.
Just last month, commission staffproposedto dismiss an application from Houston-based installer Sunnova to build solar-plus-storage microgrids to power whole neighborhoods, without any involvement from the monopoly utilities. The arguments for and against Sunnova’s plan are complicated. The company says it can offer families a cheaper way to keep the lights on; critics worry its microgrids would raise utility bills for everyone else, or even backfire if the company can’t live up to its obligations.
“Our hope is that the commission recognizes that this is an opportunity for them, and that we don’t bureaucracy ourselves out of innovation and competition,” said Meghan Nutting, Sunnova’s executive vice president for government and regulatory affairs.
Whoever is right, this is another example of state officials grappling with the growing number of people and businesses looking for alternatives to traditional monopoly utilities — and at least so far, choosing to play it slow and cautious.
For Matt Baker, who leads the utilities commission’s ratepayer advocacy office, a totally decentralized power grid isn’t the solution to our climate change and cost problems. But neither is what he called the “one ring” approach of letting utilities do everything (a reference to “one ring to rule them all” from the “Lord of the Rings” trilogy, which my editor insists I need to explain).
Baker supported slashing rooftop solar incentives because he believes doing so will result in lower electricity bills for homes that don’t have solar. He also urged the commission to reject Sunnova’s microgrid application on similar grounds. But he’s convinced we need a lot more rooftop solar, and he sees a role for microgrids too. He thinks the key is to move slowly and carefully.
“It’s all going to be very expensive, unless we try to make sure that things are as cost-based as possible,” he said.
And here’s where we get to the crux of the challenge. California needs to move ridiculously fast to stop burning fossil fuels and limit the damage from climate change, as does the rest of the world.But what’s the right balance between big solar farms, small rooftop systems and other forms of clean energy? And how do we keep power costs from rising so fast that people won’t want to buy or lease electric cars, and replace their gas furnaces with electric heat pumps?
Part of California’s answer was to do away with net metering. Starting in two weeks, we’ll see the results.
On that note, here’s what else is happening around the West:
California lawmakers approved a bill backed by Gov. Gavin Newsom that will give state officials the authority to cap oil-industry profits, if they determine that refiners are ripping off drivers.Details herefrom The Times’ Taryn Luna, who writes that oil companies warn the law could backfire and lead to higher gas prices. Newsom didn’t get everything he wanted, but the bill’s passage wasstill a political winfor the potential presidential contender, Luna and Laurel Rosenhall write. State Sen. Scott Wiener, meanwhile, is once again pushing a bill that would require large companies doing business in California to disclose their carbon pollution. His proposal fellone vote short of passagelast year amid corporate opposition, my colleague Dorany Pineda reports. There are also two bills in Sacramento that would speed approval of new transmission lines, in hopes of making it easier to supply cities with energy from distant solar and wind farms. The Sacramento Bee’s Ari Plachtawrote aboutthose bills.
The U.S. Forest Service is being sued over its use of fire retardant drops, which critics say pollute rivers and don’t actually do much to fight wildfires.The Forest Service strongly disagrees, arguing that retardant is acrucial firefighting toolthat can help slow the spread of flames and give ground crews a fighting chance to contain them, my colleague Alex Wigglesworth reports. Paradise Mayor Greg Bolin — whose town was razed by the Camp fire — is on the federal agency’s side. “This is going to destroy towns and many communities in California, if they allow this to go through,” he said. “To maybe save a few fish, really?”
Long Beach will get $30 million under the federal infrastructure law to move back freeway lanes from elementary schools and expand a public park.Pasadena is getting some money too, with both cities working toaddress the legacyof an abandoned plan to expand the 710 Freeway, LAist’s Erin Stone writes. For background on the 710 battle, seethis storyby The Times’ Rachel Uranga on the environmental justice activists who defeated the expansion plan, which could have resulted in even worse air quality in low-income communities of color. The legacy of freeway construction continues to be a fraught issue nationally. Just last month, after criticism from Republicans, the Biden administrationstopped advising statesto spend federal infrastructure funds with climate change and environmental justice in mind, Aydali Campa and Kristoffer Tigue report for Inside Climate News.
Southern California is refilling its largest reservoir — a good sign for water supplies following record storms.The Times’ Hayley Smith wrote about thedramatic turn of eventsat Diamond Valley Lake, and about Gov. Gavin Newsom’s decision toroll back drought restrictionssuch as limits on outdoor watering. The governor was motivated by extraordinary snowpack, including arecord 286% of averagein the southern Sierra Nevada, as my colleague Terry Castleman reports. But Newsom stopped short of declaring the drought over — to the annoyance of Times columnist George Skelton, whowrote, “When government doesn’t level with people and they know it, they become even more cynical and tune out officials trying to lead them.”
The largest freshwater lake west of the Mississippi River is back in full force, drowning towns and farmland.My colleagues Ian James and Susanne Rust have theharrowing taleof Tulare Lake’s return to California’s San Joaquin Valley. It’s a reminder that getting so much water all at once — an event made more likely by climate change — is not all good. Same withthis gripping storyby Louis Sahagún, about the L.A. Department of Water and Power’s frantic efforts to repair the Los Angeles Aqueduct after it was damaged by epic floods. Then there’s the continued heartbreak in the farmworker community of Parajo, where childrencan’t go back to schoolafter terrible floods, as The Times’ Melissa Gomez reports. Newsom promised to request federal aid for the town, but it took him nearly two weeks. Why? Rust and Ruben Vivesexplored the reasonsfor the delay.
Should there be a United Nations-led negotiation process for protecting our planet’s shared water resources, like there is for our shared climate?That was one idea floated at the U.N.’s first global water conference in 46 years. Ian Jameswrote about the discussions, which were hugely relevant to California and the West. “Water is in deep trouble,” U.N. Secretary-General António Guterres said. “We are draining humanity’s lifeblood through vampiric overconsumption and unsustainable use, and evaporating it through global heating. We’ve broken the water cycle, destroyed ecosystems and contaminated groundwater.”
Electric vehicles are far more prevalent in parts of California that are at least 75% white and Asian, with wealthier, more educated residents.That’s according to anew analysisfrom CalMatters’ Nadia Lopez and Erica Yee, and although it’s not exactly surprising, it underscores the need for policies that do more to help lower-income Californians — including many people of color — make the switch to electric. I also learned a lot fromthis storyby Jessica Kutz at The 19th, examining some of the reasons men are more likely to drive EVs than women — including the safety risk involved in spending a lot of time waiting at remote or out-of-the-way changing stations. We definitely need a lot more chargers in convenient locations; as E&E News’ David Ferris wrote in arecent pieceabout a Western road trip, “The electric road trip isn’t debugged, scaled up or ready for mass adoption.”
What’s more important to Americans: Protecting natural lands and wildlife, or quickly building out renewable energy projects to reduce climate pollution?In a new national poll commissioned by Heatmap, a whopping 79%chose conservation over clean energy, Robinson Meyer wrote. That’s a crucial dynamic to understand as badly needed solar farms and wind turbines face opposition from conservationists and nearby residents, a topic that — stop me if you’ve heard this one — I’ve been covering as part of ourRepowering the Westseries. I explored a specific example in last week’s Boiling Point newsletter, which dealt with a renewable energy companythreatening to sue the Biden administrationover protections for an endangered toad.
Solar power towers are not yet dead — at least not according to the U.S. Department of Energy, which broke ground last month on a pilot project in New Mexico seeking to jump-start concentrating solar technology.Here’s the storyfrom Emma Foehringer Merchant at Heatmap. If you’re familiar with concentrating solar, it may be because you’ve seen the giant towers just north of the 15 Freeway between Los Angeles and Las Vegas, which are so bright at the top it’s hard to look at them. That project, known as Ivanpah, has hadall sorts of problems. So has the nation’s other major power-tower project,Crescent Dunesin Nevada. But supporters say the technology still holds great potential in its ability to store solar power for after dark.
Work has begun on a long-awaited plan to tear down four dams on the Klamath River in Northern California and Oregon — the largest dam removal project in U.S. history.Here’s the latestfrom Jackson Guilfoil at the Eureka Times-Standard, who writes that the dams should be gone by the end of 2024. For more context, seethis pieceby my colleague Hayley Smith, who explained how the dam removal is “paving the way for hundreds of miles of native fish habitat along the California-Oregon border to flow freely for the first time in more than a century.” The project hasn’t resolved all water disputes in Klamath Basin, though. Just last week, the Yurok Tribe and the Pacific Coast Federation of Fishermen’s Associationssued the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation, arguing the agency has left illegally low amounts of water in the Klamath River, per Sage Alexander at the Times-Standard.
Representatives of the grass-roots group Apache Stronghold were in Pasadena last week, trying to persuade an appeals court to block an Arizona copper mine that they say would destroy Oak Flat, one of the Apache people’s most sacred sites.The Arizona Republic’s Debra Utacia Krolwas at the hearing, and wrote about what the judges had to say. This is one of a growing number of conflicts involving mining proposals that could support the clean energy transition but face opposition due to their environmental and cultural impacts. We may be able to avoid at least some of those conflicts thanks to the federal infrastructure law. Writing for Grist, Maddie Stone explained that the 2021 lawoffered a sixfold funding increasefor a U.S. Geological Survey program to map critical minerals across the country — possibly including low-conflict deposits we haven’t found yet.
Should the federal government ban permanent climbing anchors in wilderness areas without a permit, like they did in Joshua Tree National Park last year?I’m fascinated by the arguments for and against, as laid out inthis storyby the Colorado Sun’s Jason Blevins. Critics say the proposal could turn climbers — traditionally wilderness allies — into conservation foes.
I haven’t paid much attention to Republican efforts to pass a sweepingpro-fossil fuel energy billin the House of Representatives, because there’s essentially zero chance the legislation is approved by the Senate and reaches President Biden’s desk.
But another House Republican proposal caught my attention. This one is a resolution urging the Biden administration to halt approval of new offshore wind projects until more study can be conducted into their environmental impacts. The resolution’s backers cite a recent spate of whale deaths along the East Coast, which they blame on the offshore wind industry.
Here’s the thing: As Inside Climate News’ Kristoffer Tigueexplains, there is currently no science whatsoever linking the whale die-off to wind energy. It would make little sense, since there are currently no offshore wind farms under construction. Scientists told Tigue that the best evidence so far points to ship collisions and entanglement in fishing gear as the most likely culprits.
So what’s going on here? It seems pretty straightforward that the half-dozen Republican politicians behind this resolution are looking for an excuse to block a renewable energy source they don’t like. It’s pretty brazen, especially considering their staunch support for offshore oil and gas drilling that experts say doesfar more damageto the environment and human health.
If you’re looking for something real to worry about in our coastal waters, my colleague Rosanna Xia wrote about startling new research finding that deposits of DDT along the ocean floor off the Southern California coastaren’t breaking down as expectedand may be moving across the undersea food web. The story is Xia’s latest missive on the toxic chemical, following hereye-opening 2020 deep dive(puns intended).

Skeletal remains found at Lake Mead belong to man who drowned in 1974,https://www.latimes.com/world-nation/story/2023-03-29/lake-mead-human-remains-found-donald-p-smith-drowning,2023-03-30,"Human remains found at Lake Mead in October have been identified as those of a North Las Vegas man who drowned in 1974, Clark County officials said.
The skeletal remains of Donald P. Smith, 39, were discovered in multiple locations at Lake Mead on Oct. 17 and 19, Stacey Welling, a Clark County spokesperson, said in a news release. The death was determined to be accidental by the Clark County coroner’s office, according to officials.
“The identification was based on DNA analysis and reports from the original incident,” officials said.
Climate & Environment
As Lake Mead shrinks after almost two decades of severe drought, accumulated items on the lakebed are being exposed.
Four sets of remains, including Smith’s, were found at the lake last year amid historically low water levels.
On May 1,the remains of a malewho died of a gunshot wound in what the coroner’s office deemed a homicide were found in a barrel at Hemenway Harbor. The person is still unidentified, but he may have been killed between the mid-1970s and early 1980s, according to the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department.
Six days later, theskeletal remains of Thomas Erndt, 42, were found near Callville Bay. His drowning was reported on Aug. 2, 2002, but the coroner’s office has yet to determine the cause and manner of death.
California
The latest discovery in Lake Mead’s receding waters comes less than a week after a body in a barrel was discovered.
In July and August, the remains of an unidentified man were found near the shoreline of Boulder Beach. Some of the remains were found by park visitors.
The coroner’s office continues to attempt to identify the remains but noted that DNA and other forms of identification can be affected by the elements.
“The process for identifying the remains includes examinations to determine the gender and approximate age, height and weight of each decedent; the collection of DNA samples, the quality of which can be greatly affected by time and environmental conditions,” Clark County officials said.

Wildfires in Anchorage? Climate change sparks disaster fears,https://www.latimes.com/world-nation/story/2023-04-30/wildfires-in-anchorage-climate-change-sparks-disaster-fears,2023-04-30,"ANCHORAGE —Research on a flat spot for air evacuations. Talk of old-style civil defense sirens to warn of fast-moving wildfires. Hundreds of urban firefighters training inwildland firefightingtechniques while snow still blankets the ground.
This is thenew realityinAlaska’s largest city,where a recent series of wildfires near Anchorage and the hottest day on record have sparked fears that awarming climatecould soon meanserious, untenable blazesin urban areas — just like in the rest of the drought-plaguedAmerican West.
The risk is particularly high in the city’s burgeoning Anchorage Hillside neighborhood, where multimillion dollar homes have pushed farther and farther up steep slopes and to the forest’s edge. Making the challenge even greater is that many of these areas on the Hillside — home to about 35,000 people — have but one road in and out, meaning that fleeing residents could clog a roadway or be cut off from reaching Anchorage at all.
The prospect of a major wildfire there keeps Anchorage Fire Chief Doug Schrage awake at night when conditions are hot and dry.
“I’ve characterized this as probably the single largest threat to the municipality of Anchorage,” he said.
World & Nation
A police manhunt is continuing for a Texas man who is accused of shooting his neighbors after they asked him to stop firing off rounds in his yard.
Schrage’s city fire department is adept at fighting blazes in buildings. But as Anchorage has grown, the available land is higher up, where wild and urban areas intersect, and those fires are very different from what his firefighters are trained to combat.
The city also has limited wildfire equipment, and it’s nearly impossible to get a fire engine up some switchback roads to homes nestled high up mountains.
“Our strategy is basically to put as many resources as we have on duty on a small fire so that we can keep it contained” while waiting for assistance from the Alaska Division of Forestry and Fire Protection, Schrage said.
This spring, 360 city firefighters are training on wildland firefighting tactics like using water hoses to create a line around the perimeter of a fire and the city is encouraging homeowners to participate in a program to identify hazards like brush and old trees that would feed a fire before it’s too late. In one hilly neighborhood, a community council is researching locations for a makeshift helipad that could be used for air evacuations.
That same small neighborhood with but one road in and out has also discussed installing sirens to warn residents on the city’s wooded fringes of fire danger and hopes to build a database of all residents for emergency communications.
“As much as you wouldn’t want to do it ... it’s like rolling the dice on being alive or dead,” said Matt Moore, who fled his home in 2019 lest he be trapped on the wrong side of the flames on the single road.
Such precautions — common in parched and fire-prone stateslike CaliforniaandColorado— are relatively new in Anchorage in the face of increased fire risk fueled by global warming. The city reached 90 degrees Fahrenheit four years ago, the city’s hottest temperature on record, and it’s had five significant wildfires over the last seven years that were all extinguished before causing much damage.
Still, the U.S. is headed into an El Niño year this season, which traditionally means a bigger fire year and further raises concerns, said Brian Brettschneider, a climate scientist with National Weather Service, Alaska Region.
More than 4,844 square milesburned statewide last year— an area just under the size of Connecticut.
Since 1950, there have been 14 years in which more than 4,687 square miles — the equivalent of 3 million acres — have burned during Alaska’s short but intense fire season. Half of those fire seasons have occurred since 2002, including the worst year on record — 2004 — when more than 10,156 square miles burned.
From his home high above Anchorage in 2019, Moore saw the black smoke billowing from a fire miles away in a heavily wooded area of the city. He gathered his pets and important papers in his vehicle — his wife was already safe in Anchorage — and drove 5 miles  down the only road serving the roughly 600 neighborhood residents to safety.
“Thankfully, they started getting it under control,” he said.
For now, both the city and Schrage’s fire department are focused on keeping things under control — implementing as many preventative measures as possible.
The city department has removed evergreen trees and reduced brush in strips of 100 feet  next to neighborhoods to help contain any future fires and Anchorage has cleared trees and other hazards in parks and along greenbelts.
Firefighters have also conducted inspections at people’s homes to identify fire hazards such as firewood kept too close to their homes or too much vegetation on their property — all in hopes of preserving homes, livelihoods and the community in a time of growing climate uncertainty.

Man who allegedly chomped off part of LAPD officer’s finger is ID’d,https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2023-04-27/lapd-officer-has-finger-bitten-off-during-metro-fracas,2023-04-28,"Los Angeles police Friday identified a 36-year-old man arrested on suspicion of biting off a portion of an officer’s finger on the Metro Red Line during a combative arrest.
Ephraim Okorie was accused of mayhem and resisting an executive order and was booked into jail on $100,000 bail, the Los Angeles Police Department said in a statement.
The incident occurred around 10:15 p.m. Thursday at an unidentified Red Line station when officers saw a man board a train allegedly carrying drug paraphernalia.
The officers took the man off the train,  according to the LAPD, and he became violent and fought the officers. A portion of a sergeant’s finger was bitten off in the fracas, and officers used force to detain him.
The injured officer  was not identified.
The suspect received minor injuries and was taken to a  hospital.
California
Commuters have abandoned large swaths of a Los Angeles Metro train system plagued by crime and the scourge of drugs.
In a statement, Los Angeles Police Chief Michel Moore said he was “deeply disturbed by the vicious and gruesome attack” on the sergeant and his police colleagues who “were simply conducting routine patrol of the transit line.”
“We remain committed to our work each day to improve the safety of the entire transit system with dedicated patrols engaging those who pose a risk to the safety of others” the statement said.
California
On the heels of sordid revelations about police behavior, the city of Antioch and its Police Department have been named as defendants in a lawsuit alleging police brutality and racial discrimination.
Twostabbings at Red Line stationsin recent weeks reignited concerns about passenger safety on the system. The line runs between downtown and North Hollywood.
According to its annual crime report, Metro has seen a dramatic increase in violent crimes, with a 24% increase in aggravated assault, robbery, rape and murder from 2021 to 2022. The Red Line had nearly twice as many violent crimes, 687, as the next line, Blue, the report said.
At the same time, ridership has plummeted on Metro rail in recent years. Overall commuter numbers rose 12% last year, compared with 2021, but the 57 million estimated train riders were still far below the 93 million reported in 2019, according to Metro. Ridership on the Red Line in particular was 56% of pre-pandemic levels.

L.A.’s water lifeline faces unprecedented flood threat. The battle to prevent calamity,https://www.latimes.com/environment/story/2023-04-27/flood-fears-los-angeles-aqueduct-rising-temperatures,2023-04-27,"OLANCHA, Calif. —More than a month after heavy storms eroded a section of the Los Angeles Aqueduct, work crews are still scrambling to complete repairs and shore up flood defenses in the face of a weeklong heat wave that threatens to triggerwidespread snowmelt in the Sierra Nevada.
“We’re doing as much as we can, as quickly as possible,” said Paul Liu, of the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power. “Our crews are working 12-hour shifts.”
Historic snowpack levels in the Eastern Sierra are expected to melt into runoff that is 225% of normal, which translates to about 326 billion gallons of water that will need to be managed, DWP officials said.
And while a typical runoff season in the region can last from May to June, this year’s “could push through to August,” said Anselmo Collins, senior assistant general manager of the DWP’s water system.
The DWP has already begun emptying reservoirs to create more storage space for the roughly 130 billion gallons of water expected to make its way to Los Angeles this spring and summer via the aqueduct — potentially enough to meet 80% of L.A.’s annual demand.
The hope is that most of the snow on the mountains stays frozen long enough to give DWP, Inyo County, state, and federal disaster officials enough time to prepare for widespread flooding expected when summer temperatures soar.
California
Temperatures across California started to rise Wednesday, but forecasters said the heat wave should be short-lived, with a cold front on the horizon that could limit the worst of snowmelt flooding risks.
L.A.’s water lifeline to the Owens Valley has never before faced such a long-term flood threat. The vulnerability of the century-old system was brought into sharp focus on March 10,when storm flooding destroyed a 120-foot section of the aqueductnear Olancha.
It was the first time in history that the 200-mile aqueduct had been breached by extreme weather, threatening water deliveries to 4 million ratepayers in Los Angeles.
To drain, dry and repair the breach, DWP crews first opened aqueduct floodgates 25 miles to the north.
Those releases, however, transformed the alkaline lake bed into a churning floodplain of corrosive flows that battered diversion systems, chewed through 18 miles of roads and berms, and encroached on pumping stations and high-voltage electrical infrastructure that would take millions of dollars and several years to replace, officials said.
Now, with forecasters predicting the state’s first heat wave of the season, there’s little time to rest for the crews using earthmovers, excavators and cranes to reinforce damaged berms with rocks and boulders, and to surround vulnerable roads and critical infrastructure with K-rail barrier walls.
Adam Perez, manager of the aqueduct, said the DWP is “considering seeking reimbursements from the California Office of Emergency Services to help cover the millions of dollars it took to repair the breach in March.”
Among the infrastructure at stake is $2.5 billion worth of dust control systems the city of Los Angeles has been required to install to fight hazardous dust pollution — an environmental consequence of L.A.’s draining of Owens Lake more than a century ago.
Climate & Environment
The Los Angeles Department of Water and Power is struggling to maintain the city’s Eastern Sierra aqueduct amid continued flooding from snowmelt.
“Most of the repair work will be completed by June,” said Liu, who heads the DWP’s dust control program. “But with all that snow still up there in the mountains, our crews may be out here a lot longer than that.”
It’s not all bad news. The clank and roar of heavy machinery hasn’t deterred tens of thousands of waterfowl, gulls and shorebirds from taking advantage of dozens of square miles of new, inadvertently created wetlands to rest and bulk up on brine flies before completing their migratory journeys to breeding grounds as far north as the Arctic.
But elsewhere in Owens Valley, a gash of high desert between the Sierra Nevada and the White and Inyo mountains, DWP officials and property owners see signs of concern lurking in ponds, lakes, creeks, irrigation canals and fields that are already brimming with snowmelt.
Drought, wildfires, flooding and heavy snow are nothing new in the eastern Sierras. But this year the region is mirroring patterns of extreme weather worldwide.
The April 29 trout season opener at Crowley Lake is typically a spectacle with fishing enthusiasts in boats trolling in every direction.
But as of April 21, the lake was still frozen and the only boating concession on the lake announced that it was “safe to expect delays of at least a week.”
“This is an unprecedented situation,” said Abby Thomason, owner and general manager of Crowley Lake Fish Camp. “We will take things day by day, if the lake thaws, we will open, but we can’t say when that will be.”
Inyo National Forest officials  announced last week that “to protect public and safety, and natural resources,” it was closing several lower-elevation dirt roads “due to storm damage and prediction of spring snowmelt runoff impacting them further.”
“We know everyone is anxious to get outside and start enjoying springtime adventures on the Inyo,” said Scott Kusumoto, acting director of the Inyo National Forest, “and we’re doing everything we can to make repairs and reopen roads as conditions allow.”
The challenge now is to prevent the bounty of Sierra snowmelt expected to course through the aqueduct this spring and summer from overflowing, inundating the lake bed, as well as fields, homes and businesses.
DWP activitieshave elicitedconcernin Owens Valley since the turn of the 20th century, when Los Angeles agents posed as ranchers and farmers to buy land and water rights in the area, then began building an aqueduct to collect and divert water that had sustained Owens Lake for 800,000 years.
California
California’s snowmelt is leading to flooding and erosions. The Central Valley and Yosemite are dangerously affected, but the water can benefit drought-battered farmers.
By 1926, the diversions that began in 1913 had dried up most of Owens Lake, triggering immense wind-blown sheets of powder-fine lung-damaging particles that descended on towns downwind.
Under a court order, the DWP has spent more than $2.5 billion over the last three decades transforming the lake’s grim heritage with dust control projects including shallow flooding that have reduced salty, alkaline toxic dust emissions by nearly 100%.
In what is now hailed as an astonishing accidental ecological success story, brine flies soon returned to the thin sheen of water tinged bright green, red and orange by algae and bacteria. Then came tens of thousands of waterfowl and shorebirds that feed on the brine flies.
In 2018, Owens Lake was designated a Western Hemisphere Shorebird Reserve Network site of international importance, joining an exclusive group of 104 areas between Alaska and the southern end of South America certified for their outstanding numbers of birds.
Last week,  the repair work of utility crews on the lake bed coincided with the eighth annual Owens Lake Bird Festival, which drew more than 100 nature lovers from across the nation.
The event is co-hosted by many of the conservationists who played a large role in holding L.A. accountable for dust storms that descended on a region of dormant volcanoes, spiky lava fields, craggy mountains and cascading creeks.
On a recent morning, Owens Valley botanist Mike Prather, who helped organize the bird festival, scanned a flooded northern portion of the lake bed through binoculars, smiled and said, “Wow. It’s a good day for migrating birds.”
“It also looks like the DWP is doing a pretty good job of protecting its investments,” he added, “as well as the wildlife here.”

PG&E reaches $50-million settlement with Shasta County in 2020 Zogg fire,https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2023-05-31/pge-reaches-50-million-zogg-fire-settlement-shasta-county,2023-06-02,"Pacific Gas & Electric Co. will pay $50 million in a legal settlement with Shasta County for its role in causing the 2020 Zogg fire, which tore through several rural Northern California communities, killing four people and burning more than 56,000 acres.
As part of the settlement agreement, which awaits final approval by a judge, criminal charges against PG&E that were filed by the Shasta County district attorney in 2021 will be dropped.
Thecharges, among them manslaughter and arson, were brought before Judge Bradley Boeckman in a February 2023 preliminary hearing, where he ruled most of the charges shouldproceed to trial. However, a motion filed by PG&E’s legal team caused the charges to be reviewed by a different judge, who issued a tentative ruling overturning Boeckman’s decision.
Despite that tentative ruling, Shasta County Dist. Atty. Stephanie A. Bridgett engaged in several weeks of negotiations withPG&Eand secured the $50-million settlement.
Climate & Environment
As California struggles with an increase in extreme wildfires, researchers are studying exactly what a healthy or fire-resistant forest looks like.
In an interview Wednesday, Bridgett said it was “frustrating and disappointing” that PG&E would not be held criminally liable, but she was glad to have gained additional funding for Shasta County with the settlement.
“I didn’t want to take a risk or gamble with the safety of the community,” Bridgett said. “I wanted to secure things that would be beneficial.”
The settlement includes $45 million earmarked for improving fire safety and emergency preparedness, including firefighter training, a large-animal evacuation center, the hiring of new arson investigators, and vegetation removal to reduce wildfire risk via the Shasta County Fire Prevention Council. The money will also pay for permanent memorials to the four people killed in the Zogg fire.
The settlement’s remaining $5 million will cover a civil penalty to Shasta County. As part of the stipulated judgment, PG&E cannot raise customer rates to cover the settlement costs.
The Zogg fire began on Sept. 27, 2020, after a damaged gray pine fell on a PG&E electric line along Zogg Mine Road. The fire burned 56,388 acres across southwestern Shasta County and northwestern Tehama County, destroying 204 structures before it was fully contained on Oct. 13, 2020.
Four people died in the fire: Karin King, 79; Alaina Mcleod, 45; Felya Mcleod, 8; and Kenneth Vossen, 52.
According to the Shasta County district attorney’s office, PG&E had in 2018 flagged the pine tree that later fell as hazardous and marked it for removal. Among its issues were a large cavity at the tree’s base and no uphill supporting roots, which caused it to lean toward the lines before falling.
In January 2019, a PG&E program manager warned the company’s vice president of electric operations that tree trunks were not being fully inspected on trees that could fall on power lines. Further inspections in 2019 and 2020 failed to result in the removal of the tree prior to its collapse.
April’s tentative ruling by Shasta County Superior Court Judge Daniel Flynn said the multiple inspections performed along Zogg Mine Road were in accordance with the standard of care maintained by PG&E.

The settlement is the latest to be reached between PG&E and parties affected by wildfires.
Patti Poppe,  chief executive of PG&E’s parent corporation, said in a statement that the settlement reflected the company’s commitment to improving fire safety in its service areas.
“I’m grateful that the Shasta County district attorney has agreed to work with us to make her community safer,” she said, “and we look forward to the relationship this agreement creates.”

LAPD found 700 ‘ghost guns’ — now it is getting $5 million,https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2023-05-31/ghost-gun-manufacturer-polymer80-settles-lawsuit-with-los-angeles-for-5-million,2023-06-01,"In 2020, over the course of numerous investigations, the Los Angeles Police Department recovered more than 700 “ghost guns” — weapons often having no serial numbers and built from components sold without background checks by  Nevada-based company Polymer80, according to the Los Angeles city attorney’s office.
Firearms assembled from the company’s components were used in the ambush of two Los Angeles County sheriff’s deputies in Compton in 2020 and in a home invasion and triple murder in Glendale, the city attorney said.
In 2021, Los Angeles filed suit against Polymer80, alleging that the company was selling its kits without conducting background checks, a violation of the federal Gun Control Act.
The kits allow purchasers to buy gun components that are then assembled by buyers.
Now, the company has settled the suit with the city for $5 million and must conform to multiple gun sales standards.
“This settlement holds Polymer80 and its founders accountable, keeps guns out of the hands of prohibited people, makes L.A. neighborhoods safer and will help law enforcement do their jobs,” City Atty. Hydee Feldstein Soto said Tuesday in a news release. “This is an important step toward preventing unnecessary deaths, especially as Congress repeatedly fails to take action.”
It is not the first time that Polymer80 has been sued over  its products.
Last year, Washington, D.C., received a $4-million judgment against the company, which was also barred from selling untraceable firearms in the district. Polymer80 informs customers of the ruling on its website.
The company’s guns were the most common ghost guns recovered by the Los Angeles Police Department between 2020 and 2023, the city attorney’s office said.
The lawsuit was set to go to trial Tuesday, but the company settled instead.
California
Los Angeles County Superior Court Judge Patrick Connolly sought to disqualify a fellow justice from ruling on the resentencing of a convicted cop killer. Legal experts say the move is nearly unprecedented and deeply concerning.
The lawsuit also alleged that Polymer80 misled customers in its advertising by stating that its products were legal to buy and possess because they were not complete firearms.
“But Polymer80’s core products — gun building kits that are quickly and easily assembled into operable weapons — nonetheless fall under the definition of ‘firearm’ under federal law,” the city attorney’s office wrote in its complaint.
As part of the settlement, Polymer80 must pay $4 million in civil penalties, while its two founders must pay a combined $1 million.
Additionally, Polymer80 is prohibited from selling gun kits in the state without serializing parts and performing background checks.
The company is also prohibited from providing assistance to customers attempting to assemble ghost guns in California and cannot advertise that its products are legal.
Polymer80 did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Unprecedented wildfire on Canada’s Atlantic coast still burning after four days,https://www.latimes.com/world-nation/story/2023-05-31/unprecedented-wildfire-on-canadas-atlantic-coast-still-burning-after-four-days,2023-05-31,"HALIFAX, Canada —An unprecedented string of wildfires in Canada’s Atlantic coast province of Nova Scotia continued to burn out of control for a fourth day Wednesday, preventing thousands of evacuees from learning whether their homes have been destroyed.
Fire officials were hoping for a break in the dry, windy weather, but that’s not forecast to happen until Friday night at the earliest.
Halifax deputy fire chief David Meldrum made it clear that none of the 16,000 evacuees from the suburbs around Halifax will be able to return home for now. An additional 2,000 people who fled a much larger uncontained fire in southwestern Nova Scotia also are being kept away from their properties.
Fire officials say an estimated 200 structures, including 151 homes, have been destroyed since the fire started in the Upper Tantallon area on Sunday afternoon. No deaths or injuries have been reported, but “it’s the site of a tragedy,” Meldrum said.
“There’s widespread destruction, and there’s a level of randomness that comes with wildfires when they hit ... where people live. There are properties that are unharmed close to properties that are destroyed. It’s terrible to see. These are people’s homes,” he said.
Meldrum said the   3¼-square-mile fire northwest of the port city’s downtown grew slightly overnight and could flare up again in the warmer than usual weather. Wind gusts from the southwest were expected to reach  15 mph, and the temperature was forecast to rise to about  77 degrees, with the humidity remaining very low, around 20%.
Meldrum said the fire could quickly grow and spread, which is why the Halifax area’s 39-square-mile evacuation zone will remain in place.
Halifax Mayor Mike Savage said that charges will be brought against anyone burning outdoors, and that anyone responsible for starting a wildfire could be required to pay expenses relating to controlling or extinguishing the blaze, along with any related damages. “We are taking a no-tolerance approach,” Savage said.
The much larger fire that forced 2,000 people to flee outside Barrington has grown to almost 77 square miles since it started last weekend, making it one of largest ever recorded in Nova Scotia.
Nova Scotia Premier Tim Houston declared a ban on all travel and activity in wooded areas, and implored people to avoid any activity that could start more fires.
“Don’t be burning right now. No burning in Nova Scotia. Conservation officers reported six illegal burns last night. This is absolutely ridiculous with what’s happening in this province — three out-of-control fires, eight fires yesterday, 12 on Sunday. Do not burn!” Houston said Tuesday. “We have to do what we can to make sure we don’t have new fires popping up.”
Scott Tingley, the forest protection manager in the province’s wildfire management group, said all of these fires were “very likely human-caused.”
“Much of it probably is preventable. Accidents do happen and so that’s why we certainly appreciate the premier’s message,” Tingley said.

The most famous extinction event in the planet’s history is happening again — in Santa Cruz,https://www.latimes.com/science/story/2023-05-31/the-biggest-extinction-event-in-the-planets-history-is-happening-again-in-santa-cruz,2023-05-31,"SANTA CRUZ —As bad days go, it’s hard to top the one 66 million years ago when a space rock the size of Parisslammed into Earthat 45,000 mph.
The heat of impact generated massive fires that annihilated everything around them and sent colossal plumes of pollutants soaring into the atmosphere. Within a day or two, toxic clouds of pulverized rock, sulfate aerosols and wildfire soot had blanketed the planet, blocking all but a tiny fraction of the sun’s energy and bringing photosynthesis to a virtual halt for the only known time in history.
No event before or since has so thoroughly devastated the basic processes that make life possible here. Earth becamea dark, noxious landscapeof dead vegetation littered with charred carcasses of dinosaurs,pterosaursand other creatures.
By the time the Cretaceous-Paleogene, or K-Pg, extinction event was over, about three-quarters of species alive at the time of impact had disappeared forever.
Eventually, the first green shoots of life emerged from the detritus. No one knows exactly when these first buds appeared, but the fossil record tells us what they were: ferns. Lots of them.
Thedinosaurs’ demisegets all the attention, but the survival of plants is at least as important a chapter in the story of the planet. Why did ferns thrive when almost everything else was destroyed? And what could their extraordinary hardiness tell us about how today’s ecosystems might fare after another cataclysm?
Fortunately, “it’s actually not that hard to simulate a mass extinction,” saidEmily Sessa, a plant systematist at the New York Botanical Garden in the Bronx.
That’s exactly what her team is doing.
Sessa is the principal investigator on a NASA-funded project to explore the recovery of ferns in the post-extinction world. By comparing fossil evidence to observations of plants in apocalypse-like conditions, the team hopes to better understand how this humble flora amassed one of the most impressive track records of survival on Earth and how its strength catalyzed recovery of the rest of the planet.
Science & Medicine
Fossil records from North America indicate dinosaurs were still in their prime 66 million years ago, but the asteroid that struck Earth wiped them out anyway.
The work caught the attention of NASA, which has a long-standing interest in understanding the factors that compel evolution and extinction on this planet — and, potentially, on others.
“To understand the response that ferns had to this enormous cataclysm can be very informative,” saidDr. Lindsay Hays, lead program officer for NASA’s Exobiology Research Program. She said she hopes the experiment will offer new insights into how epoch-ending events “can be important drivers for life elsewhere.”
The ambitious study began as a sketch on the back of a cocktail napkin at a hotel bar where Sessa, then a professor of plant systematics at the University of Florida, andJarmila Pittermann, a professor of plant physiology at UC Santa Cruz, were debriefing after a conference. Both shared an academic interest in ferns and knew that NASA was fundingresearch on exobiology, the study of potential life beyond Earth.
Given that the fossil record shows a spike in the distribution of fern spores at a time when hardly anything else had managed to stay alive, the pair wondered what the plants might tell us about what it takes to survive in hostile and unlikely environments. The ferns, it turned out, would indeed have much to tell.
Pittermann and Sessa reached out toRegan Dunn, a paleobotanist at the La Brea Tar Pits, andEllen Currano, a paleobotanist at the University of Wyoming, and asked them to collect samples of early Paleogene rock that might have fossil evidence of the fern spore spike. Dunn and Currano spent a month in the field looking for rocks bearing the telltale stripe of iridium deposits the asteroid strike left on  Earth. They bored samples above and below the line in five locations in New Mexico and Colorado and combed the sites for leaf fossils to find out what kind of ferns existed at the time of impact.
They sent the samples to a specialized commercial laboratory that crushed the rock and dissolved the minerals, leaving behind fern and fungi spores, pollen grains, leaf fragments and other microscopic traces of prehistoric plant life. PaleoecologistJacqueline Gillof the University of Maine helped them analyze it all.
Then it was a matter of comparing the historical evidence against data collected during a real-life reenactment of the K-Pg catastrophe.
That meant creating a post-apocalyptic scenario in a greenhouse on the roof of UC Santa Cruz’s Interdisciplinary Sciences Building.
The 12-by-20-square-foot space was outfitted last summer with roughly 140 plants representative of the late Cretaceous: spiky palms, feathery metasequoia, frilly ferns. Among the ferns was a variety calledBlechnum spicant, also known as a hard fern or deer fern. Versions of this plant were on the planet for nearly 300 million years before the space rock barreled into Earth.
For more than three months, the plants flourished in their one-gallon pots in atmospheric conditions similar to those at the time of the asteroid impact: warm and humid with carbon dioxide levels of 1,000 parts per million, more than twice that of our current atmosphere.
“Happy Cretaceous conditions,” Pittermann said.
Those conditions changed abruptly in late October.
Research specialist Alex Baer painted the greenhouse’s exterior with several coats of whitewash mixed with a hardener to block the sun’s rays and help the coating withstand winter rainstorms. Then he strung tarps and sheets of Mylar over the ceiling to block out any remaining light.
To complete the transformation, Baer slashed the temperature from a balmy 77 degrees Fahrenheit  to 50 degrees and gave the plants regular spritzes of a solution designed to mimic the acid rain believed to have fallen on the post-impact world.
Within a month, what had been a lush collection of foliage looked like a sad gathering of abandoned houseplants.
The deciduous plants entered winter mode and dropped their leaves in the first week, Pittermann said — a surprisingly quick collapse that underscored the swiftness of the K-Pg extinction.
Science & Medicine
The La Brea Tar Pits were recognized as one of the world’s First 100 IUGS Geological Heritage Sites for their stunning Ice Age fossil record.
Others died more drawn-out deaths.
“With theBlechnum, what we saw was more of a cringy, slow loss of the leaves,” Baer said. “It appeared like it was sort of suffering.”
For the record:
2:18 p.m. May 31, 2023An earlier version of this story misidentified the plant that was neither growing nor deteriorating. It was Sequoia sempervirens, or coast redwood, not metasequoia, or dawn redwood.
Some plants showed traces of their ancestors’ resilience in the face of calamity. TheSequoia sempervirens, or coast redwood, entered a sort of plant limbo in the darkness, neither growing nor showing visible signs of decline.
But what about theBlechnum? As the dark phase wore on, its survival seemed uncertain.
Column One
A showcase for compelling storytelling from the Los Angeles Times.
Scientists believe it took anywhere from two years to several decades for daylight and temperature to return to pre-impact levels. Practicality demanded that the research team shorten that timeline. So in mid-April, after about six months of artificial impact winter, the tarps came down, the acid baths stopped and the whitewash was scraped off the glass, an abbreviated version of the Paleogene’s gradual readjustment.
The researchers knew lifecouldreturn after such awful conditions — we wouldn’t be around if it couldn’t. But how long it would take and what recovery would look like remained to be seen.
The first spring-green buds began to emerge alongside the withered brown remains within days of the light’s return. Two weeks later, fern fronds spilled from several pots, and the tiny sequoia and sycamore saplings once again had leaves.
Only theBlechnumseemed not to have weathered the agonizing collapse: When Baer cut a sample for analysis, he could find no trace of healthy rhizome, or fern stem, as the other plants had. On a recent walk through the greenhouse, Baer inspected a pot that contained its dry, apparently lifeless remnants.
Suddenly, Pittermann gasped. There, poking up through the soil, was a tiny green tendril. TheBlechnumhad made it after all, just as its ancestor did 66 million years ago.
Asked whether ferns could be considered the cockroach of the plant world, Pittermann demurred, offering only that they are “resilient.” But they are an exceptionally hardy class of plants.
“They actually have a special type of photoreceptor that flowering plants and other seed plants do not have, so they’re able to photosynthesize in really low light conditions,” Sessa said. Ferns are also tolerant of acidic and nutrient-poor soils, and some species can absorb heavy metals from contaminated soil, in effect cleaning the earth with their presence.
In the wake of a disaster, be it a forest fire or a giant meteor strike, “if they’re able to get in there and start absorbing heavy metals out of the soil and doing their normal sort of processes of living and dying, they’re then going to create new organic matter,” Sessa said. “They basically just act as the first pioneer or colonizer species that are able to get a hold on a devastated kind of landscape and start to bring some life back to it.”
The fossil record suggested this, but the Santa Cruz experiment was the first to show how that actually happened.
While comparing fossilized specimens to analogous living creatures is “an old tradition in paleontology,” no research team has used the method to explore the K-Pg extinction, saidScott Wing, a geologist and curator of paleobotany at the Smithsonian Institution.
“If you want to understand the effects of global devastation on ecosystems and evolution, this is the first chapter in Earth history to turn to,” Wing said. “It is also a great chapter for trying to understand how life recovers over both ecological and evolutionary time.”
Science & Medicine
Accelerating wildfires played a key role in the Great Dying by destroying ecosystems too quickly for plant and animal species to adapt.
Figuring out how ecosystems rebound from catastrophe isn’t just about understanding the planet’s past. The discoveries could help secure its future.
Earth’s inhabitants are not the sitting ducks they were in the late Cretaceous. NASA can see potentially dangerous asteroids coming decades in advance and is developing ways to protect us from those headed our way. Last year, NASA successfullyknocked a moving space object off coursefor the first time, a key step in planetary defense.
But it’s worth knowing what might happen in a worst-case scenario that suddenly triggered such conditions, be it an interloper from outer space or a homegrown nuclear attack. Even if our species was toast, there’s encouraging evidence that life on the planet — especially the fern kind — would find a way to carry on without us.

"Wildfires force thousands to flee, damage scores of homes in Canada’s Nova Scotia",https://www.latimes.com/world-nation/story/2023-05-30/nova-scotia-wildfires-residents-flee-homes-damaged,2023-05-31,"HALIFAX, Canada —A wildfire on Canada’s Atlantic coast has damaged about 200 houses and other structures and prompted the evacuation of 16,000 people, many of whom were eager to return Tuesday to see whether homes and pets had survived.
Firefighters worked through the night to extinguish hot spots in the fire that started in the Halifax area on Sunday, Halifax Deputy Fire Chief David Meldrum said. He said it was too early to give an exact count of homes destroyed, but the municipal government put the toll at about 200 buildings.
Nova Scotia Premier Tim Houston announced the province would be banning all travel and activity in all wooded areas as of 4 p.m. local time. The ban applies to all forestry, mining, hunting, fishing, hiking, camping, off-road vehicle driving and all commercial activity on government lands.
California
Forecasters say portions of California could get a break this wildfire season, but at lower elevations the outlook is uncertain.
“We’re in a very serious situation in this province, and we need to take the steps that we can to protect Nova Scotia,” he told a news conference via a video call from Shelburne, Nova Scotia, where the province’s largest wildfire has been burning since the weekend.
“I wanted to get a sense of the damage here,” the premier said. “It’s extensive. It’s heartbreaking.”
Dan Cavanaugh was among two dozen people waiting Tuesday in a Halifax-area parking lot to learn if their suburban homes had been consumed by the wildfire.
“We’re like everyone else in this lot,” said the 48-year-old insurance adjuster. “We’re not sure if we have a house to go back to or the extent of the damages.”
Police officers were writing down the names of residents and calling people to be escorted to see what had become of their properties.
Sarah Lyon of the Nova Scotia Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals said an eight-member team was preparing to head out into the evacuation zone to retrieve animals left behind.
California
Members of the Southern Sierra Miwuk Nation became the latest Indigenous tribe to watch homes burn despite knowing it could have been avoided.
In all, about 16,000 people have been ordered to leave their homes northwest of Halifax, most of which are within a 30-minute drive of the port city’s downtown. The area under mandatory evacuation orders covers about 38 square miles.
Sonya Higgins said she and more than 40 others waited in a nearby supermarket parking lot to be led into the evacuation area, in hopes of retrieving seven cats from two homes.
Higgins runs a cat rescue operation in Halifax, and she says the pet owners contacting her are “frantic” to find their animals and get them to a safe place.
Earlier in the day, fire officials said that with the return of dry, windy conditions on Tuesday, there could be a “reburn” in the evacuated subdivisions.
The extended forecast is calling for hotter weather on Wednesday and no rain until Friday at the earliest.

"Transformer explodes at Warner Bros. studios in Burbank, causing brief fire",https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2023-06-30/fire-breaks-out-at-warner-bros-studios-in-burbank,2023-06-30,"A transformer exploded Friday at Warner Bros. Discovery studios in Burbank, causing a fire that was quickly extinguished, fire officials said.
The blaze was reported just before 1:40 p.m. at the studio, known for its iconic water tower. Images on social media showed a large plume of black smoke rising into the sky.
Jessica Zacholl, a spokesperson for Warner Bros., said a nearby transformer blew, which caused an electrical fire.
“We were curious as to what was happening, and one of our co-workers saw smoke from that area,” said Roger Rodriguez, who works in the iHeartMedia building down the street. “There was a power surge right as the fire broke out.”

The transformer was adjacent to the Warner Bros. Fire Department, which responded with assistance from the Burbank and Glendale fire departments.
At least two nearby buildings were evacuated as a precaution, and no injuries were reported.
The fire was extinguished by 2:03 p.m. with no damage to buildings, Burbank officials said.

Alaska’s slow start to wildfire season a relief after Connecticut-sized area burned last year,https://www.latimes.com/world-nation/story/2023-06-30/alaskas-slow-start-to-wildfire-season-a-relief-after-connecticut-sized-area-burned-last-year,2023-06-30,"ANCHORAGE —Alaska is off to the slowest start of a wildfire season in three decades — an immense relief after fires scorched nearly enough land to cover Connecticut last year, even threatening remote communities on the tundra.
Thanks to a cool, wet early summer,this year’s fires have burned the equivalent of just 1½ times the size of New York’s Central Park.
“If you were to kind of draw up a recipe for what would be a benign fire season in Alaska, we really have ... checked all those boxes,” said Brian Brettschneider, a National Weather Service climate scientist.
It’s a far cry from last year, when the state burned in ways rarely or never seen.
A lightning fire in southwest Alaska’s Yukon-Kuskokwim Delta, which is largely tundra, threatened two villages and their 700 residents. Another fire prompted the three-week evacuation of part of the tiny city of Anderson; its smoke blanketed Denali National Park and Preserve, one of the state’s premiere tourist spots as home to North America’s highest peak.
That fire claimed a home and several seasonal cabins. The only fatality in last year’s fires came when a pilot died in a helicopter crash while moving equipment to support firefighters.
World & Nation
A recent series of wildfires near Anchorage and the hottest day on record have sparked fears that a warming climate could soon mean serious, untenable blazes in urban areas
The fires consumed 4,844 square miles — slightly less than the size of Connecticut.
This season’s favorable weather is thanks to an upper-level trough of low pressure over the Bering Sea and western Alaska. It’s bringing cooler air, promoting cloud cover and drawing moisture from the Gulf of Alaska, which helps keep plants from drying out, Brettschneider said.
Firefighters hired by state and federal agencies aren’t sitting around bored, said Sam Harrel, an Alaska Division of Forestry spokesperson. The state is using federal infrastructure funding to remove fuels to prevent future fires, he said.
Alaska has also sent about 100 firefighters to help with blazes engulfing neighboring Canada.
A drawback to the conditions is that some Alaskans are missing out on what is usually a brief period of summery weather.
Eberhard Brunner of Anchorage wore a raincoat as he photographed geese at the city’s Westchester Lagoon on Thursday.
“It ... should be sunny, in the 70s,” said Brunner, 85. “If the weather keeps me home, I’ll never be able to get out.”
World & Nation
More than a dozen blazes sparked by lightning char spruce and tundra in the state’s interior. Hot weather is hindering fire crews.
Naomi Reupena-Tuaiao, a Honolulu native working in Anchorage while her Nebraska college is on summer break, also wishes it were warmer.
“It’s just cold,” she said from under a large umbrella, after standing outside in the rain for about seven hours, directing tourists to a trolley. Her shoes were wet and she was wearing two jackets.
The temperature in Anchorage has gone above 70 degrees only once this year.
Though conditions favor a mild fire season, Brettschneider said they could quickly change.
It’s still about 10 days until the historical peak for the state’s lightning season — last year, 61,000 lightning strikes were recorded July 5-11 — and it takes only a few days of sunny, breezy, dry weather to provide fuel for wildfires.
“Things can change on a dime,” he said.
Alaska’s fire season generally concludes at the end of August.

One last opinion,https://www.latimes.com/opinion/story/2023-06-30/final-column-nick-goldberg,2023-06-30,"This will be my last column.
I’ve been writing on the op-ed page of The Los Angeles Times twice a week since April of 2020, which means more than 150 weeks and more than 300 columns on everything from Donald Trump and Joe Biden to the uses and abuses of American history, the immorality of out-of-control income inequality, the history of telephone hold music, the new scourge of mosquitoes in Southern California and how the U.S. Constitution got broken. Before that, I was the editorial page editor of The Times for 11 years.
That’s a lot of opinions.
Opinion Columnist
Nicholas Goldberg
Nicholas Goldberg served 11 years as editor of the editorial page and is a former editor of the Op-Ed page and Sunday Opinion section.
It hasn’t been an easy time to be writing about the world. Considered opinion is out of vogue. Readers are angry and polarized. Democracy is in jeopardy, extremism is on the rise and a new Cold War is sneaking up on us. Armies are fighting again in Europe and climate change is bearing down. No one has much patience for nuance or for listening to those with whom they disagree. A belligerent certitude rules the day in the United States, especially on the right but also, too often, among progressives.
In the world of journalism, we live in an era of clicks and financial distress. And in the realm of public opinion, those who yell the loudest are rewarded, as you can see every night on the cable news networks. Civility, compromise, tolerance and other fusty concepts from smoother-running days are mocked as forms of surrender.
Democrats and Republicans increasingly see each other as close-minded, dishonest and less intelligent than other Americans,according to a Pew Research Center report last year. Worse, 72% of Republicans see Democrats as “a lot or somewhat more immoral” than other Americans, up from 47% in 2016. Sixty-three percent of Democrats say the same about Republicans, up from 35%.
Justice Sandra Day O’Connor’s 2003 prediction that affirmative action college admissions would only last 25 more years may come true if the current court has its way. That would be tragic.
About a year after I began writing the column, New York Times columnistFrank Bruni wrote his finalregular op-ed essay. He said he regretted being snide too often, and taking easy shots at political adversaries. He feared that columnists contributed to the “toxic tenor of American discourse.” And that we too often ignored “ambivalence and ambiguity.”
I took that to heart and tried not to do the same. Not that I didn’t spew my share of outrage — about the Jan. 6, 2021, assault on the U.S. Capitol, for instance, and about climate change, political hypocrisy and what I see as the wrong-headed and dangerous policies of ultraconservatives in Washington. But I also tried to speak up on behalf of the kind of reasonable cooperation and rational engagement that might help put American democracy back into working order.
That didn’t win everybody over.I still received regular hate mail. “Hope you get Chinese virus and suffer for lying to people … really do,” wrote one reader. (Admittedly, I had just called Trump “vindictive” and “irresponsible” and “averse to complex thinking.”) And this one: “Keep your mouth shut, kike.” And “libturd,” “pathetic,” “FOS.”
But I also got enough thoughtful responses, including from people who disagreed with my positions, to know there are still Americans who value serious discussion of complicated social issues. My faith in people was battered but not broken.
The centrist political group No Labels is threatening to put up a ‘unity’ candidate for president. But that’ll probably just reelect Trump.
Looking back at my own mistakes, I sometimes didn’t take astrongenough stand, failing to come down firmly on one side or the other. Sometimes nuance, ambiguity and calls for civil discourse are necessary; other times they’re merely cop-outs.
The columns I most enjoyed writing were the ones in which I sought to address off-the-beaten-path subjects that didn’t lend themselves to easy answers, where I tried to listen with an open mind to different points of view before drawing my own conclusions.
Should Boston let aChristian flag fly from its City Hall? Should the Supreme Court bebarred from declaring laws unconstitutional? After 22 years in prison, had aSouth African anti-apartheid fighterwho took early release in return for forswearing violence done the right thing?
One subject about which I could not be open-minded was Donald Trump and those who empowered and embraced him. Trump, Trumpism and the threat they pose to the United States are the defining issues of our era.
Ugly new accusations and graphic details continue the United States’ deep slide into embarrassing tabloid territory.
When Trump first came into office, I wrote in aneditorial series, “Our Dishonest President,”that what was worrisome about the new president was not so much his positions, policies or ideology — but Trump himself.
“He is a man so unpredictable, so reckless, so petulant, so full of blind self-regard, so untethered to reality that it is impossible to know where his presidency will lead or how much damage he will do to our nation,” I wrote.
Trump’s New York indictment for allegedly falsifying business records, his arraignment this month in the federal classified documents case, his two impeachments — and now his terrifying efforts to regain power — confirm that assessment. His incessant lies and his furious efforts to subvert the 2020 election show he is aberrant and uniquely dangerous.
Perhaps my greatest regret about the column is that I didn’t write enough about climate change, which experts believe will lead not only to more of the raging storms, droughts, deadly wildfires and heat waves we’re already getting used to, but also very possibly to famine, mass migration, collapsing economies and war. It is the greatest threat facing the planet, yet I, like others, have written about it only sporadically, and often as if it were just one of many nettlesome issues like taxes, crime or schools. Perhaps I should have written about nothing else.
The candidates running to succeed California’s senior senator stand to lose or gain if she resigns or sticks it out to finish her term.
And a final word about the state of journalism: Many newspapers are shrinking and flailing, local news faces an existential crisis, investigative reporting has been cut back, opinion journalism has too often been reduced to name calling — and objective, fair, credible coverage of events is under attack from the right and left.
These are dangerous developments because it is journalists who provide much of the information and context that enable citizens to participate knowledgeably and effectively in a democracy. Let’s stand up and support great reporting where it is still being done.
This column has run its course. It’s been an honor to write it. I will miss it. As I move on, I continue to wonder what, when or if something will put us back on track as a country. I am not certain we can continue for too much longer down this path of dysfunction and discord.

What wet winter? California prepares for peak wildfire season,https://www.latimes.com/environment/story/2023-06-29/california-prepares-for-peak-wildfire-season,2023-06-29,"As California faces itsfirst major heat wave of the summerthis Fourth of July weekend, state officials are urging residents to not become complacent about the threat of wildfires this year.
Standing beneath the blistering sun at the Grass Valley Air Attack Base in Nevada County, California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection chief Joe Tyler outlined the state’s plans to battle blazes this year with new tools and technology, as well as increased vegetation management efforts.
He cautioned that while the wet start to 2023 may have delayed the start of fire season, it has not deterred it.
“The abundant rain has produced tall grass and other vegetation that’s dried out already and is ready to burn,” Tyler said. Additionally, portions of the state are expected to soar into the triple digits this weekend, including up to 110 degrees in the Sacramento Valley.
California
‘Any spark from fireworks could easily start a fire in the tall grass crop that has cured and turned brown in recent weeks,’ the weather service says.
Tyler likened this year’s conditions to 2017, which started similarly wet but later saw dry vegetation and strong wind events that spurredmajor fires. More than 1.5 million acres burned that year, he said, killing 47 people and destroying 11,000 structures.
This year, there have already been a number of small wildfires, including afire in Riverside Countyon Tuesday that grew to 55 acres and burned at least two structures.
The week prior, Cal Fire responded to more than 300 blazes statewide, Tyler said. The agency is currently fully staffed with fire engines, bulldozers and aircraft ready to respond at the first sign of sparks.
“As the Fourth of July is quickly approaching us, I’m asking each of you to be mindful of how quickly a fire can have devastating consequences,” Tyler said.
He was joined by Gov. Gavin Newsom, who acknowledged that vegetation management plays a key role in reducing the state’s wildfires, which are getting hotter, faster and more frequent. But Newsom also said climate change — including worsening whiplash between extreme weather conditions — has accelerated the need for advanced firefighting response.
“In the last four years, we had two of the most extreme wildfires seasons — some of the most destructive in terms of acreage and property and lives lost — and then two of the more modest fire seasons,” Newsom said. “And so we live in this new reality where we can’t necessarily attach ourselves to some of the more predictive models of the past because of the nature of a world that’s getting a lot hotter, a lot drier, and a lot more uncertain as it relates to the issue of climate change.”
California
Between 1996 and 2020, wildfire burn areas in California grew five times larger than in the 25 years prior. Scientists say climate change is to blame.
Indeed, recent research found that California wildfires consumedfive times more areabetween 1996 and 2021 than in the 25 years prior, an increase chiefly attributed to climate change. Thirteen of the state’s 20 largest fires on record have burned in the last decade,according to Cal Fire.
Newsom and other officials outlined a war-like strategy for responding to the worsening threat.
Among the state’s latest tools is the Fire Integrated Real Time Intelligence System, or FIRIS, which includes advanced aircraft than can deliver real-time updates on fire behavior to crews on the ground.
For the second year in a row, the state will also deploy “Fire Hawks,” or modified Black Hawk helicopters thatcan fight fires at night. At least three Fire Hawks will be staffed 24 hours a day.
“It has been a game-changer,” said Benjamin Berman, chief pilot of Cal Fire’s helicopter program. The Fire Hawks “can seamlessly transition from fire suppression to hoist-air rescue to vegetation management without any further configuration.”
What’s more, the state’s firefighting portfolio now has about 1,000 mountaintop cameras that can provide real-time, 360-degree monitoring of the state’s forestlands;  pinpoint firestarts using artificial intelligence; and help organize resources for early suppression, Newsom said. Just a few years ago, such monitoring had to be conducted by people in towers.
The state is also working with the Biden administration, the Environmental Defense Fund and Lockheed Martin to streamline its use of existing defense technologies and satellites to provide constant monitoring and data collection. Similar tools have allowed the state to create 3-D model maps of 30 million acres of California.
“I don’t think that point is made enough of how we are modernizing our approach and how we’re meeting, dare I say, the moment,” Newsom said, “addressing the nature of the change, and the extremes that we’re now challenged with in this state.”
Many of the state’s most advanced firefighting efforts have been funded through federal and state investments, including$2.7 billion from the Legislature, he said.
Business
California’s biggest seller of homeowners insurance says regulations and wildfires make new policies a financial loser. But there are reasons to question that explanation.
But while significant preparations are underway, the reality of California’s worsening fires is already playing out for many Californians.
Earlier this year, insurance giants State Farm and Allstate both announced that they wouldstop writing new policies in the state, citing worsening wildfires and other catastrophes.
Newsom said he is working with the insurance commissioner to address the market in the state, and hoped that newliability insurance grantswould help accelerate vegetation management projects to reduce the risk of fire.
The grants will provide protections for practitioners of controlled burns, or intentional fires used to eliminate dry vegetation and other fuels. (California has set a goal of 400,000 acres of controlled burns per year by 2025).
However, the governor noted that only about 3% of wild lands in California are owned by the state, with the majority belonging to private owners and the federal government. He and other officials asked that residents do their part by creating a minimum of 100 feet of defensible space clearance around their homes and structures to help prevent a blaze from catching.
“Yes, we have the best mutual aid system in the world, but it’s also about mutual responsibility, and the state cannot do all of that alone,” he said.

"Los Angeles DWP loosens watering rules to three days a week, citing wet winter",https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2023-07-31/los-angeles-dwp-loosens-watering-rules-to-three-days-a-week,2023-07-31,"More than a year after instituting thestrictest water conservation ordersLos Angeles has ever seen, the L.A. Department of Water and Power announced Monday that it was loosening watering rules for its 4 million customers.
Effective immediately, all Angelenos can return to three-day-a-week watering schedules afterbeing placed on two-day-a-week limits in June 2022,the agency said.
Officials attributed the change to this year’s wet winter, whichboosted supplies and replenished reservoirsthat had been drained by three years of severe drought.
“We want to thank our customers for continuing to lead on conservation and helping us exceed our water conservation goals,” Anselmo Collins, DWP’s senior assistant general manager of the water system, said in a statement. “Over the past year, Angelenos reduced their water use an additional 10%, which is a remarkable achievement considering this was on top of the substantial long-term water conservation our customers had already achieved.”
Climate & Environment
As California drought worsens, the DWP in Los Angeles will limit outdoor watering to two days a week, with watering capped at eight minutes per station.
Prior to the change last June, Angelenos had been under a three-day-a-week ordinance since 2009. The city’s return to theless restrictive phase of its Emergency Water Conservation Ordinancemeans customers with street addresses ending in odd numbers can water on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays, and customers with even-numbered addresses can water on Tuesdays, Thursdays and Sundays.
Watering must be done before 9 a.m. or after 4 p.m. “when the evaporation rate is appreciably lower than during the middle of the day,” the agency said. Hand watering is allowed every day during those hours if the hose is equipped with a self-closing water shut-off device.
Last year’s tightened rules were issued amid the driest three years ever recorded in California, which spurred a statewide drought emergency and a call from Gov. Gavin Newsom asking that urban residentsvoluntarily cut back by 15%.
The Metropolitan Water District of Southern California — the massive wholesaler that supplies the DWP and dozens of other agencies in the area — declared its own water shortage emergency last year and placed 6 million people under unprecedented restrictions, including one-day-a-week watering limits in many areas. The MWDrolled back that order in March.
Despite its change, the DWP said water conservation continues to be a priority. Outdoor watering is still limited to eight minutes per station on permitted watering days, or 15 minutes twice a day with sprinklers that use water-conserving nozzles.
Watering continues to be prohibited within 48 hours of a measurable rain event, and hosing down driveways and sidewalks is not permitted. No water should leak from a pipe or fixture and no water should flow off of properties, the DWP said.
“We encourage all Angelenos to keep saving water wherever possible, while we continue to invest in developing our local water supplies to adapt to our changing climate,” Collins said.
California
Diamond Valley Lake — a backbone of the region’s water storage system — should refill to its full capacity by the end of this year, officials said.
Gregory Pierce, director of the Water Resources Group at UCLA, said reverting from two days back to three is “reasonable as a short-term measure.” But he warned that as global conditions continue to get hotter and drier, residents probably shouldn’t get used to the more flexible schedule.
“I would prefer if the language were more like, two days is what you should expect — it’s going to be more common in the future — but we can allow three in the short-term because of this unusual water year,” Pierce said. “I’d prefer the framing of two days as default, three as exceptional.”
Indeed, forecasters say2023 may be one of the hottest years ever recorded— if not the hottest — and that 2024 will be even hotter because of global warming and the arrival of El Niño.
What’s more, the Colorado River — a water lifeline for California and the West — haslost about 32.5 million acre-feet of water since 2000because of climate change and remains perilously low.  This year, California, Arizona and Nevada agreed tosignificantly reduce their useof that water in the coming years.
The DWP said it will continue to patrol the streets of Los Angeles to enforce its watering restrictions. The agency also offers incentive programs for turf replacement and water monitoring devices to help residents reduce their use, officials said.
But while Californians made a significant effort to conserve during the most recent drought, they ultimately fell short of Newsom’s 15% goal. Between July 2021 and March of this year — when the governor rescinded his request —statewide savings were about 7%, or about 9 fewer gallons per person per day, a Times analysis found.

"The Mojave Desert is burning in California’s biggest fire of year, torching Joshua trees",https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2023-07-31/york-fire-in-mojave-desert-grows-to-77000-acres,2023-07-31,"California’s biggest wildfire of the year — burning throughdelicate Joshua tree forestsalong the California-Nevada border — is an unusual desert blaze being fueled in part by the rapid growth of underbrush from this winter’s record rains.
The York fire had scorched 77,000 acres as of Monday, with no containment. Afterfirst being observed Friday, the blaze has spread mainly across the Mojave National Preserve in eastern San Bernardino County, but recently jumped into southwestern Nevada. No evacuations have been issued as a result of the fire, which is burning in mostly remote areas.
“It’s a public misconception that the desert doesn’t burn, but we’re seeing right here that that’s not case,” said Sierra Willoughby, a supervisory park ranger at Mojave National Preserve. “They’re not as rare as we would hope them to be.”
Just 10 days before this wildfire was spotted in the New York Mountains area of the Mojave National Preserve, park officials warned ofextreme fire riskfor the federally protected desert, banning all open flames.
“Even though we had a good moisture year with the [winter] season, thevery high temperaturesthat came in July were a concern for our fire folks,” Willoughby said.
California
Firefighters struggled to slow the York fire as it rampaged across a Mojave Desert landscape that is a vast, delicate and vital ecosystem.
Southern California’s wet winterand cool spring helped foster increasing levels ofinvasive grassesand underbrush in the Mojave and Colorado deserts, federal officials said, which has made the region exceptionally susceptible to brush fires this summer as those plants dry out.
This year’s climate patterns have provided a “more continuous fuel bed” than is typical for desert ecosystems, UCLA climatologist Daniel Swain saidon Twitter.
It all comes down to antecedent climate conditions. Given an exceptionally wet winter and cool spring, larger fires in sparsely vegetated areas that are typically ""fuel limited"" should be expected due to the extra vegetation growth such conditions foster. (2/3)
“Big fires in the desert are entirely consistent with the fire season outlook for 2023,” Swain wrote, noting that poses a major concern for ecologists and desert conservationists.
Fire regimes tend to vary on a gradient from climate-limited, in which there is an abundance of fuel but conditions are often too wet to carry fire, to fuel-limited, in which the climate is generally conducive to fire but there is usually not enough vegetation to carry it.
For this reason, forecasters had called for a less active fire season in California’s higher-elevation forests, which are dense but remain moist from the wet winter. But at lower elevations, the rains helped more grasses grow, and then several weeks of high temperatures caused the vegetation to dry out — or cure — priming it to become wildfire fuel.
Already, aJune 10 wildfireburned more than 1,000 acres in the Pleasant Valley area of Joshua Tree National Park. Invasive grasses played a role in stoking that fire, known as the Geology fire, which burned in an area populated by Joshua trees, Mojave yucca, creosote and senna, park officials said.
“Most of the deserts in the southwestern U.S. are fairly fuel-limited in dry years, so there was that kind of natural fire break between plants or keeping it confined to relatively small areas,” said Christopher McDonald, a natural resources advisor at UC Cooperative Extension.
But after a year of above-average rainfall, there’s more fuel connecting perennial shrubs and Joshua trees, which enables fire to spread among the plants, he said. Hot, windy conditions further primed vegetation to burn.
Climate & Environment
Firefighters in California have already responded to more than 640 wildland fires this year alone, including 135 in the last week.
Joshua treesand other desert plants have limited natural defenses to fires, officials said, and would struggle to recover from such blazes.
For the record:
3:01 p.m. Aug. 1, 2023A previous version of this story said endangered tortoises that live in the area of the fire could be harmed. The Mojave desert tortoise is listed as threatened under the Endangered Species Act.
The extent of the plants and animals at risk in the York fire are still under investigation, Willoughby said, noting that the blaze has already burned through Joshua tree, juniper and pinyon pine groves. Mojave desert tortoises,listed as threatenedunder the Endangered Species Act, also could be harmed, said Stephanie Bishop, a National Park Service public information officer and a spokesperson for the York fire.
“What we’ve seen is fires go through these areas and take out quite a bit,” Willoughby said. The York fire is burning in some of the areas that last saw flames in2005 from the Hackberry Complex fire,which eventually burned more than 70,000 acres. Willoughby said many of the forests harmed in that blaze 18 years ago still have not recovered.

The2020 Dome fire, which burned more than 40,000 acres across the southwestern California desert — including in the national preserve, but in a different area from the York fire — destroyed an estimated 1 millionJoshua trees. Crews and volunteers are trying toreplant and revitalize those groves.
In the Eastern Mojave, the heavy winter rains stoked the growth of native grasses, including big galleta, said ecologist Laura Cunningham, California’s director at the Western Watersheds Project and co-founder of conservation group Basin and Range Watch. The area doesn’t have as many invasive grasses, such as red brome and cheatgrass, which are more common in low-creosote deserts, but it does have a big Sahara mustard problem, which could be adding to the fuel, she said.
Some models suggest thatincreased global temperatures as a result of climate changeare bringing more rain to the Mojave desert, fueling grass growth and the risk of lightning strikes, Cunningham said. On top of that, more humans traveling into desert areas increases the risk of sparks — from a bullet glancing off a rock while someone is target shooting or a chain dragging on the pavement while someone is hauling a trailer, she said.
The New York Mountains in the Mojave National Preserve have an enormous density of rare plants, including blue blossom, manzanita and uncommon chaparral shrubs, that could be devastated by fire, she said.
“In those desert areas, the mountains are like sky islands, they call them,” she said — they rise from the “sea” of the hot desert floor that surrounds them and host dramatically different populations of plants and animals.
She thinks the vegetation and plants will recover from the fire, but probably very slowly — too slowly for one person to witness in their lifetime, she said.
“It’s kind of sad because it won’t be when we can see it,” she said. “We can watch it recover slowly, but those old-growth Joshua tree woodlands and shrublands, we won’t see those again in our lifetimes.”
California’s other big fire of the year —the Bonny fire, which has charred 2,300 acres in Riverside County — is also burning across some arid landscapes as well as through the mountains. It has forced 122 people to evacuate their homes, with almost 800 structures threatened, accordingto officialswith the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection.
The Bonny fire, burning south of Anza, was 20% contained as of Monday morning. One structure has been destroyed, and at least one firefighter was injured in the effort to control the flames. Almost 2,000 personnel are working that blaze, which began Thursday. Its cause is under investigation.
Climate & Environment
Gov. Gavin Newsom and California fire officials outline plans for ‘peak’ fire season.
Winds remain a major concern for both fires, officials have said.
A challenging weekend of high winds up to 30 mph sparked dangerous fire whirls that pushed the York fire across the Mojave National Preserve, said Bishop, a spokesperson for the York fire and a National Park Service public information officer. The weather overnight into Monday had improved slightly, with winds that were not as strong and some precipitation, which allowed for some groundwork and minimal fire growth, she said.
A monsoonal influence in the area could produce more of that helpful precipitation, but that pattern typically comes with heavy winds, officials said, and the test of thehot desert heatremains.
California
Firefighters and meteorologists look to a little-known metric called “mixing height” to understand how explosive wildfires spread in California without wind.
“The biggest challenge today that they’re going to be dealing with is limited visibility due to thick smoke,” Bishop said, noting that visibility has dropped to one mile in some areas.
Federal, state and local firefighting teams are battling the York fire, with more than 260 personnel assigned, officials said. The fire has also moved into the Avi Kwa Ame National Monument, which is Bureau of Land Management land, Willoughby said.
What ignited the fire remains under investigation, but Bishop said it was determined to have started on private land within the preserve.
Cunningham expressed concern for area residents — as people live in Fourth of July Canyon, right next to Caruthers Canyon, where there are inholdings within the preserve. The fire is also spreading toward Nipton and Searchlight, she said.
“Today is going to be a windy monsoonal stormy day, so we’ll see,” she said. “This ain’t over till it’s over.”
Big fires in the Mojave Desert are “unfortunately becoming a greater concern,” McDonald said.
“Historically, in general, deserts tended to burn fairly infrequently,” he said. “And that’s one of the reasons why you have a lot of these long-lived plants that can grow into big giant Joshua trees, or saguaros in the Sonoran Desert. But as more and more invasive plants, especially invasive grasses, have grown in desert areas, they’re able to carry fire and burn those long-lived plants and cause a change in the fire regime.”
An increase in fire can also lead to a shifting of habitats into something new, Cunningham said.
“If there are too many fires that happen in the same place over and over again, that can eliminate Joshua trees and other plants and turn it into some other type of vegetation,” she said. “So that’s definitely a concern. And again, if temperatures get hotter, that can cause vegetation to sort of migrate upward in elevation or more northerly.
“We know climate change is impacting the earth, so we have to really protect these special places now — really try to maintain them in a resilient way,” she added. “If there’s going to be a fire, we have to help them recover. They will restore themselves, but we can maybe speed up the process by preventing other fires in those same locations, maybe actively planting some seeds out there to help the plants regrow.”

"Wildfire burns at California-Nevada border, spawning fire tornadoes, torching desert landscape",https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2023-07-30/york-fire-california-nevada,2023-07-31,"The 70,000-acre wildfire that started in California’s Mojave National Preserve before sweeping across the border into Nevada remained 0% contained Sunday night as firefighters faced dangerous “fire whirls” — a product of intense heat and turbulent winds, officials said.
Firefighters struggled Sunday to slowthe blaze, which was rampaging across a Mojave Desert landscape that is a vast, delicate and vital ecosystem rich in wildlife — tortoises, foxes, badgers, bobcats, bighorn sheep — and Joshua trees, and the animals and plants are vulnerable to wildfires.
Earlier this year, heavy rains triggered explosive growth of grasses throughout Southern California’s desert regions. Feeding off nitrogen-laden smog wafting in from the Los Angeles area, the grasses left Joshua tree forests vulnerable to large-scale brush fires.
“Miles upon miles of invasive grasses are like flash paper in the understory of the Mojave Desert,” Frazier Haney, executive director of the Wildlands Conservancy, told The Times on Sunday.
“A wildfire like this one can, in a matter of minutes, wipe out a remarkable diversity of species created by nature over tens of thousands of years,” Haney said.
In 2020,the Dome fire killedas many as 1.3 million plants across more than 40,000 acres of California desert, including a large portion of Mojave National Preserve.
For the York fire, gusting, erratic winds have complicated the firefight.
The wildfire was creating spinning vortexes of flame and smoke, known asfire whirls or fire tornadoes, federal officials said: “They have the potential to spread embers over long distances and can start new fires ahead of the main fire front. Additional fire whirls can change direction suddenly, making them unpredictable and difficult to anticipate.”
Showers and thunderstorms in the area of the fire were also causing “sudden, erratic winds,” according to Ashley Nickerson, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service in Las Vegas. “That makes it really hard to contain a fire.”
Nickerson said the difficult conditions were not expected to let up over the next couple of days as the winds continued with gusts of 20 to 30 mph and moisture increased, bringing the possibility of more thunderstorms.
Despite the size of the fire and lack of containment, officials said there were no plans as of about 7 p.m. Sunday to issue evacuation orders for residential areas, including Nipton and Searchlight. “The fire ... remains some distance from these areas,” Clark County officials tweeted, “and [Clark County Fire Department] continues to coordinate response and resources with partner agencies.”
The blaze started in federal lands in Mojave National Preserve and was first observed Friday burning near Caruthers Canyon, said Stephanie Bishop, a National Park Service public information officer and spokesperson for the York fire. The cause of the blaze has not yet been determined, Bishop said.
An update From#ClarkCountyand the@ClarkCountyFDregarding the York Fire burning in the@MojaveNPSand has now moved into Nevada.See statement attached.pic.twitter.com/Wer45GJejo
Clark County advised the public to avoid State Route 164.
The National Park Service, Bureau of Land Management, San Bernardino County Fire Protection District and Clark County Fire Department were providing resources to support suppression efforts, which included air and ground crews. Officials said there were more than 200 personnel fighting the blaze.
In Riverside County,the Bonny firewas at 2,206 acres and 10% containment as of Sunday night. Multiple homes were threatened by the fire, which ignited Thursday afternoon near the community of Aguanga, southeast of Temecula.
Evacuation orders were in effect for north of the San Diego County border; east of Bonny Lane; south of Bowers, Bailey and Ramsey roads; and west of Anza Borrego State Park.

"Measure J, L.A. County’s 2020 criminal justice reform measure, is constitutional, appellate court finds",https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2023-07-30/measure-j-l-a-countys-2020-criminal-justice-reform-measure-is-back-from-the-dead,2023-07-30,"An appellate court has ruled that a sweeping Los Angeles County criminal justice reform initiative known as Measure J is constitutional, potentially paving the way for millions of dollars to be invested in social services and a host of community-based jail diversion programs.
A three-judge panel of the state’s 2nd District Court of Appeal on Friday reversed an L.A. County Superior Court judge’s ruling in 2021 that struck down the voter-approved initiative.
Measure J requires that 10% of locally generated, unrestricted L.A. County money — estimated between $360 million and $900 million — be spent on social services, including housing, mental health treatment and other jail diversion programs. The county is prohibited from spending the money on the carceral system — prisons, jails or law enforcement agencies.
Measure Jwas a landmark momentin L.A. County politics when the powerful Board of Supervisors acted on what community activists had been pleading with the board to do for years: reallocate how county money is spent to disrupt the county’s reliance on its jails to house those with serious mental illnesses and people who committed low-level crimes in response to poverty or addiction.
The supervisors voted in July 2020 to place Measure J on the ballot when those pleas were amplified, and made politically safer to address, after a national outcry over the murder of George Floyd in Minnesota and similar killings of unarmed Black people by law enforcement.
About 2.2 million L.A. County voters, representing 57% of the ballots cast,approved the November 2020 ballot measure.However, the following December, a coalition of county unions (and two private residents) demanded in court that Measure J be stopped, arguing “the voters lacked constitutional and statutory authority to require the Board and County officers to take specific budget actions,” according to court records.
California
A Superior Court judge declares that Measure J, which Los Angeles County voters approved last year to set aside public funds for social services, is unconstitutional.
The opposition group was essentially led by the Assn. for Los Angeles Deputy Sheriffs, a union representing sheriff‘s deputies, which had spent more than $3.5 million on advertising on TV and social media to fight Measure J.
In June 2021, L.A. County Superior Court Judge Mary H. Strobelruled in favor of the unions,holding that Measure J was unconstitutional because it improperly restricted how the L.A. County Board of Supervisors could spend county money.
“The only question presented is whether the ballot process can be used to take this budgeting choice out of the hands of the current and future elected boards,” Strobel wrote in her proposed ruling in June 2021. “The court concludes it cannot.”
But, on Friday, the 2nd District Court of Appeal reversed Strobel’s decision, holding that the California Constitution allows counties to implement such budgeting strategies into their charters. (Not all California counties have charters, but L.A. County is one, meaning it has some self-governing power allowed through its charter.)
Measure J “neither impairs the exercise of essential government functions nor violates state law,” the appellate court held. “Measure J thus is enforceable.”
Friday’s news brought much celebration from community activists who spent hundreds of hours lobbying the Board of Supervisors for change.
California
The measure would require that 10% of county funds be spent on social services such as housing and jail diversion programs. The county would be prohibited from using the money on prisons, jails or law enforcement agencies.
L.A. City Councilmember Eunisses Hernandez, who co-chaired the Re-Imagine L.A. County campaign, was cheering and overwhelmed with joy when called for comment.
“This is a win that a lot of us have been waiting for, and it’s so powerful because it reaffirms this vision,” Hernandez said. “Communities want  ... our dollars to go to care, and I think when we talk about public safety, Measure J was our response to what we think public safety is and what it should look like.”
Derek Hsieh, executive director of the Assn. for Los Angeles Deputy Sheriffs, said his organization is disappointed with Friday’s court decision, and its attorneys will analyze the ruling to determine the organization’s next steps in fighting Measure J.
Board of Supervisors Chair Janice Hahn said in a statement that “the voters of L.A. County made it clear they want us to spend more money keeping people out of jail, and this appeals court has upheld their wishes.”
It remains unclear how Measure J will affect the county’s budget, including the Sheriff’s Department. After Measure J was struck down, the Board of Supervisors committed to budgeting exactly as Measure J called for. The supervisors created the Care First Community Investment fund and have allocated about $400 million to it over the last few years.
Measure J opponents previously argued these types of funding cuts would harm public safety and cause crime rates to rise.
Hsieh said it’s hard to discern whether those funding changes have affected the L.A. County Sheriff’s Department in part because the agency remains deeply understaffed with deputies working hundreds of hours in overtime. The supervisors have failed to  train and hire new deputies, he said.
“With the increasing criminal issues within L.A. County and the coming of the Olympics and other significant events, I don’t think the supervisors are going to have a choice but grow the department’s academies,” Hsieh said.
Megan Castillo, who serves on the fund’s advisory committee, said the county must commit more.
Since the beginnings of Measure J, the county chief executive officer and community activists have been at odds over how much money should be allocated for Measure J. The county CEO originally estimated that $360 million would be allocated for Measure J, while activists argued that number was closer to $900 million.
Castillo, Re-Imagine LA Coalition coordinator, said if the supervisors want to follow the full spirit of Measure J, they will allocate more to address the county’s under- and disinvestment in BIPOC communities that’s led to over-policing and generational trauma.
“This is a major victory for the people,” said Castillo, policy and advocacy manager at nonprofit La Defensa. “The law enforcement special interest groups tried to use the judicial system to circumvent change for L.A. County residents because they fear the power of the people, and I think this (ruling) is a testament that says Measure J is truly here to stay.”

No fly zone: Swath of Santa Clarita Valley under quarantine due to invasive tau fruit fly,https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2023-07-28/swath-of-santa-clarita-valley-under-quarantine-due-to-invasive-tau-fruit-fly,2023-07-29,"A swath of the Santa Clarita Valley is under a first-of-its-kind quarantine after the invasive and pestilent tau fruit fly was found in the area, officials announced this week.
The quarantine went into effect July 11, after more than 20 flies were found in the area of Stevenson Ranch, the California Department of Food and Agriculture said ina release. The flies were probably introduced to the area by travelers who brought uninspected produce from out of state.
The action marks the first-ever tau fruit fly quarantine in the Western Hemisphere, state officials said.
Unlike quarantines implemented in response to COVID-19, however, this one is not for people but for fruits and vegetables.
California
Plants like Sahara or black mustard, common in Southern California but not native to it, can strangle native flowers and pose fire danger.
Native to Asia, the yellow-and-black tau fruit fly is a serious pest for plants — with a wide host range that includes numerous fruits and vegetables, as well as some native California plants, the department said.
Residents in the 79-square-mile quarantine zone are advised to not “move any fruits and vegetables from their property,” according to the department’s statement.
Produce can be consumed, cooked or juiced  onsite.
“Otherwise, they should be disposed of by double-bagging in plastic” and placed “in a bin specifically for garbage,” the department said.
Officials said the circular quarantine zone is roughly bordered to the north by Castaic Junction, the south by Oat Mountain, west by Del Valle Road and east by Honby Avenue. A detailed map can beviewed here.
The Food and Agriculture Department will work with the U.S. Department of Agriculture and Los Angeles County agricultural commissioner to eliminate the fly and prevent its spread.
On properties within a 200-meter radius of where flies have been detected, “staff will cut host fruit and vegetables to inspect for any fruit fly larvae that may be present,” according to the California Department of Food and Agriculture.
Properties will also be treated with Spinosad, a “naturally derived organic-approved material” to remove adult flies, officials said. Responders will also use fly traps.

San Bernardino County pays $3 million to settle sexual harassment lawsuit against public defender’s office,https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2023-07-28/san-bernardino-county-pays-3-million-to-settle-sexual-harassment-lawsuit-against-public-defenders-office,2023-07-28,"San Bernardino County has agreed to pay $3 million to settle a lawsuit filed by four former employees of its public defender’s office who said they were sexually harassed and coerced into sexual acts, the plaintiff’s attorney announced Friday.
The lawsuit, filed in November 2021, alleged that female employees “were forced to perform oral sex” and that “top managers accessed porn sites during Public Defender training” and “used a county car to take other public defenders to a strip club.”
The plaintiff’s attorney Bradley Gage characterized the office as having an “Animal House” culture.
The lawsuit also alleged that former county Public Defender Gregory Christopher Gardner, who resigned in 2020, had pursued sexual relationships with multiple employees.
“The victims are not here [in court] today because what they went through was so traumatic,” Gage said at a news conference  Friday at his Woodland Hills office. “Some of them indicated to me how important it is that the community see the terrible toll that harassment can take on a victim.”
The county is paying $3 million of the settlement while Gardner is paying $40,000, Gage said.
The plaintiffs will receive between $500,000 to $1 million each.
The county issued a brief statement Friday about the settlement, saying it had “a strict, long-standing, zero-tolerance policy prohibiting harassment, retaliation, and workplace violence.”
“The County maintains that it addressed the matters in question promptly, appropriately, responsibly, and effectively when concerns were brought to the County’s attention,” according to the statement. “The County agreed to settle this case to protect the taxpayers from the high costs of protracted litigation, and to assist the Public Defender’s office in moving forward.”
But Gage noted that some victims were disappointed that the county appears to have never taken any disciplinary action against Gardner.
“The women feel that they have been punished while the harasser has gone about finding a new job, continuing to work as a lawyer, making a nice living, having accolades and a reputation that is pretty much unsullied,” Gage said.
California
Anna Laura Costa Porsborg came to Los Angeles last Christmas Eve for a weeklong vacation. Authorities do not believe she ever left. Her remains, they suspect, are somewhere in the Angeles National Forest.
None of the women, one of whom was an attorney, currently work at the public defender’s office.
According to the complaint, Gardner engaged in quid pro quo harassment of women in exchange for job benefits.
In one incident, Gardner   was accused of driving  a woman to Newport Beach for a meeting that was supposedly regarding work.
The woman asked to be taken home after realizing that “Gardner did not want to discuss work,” according to the complaint.
California
Last summer, a dangerous heat wave across California pushed the power grid almost to the brink. Officials say the state is better equipped to weather such extreme heat this year, but late summer could still be a test.
According to the complaint, Gardner allegedly refused to let the woman leave the vehicle and “slammed [the woman’s arm] into the console of the vehicle causing injury and bleeding.”
The woman filed a report with the Newport Beach Police Department but Gardner has not faced prosecution, Gage said.
“You can never really have a consensual sexual relationship with the boss,” Gage said Friday. “Because whether it’s a male or a female, the boss gets to control the terms and conditions of your employment. There’s always a fear that if you turn them down, you’re now going to have problems with your job.”

"Riverside County fire breaks containment, surging to 2,206 acres near evacuated homes",https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2023-07-28/riverside-county-bonny-fire-evacuation-orders-aguanga-sunset-fire-banning,2023-07-29,"A Riverside County wildfire continued to burn out of control Saturday evening and had swelled to 2,206  acres,  while parts of a nearby residential community remained under evacuation orders.
The Bonny fire,which ignited Thursday afternoon near Aguanga southeast of Temecula, has grown steadily amid changing wind patterns, according to the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection/Riverside County Fire Department.
The fire has been burning  close to the community of Terwilliger Valley, but so far no homes have been damaged and one injury has been reported. A fire official said a “large part” of the blaze was burning in the wilderness and away from homes but that the situation could easily change for the worse.  Officials said flames have destroyed a nonresidential building and one vehicle.
The blaze was 5% contained as of Saturday morning. Crews had estimated its containment at 10% early Friday, but lost ground as the fire swelled in size.
More than 1,000 firefighters continued to battle the blaze under a heat advisory as it burned toward the southeast, charring dense vegetation. Air resources including five helicopters were also on hand.
“The firefighters were able to do some good work despite the steep, rugged terrain,” said Rob Roseen, a public information officer for the fire department.
Temperatures on Fridaycrept up into the triple digitswith low humidity. Similar weather conditions are expected Saturday, with a chance of thunderstorms in the afternoon, heightening the risk of erratic fire behavior, officials said.

There will be continued risk of lightning in the area from Sunday night into Monday morning, before temperatures fall back into the 90s, where they’re expected to remain for much of the week, said Casey Oswant, meteorologist with the National Weather Service San Diego office.
“It will be pretty toasty for the next couple of days,” Oswant said.
Evacuation orders expanded Friday afternoon, more than tripling the number of homes threatened by the fire. Awildfire smoke advisorywas issued for eastern Riverside County, with residents urged to stay indoors if they smell smoke or see ash.
At 12:30 p.m., all residents of the Terwilliger Valley community wereordered to evacuate, affecting more than 700 homes. The expanded evacuation included residents north of the San Diego County border, west of Anza-Borrego Desert State Park, south of Bowers, Bailey and Ramsey roads, and east of Bonny Lane.
Hamilton High School in Anza, at 57430 Mitchell Road, is serving as an evacuation center. A stretch of Old Mitchell Camp Road between Chihuahua Valley Road and Cooper Cienega Truck Trail was closed, as was Chihuahua Valley Road between Old Mitchell Camp Road and Highway 79.
Capt. Robert Foxworthy, a spokesperson for Cal Fire, said this winter’shistoric rainfall and snowpackdelayed the fire season. But in the coming weeks, he expects larger fires to ignite in recently dried fuels.
“As we continue in the summer, especially with 100-plus temperatures, we will continue to have fuels dying out and drying out and being more receptive to burn,” he said. “The chances for those bigger fires will only increase.”
California
The Quick Reaction Force from the Los Angeles, Ventura and Orange county fire departments will be available 24 hours a day all year long.
Another Riverside County fire that broke out Thursday evening, near Banning, was no longer active on Saturday.
The York Fire in northeast San Bernardino County had rapidly expanded Saturday to 30,000 acres, according to a spokesperson with the Mojave National Preserve. The only structures threatened were some cabins in the wilderness, the official said.
The Sunset fire, which ignited near Mesa and Gilman streets, had reached 103 acres and firefighters were battling the blaze through Friday.
Investigators said Friday they believe that fire was the result of arson. One suspect — identified only as Andre Cox — has been arrested and now faces multiple charges, fire officials said.

"California has new weapons to battle summer blackouts: Battery storage, power from record rain",https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2023-07-28/could-californias-power-grid-become-strained-this-summer,2023-07-28,"It’s a summertime sequence that’s become all too familiar in California: Extreme heat forces air conditioners into overdrive, which pushes the state’s power gridto the brink.
In August 2020, a major heat eventfueled by the climate crisisforced some of the state’sfirst rotating power outagesin decades, as the ongoing transition to green energy lagged behind demand. Last September, Californiansnarrowly avoided rolling blackoutsas a record-breaking heat wave broiled almost every corner of the state for days.
Now, California is trying to avoid a repeat this summer asglobal warming pushes temperatures higherand for longer stretches of time.
As anunrelenting heat waveacross the West nears the start of its second month, officials said therisks remain high. But they are hopeful they have new tools at their disposal, including substantial growth in battery storage, increased hydropower thanks to historic winter rains and storms, andbackup resources available through contingency plans.
California
State officials say the winter’s wild weather helped refill hydropower generators, decreasing the risk of dangerous electricity outages this summer.
“We’re feeling more confident in [California Independent Service Operator’s] ability to get through the summer, and more resources are getting added to the grid,” said Ric O’Connell, executive director ofGridLab, a nonprofit focused on power grid transformation. “In general, we’re doing better this summer because we have better hydro, we have more batteries.”
Since last summer, California ISO — the nonprofit that runs the state’s electric grid — has brought more than 2,000 megawatts of new battery storage online, an almost 75% increase in capacity, officials said. And that’s expected to continue.
“The batteries are important, because they charge during the middle of the day when we have surplus solar production and discharge that energy onto the grid in the evenings, when solar is ramping off the system and we’re trying to fill the gap in supply,” Anne Gonzales, a spokesperson for the California ISO, wrote in a statement.
California ISO just reached a record high of battery charging this week — almost doubling the peak from a year prior,according GridStatus,a website that tracks independent service operators. And compared to data from last summer’s heat wave, California ISO’s energy supplies this week have already relied more heavily on battery supply during peak hours,according to supply data.
California
California’s first heat wave of the year could last into next week. Here are some tips on how to stay safe and cool during hot weather.
One megawatt of electricity is enough to power about 750 homes. And while renewable resources have exponentially increased in recent years, it’s worth noting that natural gas still fuels well over 40% of the state’s power most days.
But even with additional resources available this summer, officials say nothing is for certain in our changing climate.
“This year, we predict no shortfalls under average conditions,” Siva Gunda, vice chair of the California Energy Commission, said ina May briefing. “Extremes of climate change remain a wild card — another extreme event like last summer could once again put the grid into vulnerable territory.”
He predicted that a situation like last September — when the grid hitrecord-high demand, at about 52,000 megawatts — could likely be managed with the state’s contingency resources and additional market procurements. But if faced with another challenge such as a major wildfire or provider outages, Gunda said, the grid could fall short.
California
Death Valley, one of the most extreme places on the planet, is already seeing the impact of climate change, with summers even hotter than usual.
Grid operators already have issued multipleenergy emergency alertsduring the last few days of the heat wave, albeit at the lowest priority. Rolling blackouts or Flex Alerts weren’t a real concern, officials said, though high demand and high temperatures forced the need to unlock additional energy supplies.
“We got some luck during the July heat waves, because while inland temperatures were hot and in some cases above normal, the direct coastal temperatures didn’t get extreme,” Gonzales said, noting that cloud cover and the cooler coasts have kept demand for energy well below prior records. “We haven’t hit particularly high demand yet.”
Even still, California ISO last week issued anenergy emergency alert 1, noting “higher than anticipated demand,” but ended it an hour later. Then this week, officials issued twoenergy emergency watches— the lowest warning — citing Wednesday “some resources going offline, continued excessive heat in interior Southern California and transmission congestion restricting movement of power to parts of the state.”
But data shows demand, even at peak hours, never quite flirted near capacity as it did repeatedly last September.
California
Officials credit the emergency alert sent Tuesday night for the avoidance of widespread blackouts during record-setting energy demands.
“So while we haven’t seen substantial stress on the grid this summer, we haven’t been fully tested,” Gonzales said. “August and September historically can be times of stress on the grid.”
In the later summer, heat often becomes more extreme and wildfire activity increases, the latter of which can take out major transmission lines or generation. That time of year also becomes drier and days are shorter, reducing hydro and solar power, officials have said.
“Even though we see an improved situation for this summer, folks shouldn’t be surprised to see a Flex Alert, necessarily,” Alice Reynolds, president of the California Public Utilities Commission, warned this spring. “We’re talking about extreme heat, unusual events that are hard to manage.”
And there are also looming concerns about regional power supplies that can affect California, said Carrie Bentley, an energy consultant for the California ISO and chief executive of Gridwell Consulting.
“I think it’s going to be a challenging summer,” Bentley said. “I think from the California perspective we are much better, but we’re connected with the rest of the West.”
California
California’s power grid is typically tested during wildfire season or intense heat waves, but a winter storm system has challenged the state’s electric grid in new ways. Experts say resiliency measures are needed.
Unlike in California, hydropower in the Pacific Northwest is down, and the region has also recently shuttered some power plants — all while more residents are using air conditioners, sweltering under the kind of heat not typically felt in the historically cooler region.
“We’re not seeing the imports that we typically see during the summer,” Bentley said. “Higher demand and lower supply in the Pacific Northwest — they just simply have less power to import into California.”
So the balancing act of transitioning to green energy while keeping the lights on continues.
“The tight situation we had back in 2020 is behind us, but it’s hard to say — the weather this summer has been weird and intense,” O’Connell said. “How do we get resources online faster? Because we don’t want to be caught short again.”

"In the wake of backlash, Oprah Winfrey starts a fund for Maui fire victims alongside Dwayne Johnson",https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/story/2023-08-31/maui-fires-oprah-winfrey-dwayne-johnson-fund-backlash,2023-08-31,"Oprah Winfrey and Dwayne Johnson are teaming up to provide financial aid to those who have been affected by thehistoric Maui firesthat ravaged the Hawaiian island earlier this month.
The pair announced their charitable foundation Thursday in a jointInstagramvideo.
“We have created the People’s Fund of Maui that will put money directly in the hands of the people who need it, right now,” Winfrey said. “So if you send a donation ... that money  is going to go to one of many residents who have been displaced in Maui — we guarantee it.”
Every adult Maui resident who was affected by the wildfires, which were thedeadliest of  the last century in the U.S., is eligible to receive $1,200 per month as they recover from the natural disaster. Those who qualify can apply for relief onthe fund’s website.
California
Wildfires on the Hawaiian island of Maui have killed at least 36 people, displaced thousands of residents and destroyed hundreds of structures, including homes, businesses and a school, prompting President Biden to declare a “major disaster.”
The  two stars were compelled to launch the fund in part because they were fielding questions from people close to them about which foundations would provide the most immediate help to those affected.
“I know a lot of people out there ... are just having a hard time trusting where the money goes,” Johnson said. “The fund that we created ... is a clean direct from you, directly to their hands, and right away with some real immediacy, because as we’re finding — that you guys around the world know — with disasters like this, the  No. 1 need is money.”
Winfrey and Johnson started their campaign with a $10-million donation to those who suffered from the wildfires in Lahaina and Kula.
Entertainment & Arts
Oprah Winfrey, who lives part-time in Maui, arrived at a shelter there with pillows, shampoo and other supplies in tow for residents displaced by wildfires.
“So people being able to have their own agency being able to make decisions for themselves about what they need, and when their family needs. That’s our goal is to get that to the people now,” Winfrey continued in the video. “And so we appreciate any support you can give. All the people who are calling me and texting me and messaging me and saying, ‘What do I do? What do I do?’ This is what you do!”
OnInstagramearlier this month, Winfrey, whoowns more than 1,000 acresof land in Maui, promised to “make a major donation” to help the island recover.
Commenters online werequick to criticize the former talk-show hostfor her response and the fact that she owns land on the island.
World & Nation
After Maui’s wildfire, with tourism down and Hawaii home prices already high, some are making mainland moves, with California and Las Vegas in their sights.
Johnson, who is of Polynesian descent, also posted onInstagramabout the natural disaster as it struck the island earlier this month.
“I’m completely heartbroken over this, and I know that all of you are too,” said Johnson, who tagged the nonprofit organizationHawaii Community Foundationin that post. “Everything that I’ve seen transpire over these past couple of days, everything that continues to transpire, hour-by-hour, minute-by-minute, it’s all heartbreaking.”

Five things to watch when UCLA faces Coastal Carolina in season opener,https://www.latimes.com/sports/ucla/story/2023-08-31/ucla-football-preview-2023-season-opener-coastal-carolina,2023-08-31,"The Three Amigos. A modern triumvirate. A three-headed monster.
Call it whatever you want, but what’s been described as a friendly competition is about to take a dramatic turn. Starting Saturday night, UCLA’s top three quarterbacks no longer will battle it out exclusively in the comfort of closed practices.
A Rose Bowl crowd and a national television audience will evaluate the trio that’s trying to evolve into a solo act.Ethan Garbers,Dante MooreandCollin Schleewill all play againstCoastal Carolinain theBruins’ season opener,. What will coachChip Kellybe looking for in his evaluation?
“Who’s gonna help us win the game,” Kelly said. “Very simple process, and I think all three of those guys can do that and that’s why all three of those guys will play.”

UCLA Sports
UCLA would love to win the Pac-12 in its final season in the conference, but it won’t be easy. Here’s what the Bruins much achieve to make it happen.

Here are five things to watch whenthe Bruinsface the Chanticleers:

Garbers will start based on having the most experience in Kelly’s system. Moore, a freshman, and Schlee, a transfer from Kent State, will come off the bench.
How will playing time be divided? Kelly said that decision would not be made until Saturday in the event that someone got hurt in practice.
The coach also would not divulge when — or if — he would abandon this approach in favor of playing one quarterback, barring injuries or blowout situations.

Garbers said he would focus on the basics needed to have a good showing.
“I need to get the ball to our receivers,” he said, “protect myself in the protection and make some good stuff in the run game and let the guys around me do the work.”

UCLAwill have its third defensive coordinator in as many seasons whenD’Anton Lynnmakes his Bruins debut Saturday.
His players have said this defense will swarm to the ball and force turnovers. It certainly has potential playmakers in edge rusherLaiatu Latu, a preseason All-American, in addition to twin edge rushersGraysonandGabriel Murphy.
What will probably determine whether the Bruins make a massive leap in performance is improvement from the linebackers and the secondary, which have been weaknesses in recent seasons. Last season, UCLA gave up an average of 273 passing yards per game, ranking No. 116 nationally.

Kamari Ramsey, who won a starting safety job as a redshirt freshman alongside redshirt seniorKenny Churchwell III, must quickly become a steadying force on the back end of this reformulated defense.

UCLA’s defense won’t get to ease its way into a new era.
Coastal Carolina quarterbackGrayson McCallholds school records after accounting for 95 touchdowns (78 passing) during his first four seasons, when he became the first player to be selected the Sun Belt Conference player of the year three consecutive times. The redshirt senior is both crafty and accurate, having completed 69.7% of his passes last season for 24 touchdowns with only two interceptions.
He’ll try to join the list of gritty quarterbacks to beat the Bruins at the Rose Bowl in recent seasons that includes Jayden de Laura, Caleb Williams, Jayden Daniels, Anthony Brown and Jake Haener.


UCLA’s run game has been a force under Kelly since Josh Kelley became the starter against Colorado in the fourth game of the 2018 season.
Last season, the Bruins’ average of 237.2 rushing yards per game ranked sixth in the Football Bowl Subdivision and allowed the team to lead the Pac-12 for the first time since 1976. That was the primary reason UCLA assembled its highest-scoring offense (39.2 points per game) since 1998 and set a program record with 503.6 total yards per game.
The depth chart released this week listed the dreaded “OR” designation withT.J. Harden,Carson SteeleandColson Yankoff, but Harden and Steele are widely expected to get the bulk of the carries.
Sports
Which teams will stand out during the 2023 college football season. J. Brady McCollough makes his picks and predictions for every Power 5 conference game.

UCLA will give four complimentary tickets — two for the season opener and two for the home game against North Carolina Central on Sept. 16 — to fans who donate at least $10 toward relief efforts for the recent Hawaii wildfires by Saturday.

Dodgers respond to Scott Boras’ remarks on Cody Bellinger; Boras clarifies his stance,https://www.latimes.com/sports/dodgers/story/2023-08-30/dodgers-andrew-friedman-scott-boras-cody-bellinger,2023-08-31,"Ten months later, the ripple effects of Cody Bellinger’s unceremonious split fromthe Dodgerscontinue to make waves.
This week, USA Today ran a story about Bellinger, the former National League most valuable player who is enjoying a resurgent season with the Chicago Cubs after he was not offered a contract by the Dodgers following two injury-plagued seasons.
The story included a quote from Bellinger’s representative,Scott Boras, in which the agent sounded as if he blamed the Dodgers for Bellinger’s career-worst seasons in 2021 and 2022.
“He was hurt, plain and simple,” Boras said, referencing the shoulder surgery Bellinger had after the 2020 season that was believed to have affected his performances in the following two seasons.
“He has surgery, and the Dodgers asked him to play with a 35% strength deficiency, and then with COVID, he was deprived of the expert medical treatment,” Boras added.
“He didn’t have the shoulder strength. You don’t just go from a .900 OPS to a .500 OPS without understanding the impact of an injury.
“So, when he became a free agent, Cody told me, ‘I want to go to teams that know me the best, and I want to go where people understand me.’ ”
Dodgers
The accuser in a civil suit against former Dodgers pitcher Trevor Bauer wants him turn over two other women’s statements to MLB investigators.
Boras’ comments were perceived by some around the sport — as well as within the Dodgers organization — as a shot at the team.
Before Wednesday’s game, the club’s president of baseball operations,Andrew Friedman, offered a blunt response.
“I don’t want to stoop down to that level,” Friedman told The Times. “But I find it to be a very convenient narrative. We weren’t surprised by it at all.”
When reached by phone Wednesday night and told of Friedman’s comments, Boras clarified the quotes he gave to USA Today.
He said there had been “no wrongdoing” by the Dodgers for having Bellinger play in 2021, when the outfielder batted .165 with 10 home runs and 94 strikeouts, and that his client was never pressed into playing when he wasn’t comfortable doing so.
“The Dodgers were not forcing Cody to play,” Boras said. “But Cody is a good teammate. And he wanted to play and go out there, knowing he just had surgery. That was the extent of that. And he had a clear strength deficit because of the surgery.
“There was no wrongdoing on the Dodgers’ part, because it was mutual that Cody wanted to play and the Dodgers wanted him to play.”
Friedman in his earlier response also noted that the agent’s original comments didn’t mention the Boras Sports Training Institute — the Southern California-based training center Boras has touted a boon to his clients, especially ones like Bellinger trying to work their way back from injuries.
“What I found really interesting was that there was no mention of the Boras Institute and its role in any of this,” Friedman said. “But I’ll just leave it at that.”
When relayed Boras’ clarification on Wednesday night, Friedman declined to comment further.
Once a Dodgers franchise favorite who won NL rookie of the year in 2017, the NL MVP in 2019 and a World Series title in 2020, Bellinger had a frustrating end to his time in L.A. following his November 2020 shoulder surgery — which was necessitated after Bellinger infamously got hurt in a celebration with teammate Kiké Hernández that postseason.
After his dismal 2021 campaign, Bellinger rebounded slightly last year, batting .210 with 19 home runs and 68 RBIs.
The Dodgers held out optimism the 28-year-old could keep improving this year.
“I know he’s working with our guys and doing everything he can to put himself in position to be a real force for us next year,” Friedman said during the general manager meetings in November.
However, with Bellinger entering his final season of arbitration, the Dodgers were faced with a tricky financial decision just weeks later: tender the outfielder a contract that probably would pay him more than $18 million, or save the money and allow him to become a free agent.
Dodgers
Juan Gomez cultivated a shrine to his beloved Dodgers inside Lahaina restaurant Penne Pasta. It was destroyed by the wildfire.
The team chose the latter, opening the door for the Cubs to sign Bellinger as a free agent on a one-year, $17.5-million deal.
“I wish we could have done more to support him and get some more consistency for him,” Dodgers manager Dave Roberts said ahead of Bellinger’s Dodger Stadium homecoming in April. “But sometimes you just don’t have any answers.”
Although the Dodgers seem unlikely to pursue Bellinger in free agency this winter — when he will be one of the biggest-name bats on the market, thanks to his .317 batting average, 20 home runs and .901 on-base-plus-slugging percentage — the team could be involved with other Boras clients. Most notably, Boras represents pitcher Julio Urías, another face of the Dodgers franchise who will be a free agent.

Hilary highlights California’s missed opportunities for rainwater capture,https://www.latimes.com/california/newsletter/2023-08-30/hilary-drought-rainwater-capture-essential-california,2023-08-30,"Good morning, and welcome to the Essential Californianewsletter. It’sWednesday, Aug. 30.
The epic summer rainfall that Hurricane-turned-Tropical-Storm Hilary dumped on California as it spun across the state last week further reduced drought conditions in regions long dried out.
Nearly all of California’s Mojave Desert has been deemed drought-free after receiving 2 to 6 inches of rain region-wide.
But just as we saw with the parade of atmospheric rivers last winter, our systems were mostly unprepared to hold on to much of that water. That remains an “urgent challenge” to the state as it works to capture more rainwater to replenish depleted groundwater sources,my colleague Grace Toohey reported.
“State and local officials have been actively working to improve methods to capture stormwater, but it’ssimply not been fast enoughto keep up with growing water demands in a more extreme climate — while balancing flood control,” she wrote this week.
Art Castro, a watershed manager for L.A.’s Department of Water and Power, told Grace they captured roughly 3.2 billion gallons from Hilary’s downpour, about a year’s worth of water for 40,000 households.
But that accounts for only about 7% of the water the city has captured since October, he said, citing “limitations of our infrastructure.”
According to the Pacific Institute, California’s urban areas let between 770,000 and 3.9 million acre-feet of water spill away annually (depending on how dry or wet the year is).
“We’re not even coming close to capturing all the runoff,” Mark Gold, the director of water scarcity solutions for the Natural Resources Defense Council, told Grace. “We can definitely do a lot more than what we’re doing.”
Although the vast majority of the state is now out of drought conditions, I’m reminded of a conversation I had with hydroclimatologist Peter Gleick back in April when I wastrying to understand the impact our major rainstorms had on the state’s historic drought.
Gleick, co-founder and senior fellow of the Pacific Institute, told me even though the U.S. Drought Monitor map showed fewer concerning colors in California, the next drought is a matter of when, not if. He hoped the state’s decision-makers would take advantage of a wetter year “to fix other parts of our water system” rather than “forget that we have a water problem because we had a good year.”
“It’s precisely in the wet years, when we have a little breathing room, that we ought to be doing more to prepare for the dry years that we know are increasingly frequent,” he said.

His Lahaina restaurant was a Dodgers paradise. He lost it but says ‘I feel blessed’,https://www.latimes.com/sports/dodgers/story/2023-08-30/dodgers-restaurant-lahaina-fire,2023-08-30,"LAHAINA, Hawaii —In March, my wife and I spent three days in Lahaina, staying two blocks off the now-decimated Front Street. On our first day, arriving after dark and tired from a long flight, we walked a short distance to a nearby Italian restaurant, Penne Pasta, for a late dinner.
As we relaxed, four shelves in a corner caught my eye. They were filled with bobbleheads, and only of Dodgers.
About five dozen of them.
As a lifelong Dodgers fan and Brooklyn native who saw one game in Ebbets Field when I was 7, my curiosity was piqued. I looked around. I was bowled over. Two-thousand-five-hundred miles west of Dodger Stadium was a mother lode of Dodgers memorabilia.
At my request, the smiling chef-owner, Juan Gomez, emerged from the kitchen, chatting with customers — locals and tourists alike — and joined our table. We returned each of the next two days.
As we talked over three meals, Gomez happily told me about the restaurant and of rooting for the Dodgers.
Penne Pasta and everything in it were destroyed whenLahaina was devastated by the monstrous, fast-moving wildfireon Aug. 8 that killed more than 100 people while leaving several hundred missing.
Gomez, 49, had worked nearly half his life at this casual, family-friendly restaurant located on a quiet side street a block and a half from the buzz of touristy Front Street, Lahaina’s main drag.
Starting as a dishwasher at the trattoria in 2001, Gomez moved up the eatery’s echelon — from cook to manager to chef to partner — and he learned the art of Italian cuisine, which he said he knew nothing about previously.
Dodgers
With 50 doubles, the Dodgers’ Freddie Freeman could challenge the MLB all-time single-season record held by an unknown nicknamed the Earl of Doublin’.
That all changed thanks to Gomez’s diligence and restaurant owner Mark Ellman — “my mentor and friend” — who not only taught the apt student the intricacies of being a chef but also how to run a restaurant.
“In 2009, I had started to realize that I wanted to work for myself and have my own restaurant. I brought it up with Mark and told him, ‘When the time comes, I’m going to do it,’” Gomez recalled.
Ellman, who died in February at 67, was a famed Hawaiian chef and restaurant owner. He sold Penne Pasta to Gomez in 2010, financing the loan on his own.
Gomez, who had become a U.S. citizen in 2006, continued to be the chef, developing specialties with his unique touches, such as baked ziti — “our No. 1 seller” — penne puttanesca and chicken piccata, putting in 70 to 80 hours weekly in the kitchen and dining area.
But not every week.
As much as he loved running the restaurant, consisting of about 10 tables inside and on a patio, Gomez also loved the Dodgers. He would take a week or two off each year and fly to Los Angeles, timing those visits with Dodgers home games and attending several of them.
A native of the Mexican state of Jalisco, Gomez became an enormous Dodgers fan thanks to his countryman Fernando Valenzuela.
In 1981, when Gomez was 7, Valenzuela, then 20, captured the attention and hearts of baseball fans in Mexico and the United States. The left-handed hurler from Sonora, whose eyes would look to the heavens before every pitch, helped the Dodgers win the pennant and, for the first time in 16 seasons, the World Series. Valenzuela received the National League Cy Young and rookie of the year, the lone player to win both in the same year.
The only games televised where Gomez lived were when Valenzuela took the mound. And he tried to watch every one of them.
In 1991, when he was 17, Gomez moved to Montebello, where he had completed the ninth grade. He did not return to school. Among his jobs was painting houses. Seeking a better life, he moved to Maui in 1995. But the hours were longer as he washed dishes at another restaurant and picked pineapples.
Dodgers
RJ Peete, the son of former NFL quarterback Rodney Peete and actress Holly Robinson-Peete, hasn’t let autism stop him from living his dream with the Dodgers.
His love for the Dodgers never waned and over the years, he began accumulating what would become a prodigious collection of Dodgers collectibles and memorabilia. They included multiple bobbleheads of Valenzuela, Clayton Kershaw, Vin Scully and Tommy Lasorda and others of less famous Dodgers, such as Cody Bellinger, Jeff Kent, Adrian Gonzalez, Yasiel Puig, Zack Greinke and Joc Pederson. And one of Ecuadorian-born Jaime Jarrín, the club’s longtime Spanish-language broadcaster who retired at the end of the 2022 season after 64 seasons, only three fewer than Scully.
Gomez’s first bobblehead was Paul Lo Duca, a Dodgers catcher from 1998 to 2004. It was a giveaway at Dodger Stadium. But most of Gomez’s collection came as gifts from customers who live on the mainland and would bring them on return visits.
Inside a glass case at Penne Pasta was an eclectic collection: a color photo of Sandy Koufax, a Ron Cey glove and an Austin Barnes 2020 World Series jersey. All were autographed. A giant color photo — perhaps four by eight feet — of a packed, opening-day crowd at Dodger Stadium was reproduced on one wall. All those items were given to Gomez by a friend who worked for the Dodgers.
Erwin Goldbloom still is reeling over the loss of his wife, Linda Goldbloom, who was killed after a foul ball hit her in the head at Dodger Stadium five years ago.
Inside Penne Pasta, every Dodgers game was shown on a huge TV.
During phone interviews since the fire, Gomez has shared the great pain of the disaster.
He lost the restaurant and all his memorabilia — Mark Langill, Dodgers team historian, said he will replace much of it, as “one collector to another” — in the catastrophic blaze, but Gomez knows that his problems are infinitesimal compared to those of others afflicted in the vast tragedy in West Maui.
The aura of death and destruction and shattered hopes will hang over this once-major whaling village for years to come.
“It is very frustrating that the dreams of so many people who worked hard for so many years to build their house, their business, through sweat and tears, and to get something for their family, and in one night ...” Gomez said, his voice trailing off.
“One part of me is gone, but I haven’t lost any family members, and all 10 of our employees, including my sister, Martha Yepez, are accounted for and are safe. I have lost some friends who were customers who became friends. Some of them have died. Some of them are still missing.”
A.J. Wilson, who worked in various capacities for Gomez during the last decade, said in March that Gomez “takes care of me. He’s like my dad.”
World & Nation
They thought the grass fire was contained, but wind conditions were still extreme. Now the decision to pull firefighters away shortly before the Maui fire reignited has become a flashpoint, as questions mount over whether more could have been done to stave off the destruction.
Like the other employees, he is now out of a job.
The restaurant was closed the day of the fire because a camera system at his home showed that Penne Pasta’s power had gone out early that morning, so Gomez and his wife, Esperanza, went there.
“We were trying to keep the food cold by running our generators,” he said.
That evening, with the Gomezes still in the restaurant, the fire quickly closed in.
“It was very windy, and everything started to get black,” he said. “I knew it was a big fire because you could see black smoke that was super, super thick. And you could hear the explosions, either of cars or propane tanks, and they were super loud. Police cars started driving by and broadcasting, ‘You have to go! You have to go!’”
The Gomezes left quickly and avoided getting caught in the large traffic jam of people fleeing. Their home, about a dozen miles away from Lahaina, escaped the fire.
Gomez’s two daughters, who had been visiting from Jalisco, were safe, having returned home a few days before the blaze.
World & Nation
As Maui hotel rooms sit empty after the deadly Hawaii wildfire that devastated Lahaina, some are sounding economic alarms, asking tourists to return.
Gomez has not been allowed to return to where the restaurant used to stand. Security forces initially kept people away as cadaver dogs searched for remains. But from photographs and videos he knows there is nothing left.
For years, Gomez never missed watching a Dodgers game. But he has seen only bits and pieces of games since the blaze. There are far more important things to weigh.
It is unclear what the future holds for the Gomezes.
“This is the longest that I haven’t been working in 28 years. It’s still too early to decide what we want to do,” he said, “and it’s not 100% our decision.”
Insurance issues must be resolved, as he did not own the two-story, wood-frame building that housed the restaurant.
“It’s up to the owners,” Gomez said. “Perhaps we’ll have to relocate. At this point, I don’t have a plan or a decision. I will just go with the flow. I feel calm. I feel blessed. We still have a roof. So many people don’t have anything to go back to. We just have to keep going with our lives. We have to rebuild or move on.”

"With fire risk high, Northern California braces for power shutoffs amid smoky skies",https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2023-08-29/wildfire-risk-northern-california-power-shutoffs-smoky-skies,2023-08-30,"Officials are warning that thousands across Northern California could lose power Wednesday in planned outages as the region faces a critical fire threat — while already dealing with poor air quality amid smoky skies and growing devastation frommultiple ongoing wildfires.
Much of the Sacramento Valley and North Bay Area interior mountains are under ared flag warningfrom late Tuesday through Wednesday,  with gusty winds and low humidity predicted, a combination that forecasters said could cause fire to “rapidly grow in size and intensity.” It is the first red flag warning — indicating the most critical fire conditions —  issued this year by the National Weather Service office in Sacramento, and the first issued since 2021 in the Bay Area’s office.
The weather service urged residents to take precautions to prevent fires and have an emergency plan ready if a fire starts.
World & Nation
When high winds on Maui brought down power poles, the electrical wires were bare, uninsulated metal that could spark on contact with the dry grass below.
Pacific Gas & Electric Co., the state’s largest utility provider, warned that up to 8,000 customers across seven counties should prepare to lose power Wednesday in likely  “public safety power shutoffs.”
“Given the wind event and current conditions, including dry vegetation, PG&E has begun sending advanced notifications to customers — via text, email and automated phone call — in targeted areas where PG&E may need to proactively turn power off for safety to reduce the risk of wildfire from energized powerlines,”the company said in a statement.
The planned outages could begin around 3 a.m. Wednesday, affecting residents mostly on the west side of the Sacramento Valley — where the National Weather Service said there would be the “highest threat” of fire conditions.
🚩RED FLAG WARNING has been issued for the parts of the Sac Valley.⏰ 11 PM Today - 8 PM Wednesday.Breezy northerly winds + low humidity will lead to critical fire weather conditions in the warning area.This is NWS Sacramento's first Red Flag Warning of 2023.#CAwx#CAfirepic.twitter.com/VIqVsmwsaU
The majority of affected residents are in Shasta and Tehama counties, but pockets of Colusa, Glenn, Lake, Napa and Yolo counties could also see planned outages,according to PG&E. Utility officials said the shutoffs were meant to “stop catastrophic wildfires by proactively turning off power when extreme weather threatens our electric grid.”
It wasn’t immediately clear how long the shutoffs might last.
Already north and west of this region, multiple wildfires — mostly sparked by lightning strikes earlier this month — are burning in primarily remote areas, with heavy smoke spreading well beyond the blazes’ perimeters.
California
Cal Fire is the first fire agency to use artificial intelligence to look for signs of wildfires and directly alert dispatch centers.
The Bay Area Air Quality Management Districtagain warnedof poor air quality Tuesday as a result of growing smoke plumes drifting south from fires in Northern California and Oregon. Smoky skies have prompted air quality warnings almost every day in the last week.
The largest of the fires had burned 74,000 acres along the Oregon border in Six Rivers National Forest by Tuesday morning, with crews working urgently to secure a perimeter before conditions worsen early Wednesday. The Smith River Complex fire has prompted evacuations,closed much of the national forestand remained only 7% contained, according to theincident command team.
Farther south, but still primarily in the Six Rivers National Forest, federal officials are responding to a web of 20 wildfires burning across 11,000 acres, making up the Six Rivers National Forest Lightning Complex and Redwood Lightning Complex. The wildfire complex was 20% contained Tuesday morning,according to federal officials.
California
The Happy Camp Complex in the Klamath National Forest has scorched at least 11,616 acres and was 4% contained as of Wednesday morning.
The Happy Camp Complex fire, burning more than 22,000 acres in the Klamath National Forest, hasalready killed one personand destroyed nine structures, with 1,600 structures threatened. As of Tuesday, it was 31% contained,officials said.
Gov. Gavin Newsom declared a state of emergency in Del Norte and Siskiyou counties due to the Smith River Complex and Happy Camp Complex fires, respectively. The proclamation waives fees and licensing requirements for out-of-state contractors to help restore utility infrastructure. It also waives fees for official documents, such as marriage and birth certificates or driver’s licenses, that may have been lost in the fire.
Also 31% contained was the South Fork Complex fire, straddling the border of the Shasta-Trinity and Six Rivers national forests, mostly in Humboldt County. Both national forests have closed areas surrounding the fires, which in total make up 3,000 acres,officials said.

"Is California’s wildfire season finally over? Don’t bet on it, experts say",https://www.latimes.com/environment/story/2023-09-29/is-the-california-wildfire-season-over,2023-09-29,"California has entered fall amid notably moist conditions that have left some wondering whether this year’s fire season has officially fizzled.
The state has seen about 276,000 acres burn so far this year — significantly less than the five-year average of 1,158,028 acres for the same year-to-date period, according to the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection.
Experts said much of the mildness can be attributed to historic rains that soaked the state this year, includingmore than 30 atmospheric riversthat caused major flooding andrecord snowpackin the winter and spring, and arare tropical stormthat barreled through Southern California in August.
Aggressive and impactful reporting on climate change, the environment, health and science.
But while it’s tempting to call this year a washout, recent storms have alsospurred new vegetation growththat could act as fuel, Cal Fire officials said. What’s more, gusty fall winds that have been known to fan flames have yet to arrive in full force, and are most common from September to May.
“Fire season is not over,” said Nick Schuler, Cal Fire’s deputy director of communications and emergency incident awareness. “The important thing that people recognize is living in California, we live in a Mediterranean climate where wildfire is always a threat.”
Still, the season has been undeniably mild so far. Should those conditions persist, California will experience itssecond consecutive yearof mild fire activity. Last year, fewer than 363,000 acres burned.
The two years prior, 2020 and 2021, wereCalifornia’s worst wildfire seasons on record, with 4.3 million and 2.6 million acres burned, respectively.
Park Williams, a climate scientist at UCLA, said he thinks California may be “out of the woods” for a very large forest fire this year, but that all the new growth spurred by the rains could make for dangerous conditions in 2024.
“We know that there’s a lot of fuel available, but we also know it’s really wet, and so it would take a pretty big, bad-luck-convergence of factors to create fire this year,” Williams said. “I think it’s much more likely that next year is the big fire danger year.”
This year has been exceptionally damp, with statewide precipitation now at141% of normal, according to the Department of Water Resources.
Though Williams said he believes a large wildland fire is unlikely this year, it’s not impossible — particularly if a prolonged wind event arrives to dry vegetation before the winter rains appear.
Already this week,wind advisorieswere issued in Santa Barbara and Ventura counties, where sundowner winds delivered gusts of 50 mph overnight Wednesday and Thursday, according to the National Weather Service.
“When you have Santa Ana winds — winds that come from the east and blow to the west — it dries everything out,” said Schuler, of Cal Fire. “If you look at some of the largest fires in California’s history, especially Southern California, they started later in the year.”
California
Photos from space show the difference rainfall from Tropical Storm Hilary made to the landscape of Southern California.
The state’s fifth-largest fire on record, theCreek fire, ignited in September 2020 and burned about 380,000 acres in Fresno and Madera counties, destroying 858 structures.
Another of the state’s largest fires, 2017’sdeadly and destructive Thomas fire, didn’t ignite until December that year. It burned 282,000 acres in Ventura and Santa Barbara counties, killing two people.
This year’s largest fire — the Smith River Complex burning near the Oregon border — has stayed under 100,000 acres, although the fireknocked out powerto Del Norte County for nearly a month.
This week, anearly season atmospheric riverdropped 4 inches of rain in the area, helping to quell the blaze.
Aside from the wetter conditions, Schuler said state efforts are also making a difference — includingnew firefighting aircraftthat can fly faster, carry more water and fight fires at night, andnew artificial intelligence technologythat is helping fire officials catch and respond to fires faster.
California is also making gains on defensible space inspections, fuel-reduction work and prescribed burns, he said. (Fuel reduction includes removing vegetation from forest areas that could burn in a fire, while prescribed burns are fires that are intentionally set to similarly reduce vegetation.)
But with the threat of dryness and the potential for strong winds in the future, he said Californians should not let their guard down and should continue to clear vegetation from their properties and maintain defensible space.
“While we have seen cooler weather, it’s not a time to be lulled into a false sense of security,” he said.
California
Disasters like the Lahaina fire are becoming increasingly likely as warmer temperatures, development, and land management policies create conditions ripe for fire.
Indeed, fire season hasnot been so mild everywhere. On Maui, Hawaii, a deadly blaze tore through the historic town of Lahaina in August and killed at least 97 people — thedeadliest U.S. wildfirein a century.
In Greece  over the summer, at least 28 people were killed asdozens of wildfiresburned, including a July fire on Rhodes that sent more than 20,000 people fleeing for safety.
And in Canada, massive fires have burned nearly 40 million acres this year, spewing thick smoke thatchoked the East Coast and Midwestin some of the worst air quality they’ve ever seen.
Williams said those blazes exemplified how much “fire loves heat,” and noted that  thesummer was the hottest on recordin the Northern Hemisphere.
He hoped officials were using the cooler, wetter conditions in California this year to finish as many fuel reduction projects as possible, but said ultimately, the rain is to thank for the mild season so far.
“Climate really runs the show in terms of how much burns — and at what intensity — in California and across the West,” he said.

"Clippers say they aren’t sending messages, but Paul George and Kawhi Leonard need to play",https://www.latimes.com/sports/clippers/story/2023-09-27/clippers-training-camp-lawrence-frank-kawhi-leonard-paul-george,2023-09-27,"Kawhi LeonardandPaul Georgewere injured when the lastClippersseason ended in April. When the new one begins next week, the stars — whose arrival four years ago heralded championship aspirations not yet realized because of injuries  — will be in uniform and healthy to play.
When the team holds its first practice of training camp Tuesday in Hawaii, both will be “full participants,”Lawrence Frank, the Clippers’ president of basketball operations, said during his annual preseason address.
If one question about their present availability appears settled, another about their futures with the team has not been resolved.
Both Leonard and George, who are beginning their fifth seasons in Los Angeles, can become unrestricted free agents next summer if they choose to not exercise the final year of their contracts, a player option worth $48 million apiece that covers the 2024-25 season. Leonard has been eligible for a contract extension since mid-July, and George since Sept. 1. Both can sign for a maximum of up to four years and $220 million.
Frank said the franchise’s goal is “still trying to maximize Kawhi and PG’s window and take advantage of it,” but deals have not materialized — just as a new contract, with a raise, sought bycoach Tyronn Luethis offseason also did not come to fruition, with the team instead guaranteeing the final year of Lue’s contract, for 2024-25.
Asked whether the team was sending a message by not rushing into locking itself into long-term deals with three of its pillars, Frank said “not at all.”
Clippers
KTLA will show all four Clippers exhibition games in addition to 11 regular-season games. Bally Sports will continue to carry most of the Clippers games.
“All of us feel a tremendous responsibility and indebtedness to [team owner Steve Ballmer], to our fans, to the fellow people we work with to make sure that we’re able to perform and give our best,” Frank said. “In terms of T. Lue, I don’t know — he has two years. So we love T. Lue. We want T. Lue to be the coach here for a long time; he’s one of the elite coaches in this league and there’s always a timing for things like that.
“PG and Kawhi, we have very, very candid conversations in terms of the goal is to keep them as Clippers. It’s not a warning shot but I think all of us, me included, you feel a tremendous amount of responsibility and you take ownership for your piece of the pie, so to speak of how we each can do better for each other and ultimately for all our fans.”
Frank added that all players on the roster are expected to be healthy for the start of camp, though who is on that roster remains subject to change. The contract of third-year point guardJason Prestonbecomes guaranteed Sunday, so the team must decide  whether  to waive or keep him.
A three-team trade to send Damian Lillard to the Milwaukee Bucks also could grow larger yet if the Portland Trail Blazers opt to move incoming guard Jrue Holiday, the Los Angeles native who is one of the NBA’s top defenders and has earned Leonard and George’s respect. The Clippers already have discussed their interest in Holiday internally.
Clippers
The Clippers’ trip to Hawaii in October for training camp will end with a preseason game that will double as a benefit for the state’s recovery from wildfires.
Also, the Clippers have been at the top of James Harden’s list of desired destinations since July, as the guard has made his unhappiness staying in Philadelphia clear and demanded a trade. Frank could not comment on speculation, instead repeating the philosophy on team-building he has voiced since he took over six years ago.
“We like our group, we like our team,” Frank said. “You are always looking for ways to get better, both individually and as a team. Typically if you just follow the probability the greatest way to get better is internal improvement, but from our standpoint we’ll always be aggressive trying to find ways to improve the team.”

Highland fire forced residents to flee. ‘I went outside and couldn’t breathe’,https://www.latimes.com/environment/story/2023-10-31/highland-fire-doubles-in-size-in-riverside-county-burning-structures,2023-11-01,"A bright orange hue enveloped Carol Rogers’ neighborhood as she fled from her home in Aguanga on Monday afternoon.
Nearby, theburgeoning Highland firewas chewing through dried grasses as hot Santa Ana winds whipped it into a blaze. Rogers tried to gather her important documents, medicine and laptop but couldn’t think clearly and left with the clothes she was wearing and her slippers.
“I didn’t realize it was that bad until I went outside and couldn’t breathe,” Rogers said. “Nobody came to tell us.”
By Tuesday night, the Riverside County fire had exploded to 2,487 acres with 10% containment, according to the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection. About 4,000 people were under mandatory evacuation orders, and at least three homes had been destroyed. Six other structures had been damaged, and an estimated 2,356 were threatened by the fire, Cal Fire reported.
More than 1,100 firefighters were attacking the fire from the air and the ground, the department reported at 7 p.m. Tuesday, but with more dry conditions and 50 mph wind gusts in the forecast, they faced an uphill battle.
“We’re looking at single-digit humidity this afternoon,” said Philip Gonsalves, a meteorologist with the weather service in San Diego, which includes Riverside County in its coverage area. “From a weather perspective, conditions are favorable for fire growth.”
In total, 1,139 homes remainunder evacuation orders, and 489 homes under an evacuation warning, Cal Fire officials said.
“We just ask that the public please remain vigilant,” public information officer Maggie Cline De La Rosa said in avideo update. “If you received an evacuation order, please leave. If you received an evacuation warning, please continue to pay close attention to those.”
Though a Red Cross reception center was opened at Great Oak High School in Temecula, many residents of the unincorporated area opted to decamp to the nearby parking lots of Walmart, CVS and the Pechanga Resort in their RVs.
“You gotta treat it like a holiday. What else are ya gonna do?” said Yvonne LeMay as she leaned against a lawn chair in front of Walmart, soot drizzling from the sky. “We’ve got RVs. We’ve been doing it for 20 years.”
“Well, I’m not used to it,” shot back her friend, Tracy Anderson, who leaned against her white truck to hide from the sizzling sun.
Anderson said she checked into a Holiday Inn Express and recognized others from their community. She was eager to return to her home — and a very hungry cat she couldn’t get in time — but knew she needed a distraction to keep her mind off it.
California
A wildfire broke out near the town of Aguanga in Riverside County on Monday, burning more than 1,200 acres and causing evacuations and road closures.
The fire was burning in an area that only recently was saturated byTropical Storm Hilary, a rare storm that tore through swaths of Southern California in August. Gonsalves, of the weather service, said the storm’s rainfall contributed to “green-up” in the area, or the growth of new grasses, which may have subsequently dried out and could be feeding the fire.
It’s something experts warned of in the weeks after Hilary made landfall. Nick Schuler, Cal Fire’s deputy director of communications and emergency incident awareness, said in Septemberthat fire season was not overand that a prolonged wind event could still fan a blaze.
“When you have Santa Ana winds — winds that come from the east and blow to the west — it dries everything out,” Schuler said. “If you look at some of the largest fires in California’s history, especially Southern California, they started later in the year.”
Indeed, Santa Ana winds have driven many major fires in Southern California, said Luca Carmignani, a University of California Cooperative Extension wildfire advisor based at the UC South Coast Research and Extension Center in Irvine. The winds originate inland, gaining speed, warming up and drying out as they move from higher to lower elevations and squeeze through narrow canyons and passes.
Ignitions that occur without wind or dryness can usually be managed, but strong winds make it easy for flames to propagate to the rest of the vegetation.
“It’s like blowing on a barbecue — you invigorate the flames, you invigorate the combustion process so the fire can spread much, much better and faster,” Carmignani said.
He said it’s not yet clear whether growth from this year’s storms directly contributed to the spread of the Highland fire but noted that Southern California, wheremost of the state’s large fireshave taken place this year, is characterized by shrublands.
“These plants tend to burn completely when they burn, and their natural regimen is to have less frequent fires,” he said. “So a fire happens on a less regular basis, but when they happen, they tend to burn the vegetation more intensely.”
Rob Roseen, a public information officer with Cal Fire in Riverside, said Tuesday that the Highland fire was burning in light grasses and medium brush.Remote mountaintop camerasin the area showed billowing plumes of white smoke.
“We’ll have an increased augmentation of ground resources today,” Roseen said. “They’ll be bolstered by numerous resources that will be working in the area, as well as our fixed-wing and helicopter assets that will be working over the fire throughout the day to try to build some containment on this.”
Roseen could not immediately confirm what types of structures had been destroyed. The cause of the fire remains under investigation, he said.
But the dry, windy conditions fueled several other small fires across the state, including the Lizzie fire in San Luis Obispo, which was 35% contained at 100 acres Tuesday. Crews in San Diego were also battling a small brush fire near Interstate 805 in Kearny Mesa.
In the unincorporated area of Aromas, on the border of San Benito and Monterey counties, a small fire ignited around 2 a.m. Tuesday and prompted brief evacuation orders. The fire was contained to a small water district maintenance yard, officials said.
Climate & Environment
Recent storms have dampened conditions but have also spurred new vegetation that could act as fuel for fires. Also, strong fall winds have yet to arrive.
The Highland fire was proving harder to fight.
Lona Miller said her father and stepmother, George and Luci Boyles, lost their house to the blaze on Monday. Fifteen years ago, they bought their 10-acre property located about a mile off of Highway 371; they had just paid it off two months ago, Miller said.
George called his daughter as the flames were moving in. He was able to escape with a few items and his seven dogs but not much else, Miller said. Before he left, he snapped aphoto of the house ablaze, and he believes there is nothing left.
“He’s like, ‘I don’t know what to do — I’ve never been in this situation,’ ” Miller said of her father. “All they were able to grab was a couple of clothes, my sister’s ashes and the dogs. They have five cats, but they’re indoor-outdoor and he couldn’t get ahold of them so we don’t know if they made it. He had to open up his chicken coop and shoo all the chickens out. He’s like, ‘I don’t know what’s left up there, but the house was completely on fire.’ ”
Rogers, the Aguanga resident who fled in her slippers Monday afternoon, said she believed her home was still standing, but she wasn’t sure how livable it would be. Drone footage she saw from another person camped in the Walmart lot showed her whole area was pitch black.
“It’s been the worst one. It came through so fast and so close,” she said.
An array of packaged baked goods were scattered in her vehicle. As winds picked up, her throat started to itch. Rogers hadn’t worked at her Smog Check business for the past month because she had a lung removed in June and was advised by her physical therapist to try not to breathe in any toxins. She chuckled at the situation she was in.
“I’m going to sit here and hope they open up the freeway,” she said. “There’s nothing really else to do.”

Fires ignite as Santa Ana winds raise danger of quick-moving flames,https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2023-10-30/several-fires-southern-california-ongoing-santa-ana-wind-event,2023-10-31,"
The season’sfirst Santa Ana wind eventwas expected to last through Monday night, and it brought dangerous fire conditions to Southern California. Several small brush fires ignited Sunday across Los Angeles and Ventura counties, and a major fire erupted Monday in Riverside County.
High winds and low humidity increased the fire risk and  brought the threat of preventive power shutoffs to almost 70,000 customers in L.A. and Ventura counties, according to Southern California Edison.
Most of the blazes that ignited Sunday — including in West Hills, North Hollywood, Wilmington,Santa Anaand Camarillo— appeared to be contained or under control by Monday morning, with none exceeding more than a couple of acres, fire officials said.
“Right now we’re fortunate we haven’t seen any larger fires,” Robbie Munroe said Monday morning. But the National Weather Service meterologist cautioned, “That’s something we could see on a day like today. With the strong winds and very dry conditions, rapid fire growth can occur.”
By late Monday, those concerns were realized in Riverside County, where a blaze dubbed theHighland fire ballooned to more than 1,200 acresnear Aguanga, prompting evacuation orders.
But even with thehistorically dangerousoffshore wind pattern, UCLA climate scientist Daniel Swain said he expected any fire activity to remain  more limited compared with prior years because of one key factor: moist fuels.
“The lack of exceptionally dry vegetation makes firefighting much more tractable,” Swainsaid at a virtual briefing Monday. “The fuels are providing a bit of impediment.”
This year’s unexpectedly wet weather — which included arecord-setting snowpackand asummer tropical storm— has helped keep wildfires at bay across the state, Swain said, even when facing the latest warm, dry wind events.
“You can get extreme fire weather conditions from low humidity and strong winds, but if the vegetation isn’t dry enough to support extreme fire behavior, you often aren’t going to get it,” he said.
Santa Ana windsup to 70 mph blew into the region Sunday. At the Magic Mountain Truck Trail in the San Gabriel Mountains, the strongest gust was recorded at 104 mph early Monday, according tothe National Weather Service.
Red Flag Warnings remain in effect for much of LA/Ventura counties through 10 pm Monday. Dangerous fire weather conditions due to strong Santa Ana winds + very low humidities. In addition, there will be threat of downed trees/ powerlines and  power outages.#LAWeather#cawxpic.twitter.com/SLJ7GTZJqp
A red flag warning — an alert for dangerous fire weather — was set to remain in effect through 10 p.m. Monday for much of L.A. and Ventura counties, with concerns of widespread wind gusts around 40 to 60 mph in the mountains, valleys and some coasts along the the Santa Ana wind corridor, and isolated gusts near 70 mph.
When gusts exceed 58 mph, Munroe said, downed trees and power lines become a major concern, as does road travel for high-profile vehicles. The city of Los Angeles remained under red flag parking restrictions, limiting street parking indesignated areasto ensure emergency vehicles can quickly respond.
Winds were expected to be the strongest in the western San Fernando Valley and the Santa Clarita Valley.
Climate & Environment
Recent storms have dampened conditions but have also spurred new vegetation that could act as fuel for fires. Also, strong fall winds have yet to arrive.
High winds are also a concern through Tuesday in the Inland Empire, San Bernardino and Riverside county mountains, San Gorgonio Pass near Banning, the Santa Ana Mountains and inland Orange County.
“We are expecting the worst of the winds through this afternoon, especially early afternoon,” Munroe said Monday morning. “Then we should be on a downward trend this afternoon and evening.”
Thousands in Ventura County were either already without power or imminently threatened to lose power, due to public safety power shutoffs during the wind event, according to thecounty’s online emergency dashboard.
Southern California Edison saidabout 2,000 customers in San Bernardino were without power due to the safety shutoffs, as well as about 500 in L.A. and Ventura counties, and thousands more were under alert for possible shutoffs.
A freeze warning was also issued for  Tuesday morning for the Antelope Valley.
Swain says he is increasingly confident that this year will remaina relatively calmfire year, given that high fuel moisture. But he said that’s no indication of California’s future. The state  is likely to continue experiencing a type of climate whiplash in the face of global warming — with extremely dry years followed by exceptionally wet seasons.
“Inevitably, the pendulum is going to swing back the other way,” Swain said. “Unfortunately, 2017, 2018, 2019, 2020 — these terrible fire years — I don’t think those were an anomaly or a blip. ... We will be back there a few years from now, and we could be in a worse place at some point in the future.”

Santa Ana winds lead to parking restrictions in Los Angeles amid fire concerns,https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2023-10-29/santa-ana-winds-lead-to-parking-restrictions-in-los-angeles-area-amid-fire-concerns,2023-10-30,"Parking restrictions are in effect in parts of Los Angeles where fire officials have determined that roads need to be clear for potential evacuations — the latest precaution against possible wildfires as strong Santa Ana winds hit Southern California.
A red flag warning for Los Angeles and Ventura counties will last through at least Monday, with rapid spread expected if a fire were to start, fanned by gusts of 35 to 65 mph in some spots, according to the National Weather Service.
National Weather Services officials reported that peak winds Sunday reached 92 mph near Magic Mountain Truck Trail in the Santa Clarita area.At Boney Mountainin the Santa Monica Mountains, winds hit 70 mph.
Southern California Edison officials  warned customers thatprecautionary power shutoffscould be necessary to prevent fires.
Calabasas officials said early Sunday that Edison, which provides power to most of the city, could implement a public safety power shutoff “for virtually ALL circuits” there  because of the strong winds. “Downed power lines can ignite dry brush and cause wildfires,”the city said on X, formerly Twitter. By about 9 p.m. Sunday, some residents had lost power as shutoff areas included a swath north of the 101 Freeway, affecting some residents of Calabasas and Agoura, and a strip extending south from Mulholland Highway at Las Virgenes Road into Malibu.

About  1,600 Southern California Edison customers in Los Angeles County and  fewer than 100 in Orange County were affected by precautionary power shutoffs as of Sunday night.
According to the power company, a total of more than 150,000 customers have been warned that they could lose power.
In Los Angeles, vehicles may be towed in areas where parked cars could pose a problem for firefighters or for evacuees needing to get out of the city quickly, such as very narrow roads, hairpin turns, tight curves and intersections that could create “a choke point,” according to the Los Angeles Fire Department.
Drivers can type an address intothe Fire Department’s websiteto see whether the red flag parking restrictions, which are in effect until at least Monday morning, apply.
In parts of the Antelope Valley, Salinas Valley and San Luis Obispo County, residents will also be dealing with cold temperatures. Those areas are under a freeze warning, with temperatures as low as 25 degrees expected Monday and Tuesday.
Weather officials advise that people facing freeze warnings bring their animals inside, protect sensitive crops and keep a windshield scraper handy.
Parts of the San Francisco Bay Area, including the San Mateo coast and Santa Clara hills, were also facing powerful winds and red flag warnings this weekend.
“People need to just be careful right now with anything that could ignite a fire, because if it gets started in the right spot, it has the potential to spread very quickly,” said Rich Thompson, a meteorologist with the Los Angeles/Oxnard National Weather Service office.
Activities that should be avoided include tossing cigarettes out of moving vehicles and leaving a campfire smoldering, Thompson said.
Last fall, strong Santa Ana winds and red flag warnings downed trees and left thousands of Southern Californians without power during the Thanksgiving holiday.
“This is a very typical Santa Ana event. It’s nothing unusual for this time of the year,” Thompson said.

"David Lehrer, civil rights lawyer and longtime L.A. Jewish leader, dies at 75",https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2023-10-28/david-lehrer-civil-rights-lawyer-dies-at-75,2023-10-28,"David A. Lehrer, a longtime leader in Los Angeles’ Jewish community and attorney who helped draft the state’s hate crime laws, has died. He was 75.
He collapsed Wednesday at his Los Feliz home and could not be revived, his family said in a statement.
Lehrer worked for almost 30 years in the West Coast office of the Anti-Defamation League, joining the ADL in 1975 as a civil rights attorney and later being promoted to regional director.
He also led legislative efforts to outlaw tax-subsidized discrimination at private social clubs, including theJonathan Club, and confronted neo-Nazi and other extremist groups in the West.
Lehrer, a lifelong resident of Los Feliz, was an active longtime member of Temple Israel of Hollywood “and will be greatly missed by all who knew, worked with and loved him,” his family said.
Lehrer was a first-generation Angeleno, born to parents who fled Europe to escape antisemitism.
His mother, Gertrude “Trudy” Lehrer,escaped Vienna in 1938just afterKristallnacht, or “the Night of Broken Glass,” when Nazis burned synagogues, destroyed Jewish businesses and homes and killed Jewish people in Germany and Austria.
California
From a Times Staff Writer Los Angeles attorney Amanda Susskind has been named director of the Anti-Defamation League’s Los Angeles regional office, officials said Thursday.
“Had she not gotten the visa for the United States, undoubtedly she would have perished in Austria and [in] the concentration camp,” Lehrer said in a tribute video for his mother’s 100th birthday.
Lehrer died a year after his mother, who was a week shy of her 103rd birthday when she died in the same home, his family said.
He was born Oct. 12, 1948, to Trudy and Irving Abraham Lehrer. He decided he wanted to be an attorney around 13, when he read “My Life in Court,” a 1961 memoir by trial attorney Louis Nizer.
“He never changed his mind — he just wanted to be a lawyer,” his younger brother, Michael, said Friday.
After graduating from UCLA School of Law in 1973, Lehrer joined a private firm where, a few years into it, he realized he was unhappy, his brother said.
“He realized, ‘Why am I spending my time working to defend people and things I don’t really care about?’” Michael said.
As an attorney at ADL, Lehrer appealed to the California Coastal Commissionin 1985 to declinethe request of the Jonathan Club — which leased 58,000 square feet of public land for its beachfront location — to improve its Santa Monica property unless the club enforced a nondiscrimination policy.
After a three-year legal battle, the U.S. Supreme Courtupheld the state court’s decision, which had agreed the coastal panel was within its purview to demand the club enforce such a policy. The decision affected other wealthy social clubs around Los Angeles with a history of accepting only white Christian men.
“It’s a part of the process of eliminating this last vestige of institutional bigotry, the country club and the downtown club, that are small enclaves of discrimination,” Lehrer told The Times in 1988.
Longtime Times columnist Al Martinez wrote during the case that he’d known Lehrer many years and observed his fervent dedication to civil rights.
“He can identify an antisemite in a room full of liberals while blindfolded, picking the racist out by only his vibrations, like a tiger shark selects its next meal,” Martinez wrote in 1985.
In 1998, Lehrer was one of the first Jewish leaders to work with Muslim leaders and developed a code of ethics with them in 1998 to promote civil debate.
After 27 years with the ADL, Lehrer was fired in 2001, a controversial move by the organization’s New York leadership — with whom Lehrer had political and personal disagreements — that was decried by many faith leaders in L.A.,The Times reported. (He, privately and recently, made up with the man who fired him, his family said.)
“Probably he is paying the price for the more balanced view he took toward Muslims,” Aslam Abdullah, vice president of the Muslim Public Affairs Council,said at the time.
Lehrer bounced back quickly, working withcommunity activist Joe Hicksto form Community Advocates, a nonprofit focused on race and human relations. The organization published articles, led programs and helped develop educational curricula aimed at promoting tolerance, his family said in a statement.
In 2017, Lehrer was alarmed by the rhetoric of President Trump and his travel ban on Muslim-majority countries, and also disappointed that the  Jewish community wasn’t raising its voice  against the Trump administration’s outrageous policies, said former county Supervisor Zev Yaroslavsky, who knew Lehrer for 50 years.
California
It appeared to be business as usual Saturday at the Jonathan Club despite a California Coastal Commission decision that could force the club to adopt a nondiscrimination policy if it wants to expand its facilities.
Lehrer, Yaroslavsky and other prominent Jewish leaders launched Jews United for Democracy and Justice, an organization focused on protecting the country’s constitutional democracy.
The group produced “America at a Crossroads,” a weekly online discussion hosting prominent experts and L.A. journalists.
On Thursday, attorney and longtime activist Janice Kamenir-Reznik, his co-host, opened the show in honor of Lehrer.
Kamenir-Reznik said more than 1,000 viewers emailed her after hearing of Lehrer’s death, noting that many told her that although they’d never met him, they felt as if they’d lost a beloved friend.
“David was a magnificent tapestry of the most positive human characteristics,” Kamenir-Reznik said. “He was soft yet tough, bold yet humble, always ready to speak truth to power, to call out injustice and false information, and he was wise beyond measure.”
Lehrer was aware of the enormous threats to the U.S. Constitution and democracy — but unwilling to yield to despair about the future, she said.

L.A. County is launching CARE Court. Here’s what to expect,https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2023-11-30/l-a-county-launches-gov-newsom-care-couirt,2023-11-30,"Gov. Gavin Newsom’s mental health program known as CARE Court arrives in Los Angeles County on Friday, with officials expressing optimism that it will help with the homelessness crisis.
“We know that there are too many people with severe mental illness who are living on the streets,” Board of Supervisors Chair Janice Hahn said at a Thursday news conference. “We’ve all seen them, and so far, we’ve been unable to reach them or give them the care that they need. ... That’s why what we’re doing here today is so important.”
The L.A. County Department of Mental Health, first responders, family members, roommates or spouseswill be able to petitionthe court to start the process of enrolling someone into the state-funded program.
Those petitioned can attend their private CARE Court proceedings either virtually, in person at the Norwalk courthouse orat one of 12 county courthouses with free private spacesfor people involved in hearings.
Signed into law by Newsom in 2022, the CARE Actrequires every county in Californiato open the specialized courts that offer voluntary treatment and services. This differs from assisted outpatient treatment, a more restrictive form of court-involved treatment.
Officials estimate that 4,500 people in L.A. County could be enrolled in CARE Court in the first year.
Seven counties — San Diego, Orange, Glenn, Riverside, Stanislaus, Tuolumne and San Francisco — were the first to implement the CARE Act. Their courts opened on Oct. 1, and two months in, provide a glimpse of what L.A. County might expect.
Rural counties have seen less interest than urban counties. Glenn County, north of Sacramento  in the Sacramento Valley, has not received any petitions, according to behavioral health director Joe Hallett.
California
CARE courts open in several California counties Oct. 2. Some families and others question the voluntary-compliance aspect of the mental illness law.
Nine petitions have been filed in Stanislaus County, and one has been approved, said county Supervisor Terry Withrow, who described some of the challenges getting people into a CARE plan. Notable is the lack of documentation; petitioners must provide proof of a psychiatric hospitalization.
In Southern California, the legislation is starting to have a more conspicuous effect.
The CARE Court in Orange County has received 35 petitions. Fourteen met the CARE Act criteria and have advanced to the Department of Public Health. Of those 14, one was dismissed, and for eight others, the 14-day deadline was extended so the individual could be located.
“The remaining difference is in flux,” said Veronica Kelley, behavioral health director for Orange County. “The judge might have received partial paperwork or wanted to give the petitioner more time.”
Twenty petitions have been filed in Riverside County, according to a spokesperson, with dozens of inquiries —- for those who did not meet criteria — referred to behavioral health services for follow-up.
San Diego County’s CARE Court has received 42 petitions. Two were dismissed by the judge, and the rest were sent to Behavioral Health Services, which dismissed six others. Thirty-four are active, said Luke Bergmann, the county’s behavioral health  director.
When asked about the rollout of the CARE Act during a news conference on Monday,  Newsom described the program as a “pilot effort” so far and expressed  confidence that the original estimate — between 7,000 and 12,000 people brought into the program — would be realized “in a matter of years.”
“I’m excited about what it promotes and promises,” he said.
California
Los Angeles County is poised to join the first wave of counties to launch a sweeping new mental health plan pushed by Gov. Gavin Newsom.
L.A. County was originally slated to open its CARE Court in 2024.
At Thursday’s news conference, Hahn said the countymoved up its launchin part because she and Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass worked together to model a different behavior in the local politics, “not pointing fingers, not assigning blame, particularly for the homelessness crisis.”
Historically, the city and county have had a complex, at times cantankerous, relationship around who should be funding services and who is in charge of which aspects of addressing the thousands of people sleeping outside each night in L.A. County.
Hahn said the voters have given the city and county billions of dollars to build housing and shelters, practice street medicine andfinance outreach teams to get peopleinto mental health care.
“But the status quo just wasn’t working for everybody,” Hahn said. “And we felt so strongly that CARE Court was that missing piece of the puzzle.”
To qualify for CARE Court, a person must be at least 18 and have schizophrenia or another psychotic disorder. Those with bipolar disorder, regardless of whether they have psychotic symptoms, do not qualify under current law.
Generally, a participant’s  illness must be keeping them from carrying out day-to-day tasks. They can’t already be receiving treatment in a voluntary treatment program. They must be getting sicker and  in danger of not surviving without supervision, or  need supervision to better ensure they won’t grow sicker.
CARE Court has to be the least restrictive option for them — meaning the court would find that the person wouldn’t succeed by simply being enrolled at a county outpatient mental health clinic to regularly see a therapist. And the court must find that CARE Court would benefit the person.
Civil rights advocates have long expressed concerns that CARE Court will lead to more people being forced into involuntary treatment, and that the effort is overall a misguided way to help people.
Jason Robison, chief program officer ofSHARE!, a nonprofit mental health and housing provider, said Thursday that research has shown for decades that people with serious mental illnesses and substance use disorders must receive social support and social relationships — like those found in self-help groups — to recover.
California
Los Angeles County is poised to join the first wave of counties to launch a sweeping new mental health plan pushed by Gov. Gavin Newsom.
“That’s the thing that our system of mental health services is really not good at, and it’s the thing that CARE Court is not addressing,” Robison said. “Because [CARE Court] is focusing on making sure somebody is going to be compliant with medication and is going to see a treatment team.”
CARE Court places the accountability to succeed on the person being petitioned to court, not on the service providers who too often try to force compliance and control, rather than slowing down and addressing the needs of the person, he said.
Every CARE Court participant in L.A. County will be represented by the Independent Defense Counsel’s Office, housed in theL.A. County Public Defender’s officebut independently operated.
Marco Saenz, who leads the team of 50 CARE Court attorneys, said that in addition to protecting the civil liberties of the individual in CARE Court, the attorneys will also be charged with doing what’s in the best clinical interest of the client.
That also means ensuring that if the client does not want to participate, they aren’t forced to.
“In this system, the attorney is there to make sure the [looming punishment] isn’t created, that the system remains voluntary, that the threat of involuntary medication, involuntary institutionalization, those very real concerns that are rational for people to have, that there’s some sort of safeguard,” said L.A. County Public Defender Ricardo Garcia.

Mountains of holiday food and packing waste are clogging landfills. Is there a better way?,https://www.latimes.com/environment/story/2023-12-31/holiday-food-and-packing-waste-are-clogging-landfills,2023-12-31,"‘Twas the week after Christmas, and in a quiet corner of the San Fernando Valley, lines of waste collection trucks waited to offload their goods onto a growing mountain of garbage.
Here at the Athens Materials Recovery Facility in Sun Valley, cardboard boxes careened down conveyor belts, empty bottles and cans flew through crushers and sorters, and hand crews sifted through soggy recyclables.
Wrapping paper, aluminum trays and Amazon logos were a near-constant among the detritus.
“We get a lot more boxes during this time of year for sure,” said Fabiola Martinez, an operations lead with Athens Services, which handles much of the waste hauling and recycling in Los Angeles and other nearby areas.
Aggressive and impactful reporting on climate change, the environment, health and science.
According to waste haulers, managers and researchers, the holiday season provides a visible and tangible surge in trash. In L.A., the buildup is particularly acute after Christmas, when people begin to dispose of heaps of food, wrapping paper and shipping boxes. The city collected 2.04 tons of cardboard in December 2022 compared with 16.42 tons in January 2023, according to data provided by Los Angeles Sanitation & Environment. January also saw 96.78 tons of Christmas trees.
For waste haulers and recycling plant managers across the state, this tidal wave of rubbish brings its own peculiar risks and challenges. For environmentalists, this flood of cardboard and wrapping paper is Exhibit A for why Californians need to lead more sustainable lives, and consume less.
Robert Reed, spokesman for the Bay Area’s largest waste management company, Recology, said waste volume peaks in the three days after Christmas. Although, even in the weeks before and after, increased tonnages are visible at both the company’s recycling and compost facilities.
Same thing in Southern California: The weeks  after Christmas and New Year’s Eve are among the busiest of the year, said Riel Johnson, vice president of resource recovery with Athens Services. There are also annual spikes around Labor Day, Memorial Day and the Fourth of July.
But while there is often an increase in the amount of material crews pick up, there is also a shift in its composition around the holidays.
That includes more aluminum and more food waste than normal, largely from holiday gatherings. And then there is the cardboard — or what Johnson refers to as “the Amazon effect.”
Mountains of the material are constantly moving through the facility, where it gets sorted and packed into massive bales weighing about 1,400 pounds. Johnson pointed to Amazon Prime logos peppered throughout one of the bales. “It’s everywhere,” he said.
Most of it can be recycled, but small cardboard boxes used to ship one-off items often fall through cracks or get stuck between pieces of machinery, he said.
California
A new rainstorm was expected to move into Southern California on Friday night as residents in some coastal communities dug out from big waves that damaged homes, closed beaches and left several people injured.
Seasonal rainstormsalso add to the difficulties experienced by waste haulers and recyclers. Wet wrapping paper and cardboard can be harder for crews to pick up and can jam machinery, requiring equipment to be cleaned more frequently in order to keep things running smoothly.
“Please keep your bins closed,” Johnson said.
Other problematic items include Christmas lights, which can easily wrap around rotating machinery, and batteries, which can cause fires — a major fear in a warehouse full of paper and plastic. Kid’s toys, remote controls and Christmas cards are all hidden sources of batteries and should be disposed of with care, Johnson said.
(If you’re unsure about an item, you can use Athens’ onlinesearch guideto look up the best means of disposal.)
And while it may be tempting to toss wrapping paper into your blue bin, many types of wrapping paper aren’t recyclable — especially those coated with plastic and metallics, said Brian Hunter, assistant general manager with Athens Services’ Puente Hills location.
“I love wrapping gifts, but a lot of it has glitter and other things that end up being considered contaminants,” he said, noting that many fiber buyers and paper manufacturers won’t accept the material. Consumers wishing for more eco-friendly products can look for plain paper or sustainable alternatives such as fabric and reusable bags.
The good news is that Christmas trees can generally be recycled so long as they’re placed in green bins and cleared of any lights and ornaments. Hunter said the trees are typically taken to organics facilities to be broken down into chips and “green waste” for reuse.
He encouraged people to “do their best to place the items in the proper container, because obviously it helps out the facility that it’s going to, and also it helps by keeping the people who work here safe as well.”
California
The Los Angeles Fire Department urges residents to remove and recycle natural Christmas trees, warning that dry needles can turn a small fire into an inferno in less than 7 seconds.
Cheryl Auger, who runs My Zero Waste store in Pasadena — a shop designed to enable consumers to buy products without plastic packaging — suggests we all take a page from Scroogenomics — a book and philosophy written by Joel Waldfogel, an economist at the University of Minnesota’s Carlson School of Management — which touts reducing, or stopping, the over-consumptive nature of Christmas gifts, food and waste.
“I tell people I don’t want presents,” said Auger, who claims to have only received three this season — which she said is still too many. Especially the electronic fly swatter, encased in plastic. “I’m the kind of person who, if I see a fly, I’ll kindly shoo it out the window.”
She said it’s hard for people to abstain from gift-giving and receiving. It’s so ingrained in our culture; the sense of obligation so strong. But if people really thought about the impact they were having — whether it’s the gag gift or toy they know will stick around for an hour before it’s trashed; or the packaging, paper and ribbons on a gift that’s just going into the garbage; or the carbon footprint that followed a present’s packaging, transportation and delivery — they might demur, as well. Or at least think twice about it.
She said she knows people at work roll their eyes and maybe think she’s kind of a wet blanket with all of her hand-wringing about plastic waste. But they’re slowly catching on. One co-worker brought in lunch the other day in a paper bag. “Oh my God, I’m so proud because she wouldn’t have done that like even a month ago.”
As for gifts — she knows she won’t be able to stop the consumerism that comes with the holiday season — so, she suggests people wrap presents in items around the house or work that they don’t use or need. For instance, Auger owns a rental property. After the tenants moved out, they left some items behind — including a bag for a blow dryer.
“It was plastic and just going to be tossed,” she said. But, it fit the gift she was wrapping and gave the item a second life.
She said newspaper sleeves, newspaper and packaging paper can also be used for wrapping. She said her newspapers often arrive in green or blue plastic sleeves, which make nice decorative bows for Christmas and  Hanukkah gifts.
And gift cards! Don’t even talk to her about those plastic cards that most people forget to use and end up in landfill.
“Give cash!” she said. “It’ll get used and it makes people happy.”
World & Nation
In Manhattan, you won’t find a tree farm or Home Depot parking lot pop-up; many New Yorkers sidewalk-shop for their Christmas trees, buying from vendors who fill the streets each December.
Reed, the Bay Area waste management spokesman, shared photos of the gargantuan piles of waste sitting in the company’s San Francisco site. He said while these holiday spikes are predictable, they also track economic activity.
“When the economy is good, residents and businesses produce more refuse,” he said.
Like the others, he urged consumers and holiday revelers to reduce, reuse and pay attention to the materials they are buying. Can they be reused? Recycled? Composted? Or are you purchasing an item, wrapping, bag or bow that will be used once, then sent off to a landfill where it will sit, undisturbed, for the next several  millenniums?
He urged people to use canvas or other reusable materials to bag their groceries, carry metal water bottles to avoid plastic bottles, and bring  refillable coffee mugs to their favorite coffee shops. Like Auger, he said such items make great gifts, too.
He also suggested people try to get to their local farmers markets, where “produce is presented on tables, not plastic.”
Reed quoted studies that estimate 9 million to 11 million tons of plastic enter our oceans each year, and that plastic in the environment will double by 2030 and nearly triple by 2040. His company urges people to opt for no-packaging alternatives when shopping and to “favor non-plastic options” when packaging is necessary.
“Here’s the bottom line on plastic,” he said. “If we don’t buy it, they won’t make it.”
Johnson, of Athens, noted that not all neighborhoods are created equal when it comes to recycling, and that demographics can make a difference. Wealthy L.A. neighborhoods often fail to put the correct items into the correct bins, he said, while residents of multi-family housing tend to run out of bin space.
“There is always room for improvement, but in general, L.A. does a good job,” he said. “I think Californians — and Angelenos — want to do the right thing.”

Glitter has a microplastics problem. One company says it has the solution,https://www.latimes.com/business/story/2023-12-31/glitter-has-a-microplastics-problem-one-company-says-it-has-the-solution,2023-12-31,"A bit of glitter is like a bottle of champagne on New Year’s Eve: It’s all fun and games until the next morning. Traditional glitter is amicroplastic, which means most of it ends up in bodies of water after a single use. Earlier this year, the European Unionbanned the sale of loose-plastic glitterentirely, citing the impacts on the environment.
That doesn’t mean the party’s over, at least not if the purveyors of Bioglitter have anything to say about it. Invented by Ronald Britton Ltd., a U.K.-based metal-powder supplier, Bioglitter breaks down naturally in freshwater habitats within four weeks, according to its marketing materials.
“Because of their smaller size, microplastics get into literally everywhere in the environment,” says Paul Anastas, director of the Center for Green Chemistry & Green Engineering at Yale University. “Perhaps most importantly, they’ve been found in living things — from plants to small organisms, large organisms, marine life and, yes, humans.”
The Bioglitter journey began about 12 years ago, when Ronald Britton held a meeting to discuss a cosmetics customer’s complaints about the environmental impacts of plastic glitter. At the time, it was the only kind of glitter the company sold.
“Driving back in the car, I thought, We need to replace this with something,” says Andrew Thompson, a Bioglitter product manager at Germany’sSigmund Lindner, which bought the brand from Ronald Britton earlier this year. “Speaking to one or two manufacturers at the time, it was evident that nobody really had a good solution to the problem of how to replace the plastic.”
Ronald Britton decided to create its own product. After consulting experts in biodegradability, the company set its sights on glitter that could safely degrade in freshwater — less ambitious than glitter that biodegrades in (more complex) marine environments, but better than a product that only breaks down in industrial composting conditions.
“The chemistry of freshwater in rivers and lakes around the world, it’s very similar. It’s well understood. And the lab test methods that are recreating the conditions of freshwater are very well understood,” says Stephen Cotton, sales manager of glitter at Signmund Lindner. “So we used that as our guide.”
Climate & Environment
“Only you can prevent wildfires” is an outdated message. Here’s a new one.
Traditional glitter is made of a thin sheet of two types of plastics — polyvinyl chloride (PVC) and polyethylene terephthalate (PET). It’s then coated with aluminum for shine and cut into small, hexagonal pieces. The Ronald Britton team decided to replace the plastic with regenerated cellulose, the stuff of plant cell walls.
To make Bioglitter’s cellulose base, the company sources wood pulp from Europe, often from eucalyptus trees. The wood is FSC- or PEFC-certified, a label that indicates forests managed in line with strict sustainability standards. After the wood is transported to Bioglitter’s two factories in Germany, the cellulose molecules are extracted from the pulp and reconstituted into a clear film, which is then coated with a thin layer of aluminum and color.
The ultimate test of Ronald Britton’s creation was the freshwater-certification process, administered by testing and inspection company TUV Austria. The process can take up to 12 months, requires a detailed breakdown of all raw materials, and costs more than $50,000.
“We wanted to differentiate ourselves and really show how our products were the best in the world,” Cotton says. The process took 10 months and concluded in January 2019; Ronald Britton now touts Bioglitter as the only certified freshwater-biodegradable glitter currently on the market. Its first buyers came from the cosmetics industry.
Even with the certification, Bioglitter’s bonafides aren’t perfect. Onestudy in 2021found that both biodegradable and conventional glitter have harmful effects on plant life in freshwater habitats, and that glitter with a cellulose core encourages the growth of invasive species.
“When we’re talking about greenwashing, we’re always thinking, ‘Are you giving an overly positive view of what you’re doing?’” says Wren Montgomery, an associate professor of sustainability at the Ivy Business School at Western University in Canada. “I would think this is giving an overly positive view.”
Even if Bioglitter does degrade, that doesn’t mean we should let it, says Rafael Auras, a professor in packaging sustainability at Michigan State University, since the degradation process adds nonnaturally occurring cellulose to ecosystems.
As microplastics get more scrutiny, demand for Bioglitter is growing. After the cosmetics customers came the environmentally friendly festival scene, then the crafting industry, then clothing. Earlier this year,Guess launched a T-shirt and sweatshirt lineprinted with BioGlitter. Sigmund Lindner’s acquisition of Bioglitter in May was spurred by a desire to “fix the glitter problem,” Cotton says.
The company is still refining Bioglitter to improve its glitter-y effect and its utility. Today the product comes in three different effects. Biosparkle has a traditional metallic finish, while BioHolo has a more holographic effect. Biopure, in addition to an opalescent look, replaces the shimmer-inducing aluminum coating with one made from natural or synthetic mica.

"Dangerous monster waves, rain slam Southern California on Saturday: What you need to know",https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2023-12-30/la-me-rain-waves-forecast,2023-12-30,"Rain and dangerous high surf arebattering Southern California, prompting urgent safety warnings in coastal areas after damaging waves hit earlier this week.
Showers begin hitting Southern California early Saturday morning.
The forecast calls for several hours of rain, including a few hours of intense showers, and cooler temperatures.
The showers moved out by Saturday afternoon.
California
The high surf that pummeled Southern California this week took a breather Friday, but officials warned people to avoid the beach as another round of strong waves is expected this weekend.
Emergency officials are asking people to avoid the beaches and shorelines over the weekend. All beaches and coastal parks in hard-hit Ventura Countywere closed Friday and will remain closed over the New Year’s weekend, including the Ventura Pier, seaside campgrounds and harbor entries, officials said. In Los Angeles County,the Manhattan Beach Pier will also be closed over the weekendand the Hermosa Beach Pier will be closed Saturday because of the high surf.
California
Eight spectators in Ventura were injured after being struck by a massive wave. Officials warn against nearing the ocean during a high surf advisory.
“Our recommendation is not to venture into the water, especially in those areas where the surf is showing heavy activity and large swells,” said Pono Barnes, spokesperson for the Los Angeles County Fire Department’s Lifeguard Division. “It’s not the best day to start your surfing journey or testing your skills in the water if you’re not 100% confident.”
For those near the water, officials said to pay close attention.
“Take caution and heed the direction of local authorities and lifeguards,” the National Weather Service said. “Never ever turn your back to the water as damaging and life-threatening sneaker waves are likely to occur.”
The forecast calls for 15- to 20-foot waves, including sets of up to 25-foot waves, along the Central Coast. Ventura County beaches are expected to receive 10- to 15-foot waves, with 20-foot sets. Santa Barbara County beaches along the South Coast will be hit with 7- to 12-foot waves and in some areas 15- to 20-foot sets along west-facing beaches near Point Conception, according to forecasts.
The NWS said local beaches have an “extreme” risk of flooding and high waves Saturday. Those are the same conditions that hit Ventura County on Thursday,causing damage to homesand leaving some people injured.
The wave that crashed into Ventura County is known as a “sneaker wave,” officials said.
California
Unsuspecting sneaker waves did and could continue to hit the California coastline during the coastal flood and surf warnings. What to know about sneaker waves.
The powerful waves are created by larger than average swells that can suddenly and without warning surge much farther inland than expected, breaking over rocks and lifting logs or driftwood onto the beach with deadly force, according to the National Weather Service. Some sneaker waves can surge more than 150 feet up the beach, catching people off guard, causing them to lose their footing and even sweeping them back into the ocean, according to officials.
Forecasts show a slight chance of rain on New Year’s Eve in the Pasadena area and lingering through New Year’s Day. The forecast shows a 20% to 30% chance for light rain.

Maui’s economy needs tourists. Can they visit without compounding wildfire trauma?,https://www.latimes.com/world-nation/story/2023-12-29/mauis-economy-needs-tourists-can-they-visit-without-compounding-wildfire-trauma,2023-12-29,"LAHAINA, Hawaii —The restaurant where Katie Austin was a server burned in the wildfire that devastated Hawaii’s historic town ofLahainathis summer.
Two months later, as travelers began totrickle backto nearbybeach resorts, she went to work at a different eatery. But she soon quit, worn down by constant questions from diners: Was she affected by the fire? Did she know anyone who died?
“You’re at work for eight hours and every 15 minutes you have a new stranger ask you about the most traumatic day of your life,” Austin said. “It was soul-sucking.”
Hollywood Inc.
Rev. William Barber Jr., former president of the NAACP North Carolina chapter, says he was removed from an AMC theater for bringing a chair for his disability.
Hawaii’s governor and mayor invited tourists back to the west side of Maui months after the Aug. 8 fire killed at least 100 people and destroyed more than 2,000 buildings. They wanted the economic boost tourists would bring, particularly heading into the year-end holidays.
But some residents are struggling with the return of an industry requiring workers to be attentive and hospitable even though they are trying to care for themselves after losing their loved ones, friends, homes and community.
Elsewhere on Maui,  like the ritzy resorts in Wailea, 30 miles  south of Lahaina — where the first season of the HBO hit “The White Lotus” was filmed — are eagerly welcoming travelers and their dollars.
Things are more complicated in west Maui. Lahaina is still a mess of charred rubble. Efforts to clean up toxic debris are painstakingly slow. It’s off-limits to everyone except residents.
Tensions are peaking over the lack of long-term, affordable housing for wildfire evacuees, many of whom work in tourism. Dozens have been camping out in protest around the clock on a popular tourist beach at Kaanapali, a few miles north of Lahaina. Last week, hundreds marched between two large hotels waving signs reading, “We need housing now!” and “Short-term rentals gotta go!”
Hotels at Kaanapali are still housing about 6,000 fire evacuees unable to find long-term shelter in Maui’s tight and expensive housing market. But some have started to bring back tourists, and owners of timeshare condos have returned. At a shopping mall, visitors stroll past shops and dine at at open-air oceanfront restaurants.
Austin took a job at a restaurant in Kaanapali after the fire, but quit after five weeks. It was a strain to serve mai tais to people staying in a hotel or vacation rental while her friends were leaving the island because they lacked housing, she said.
Servers and many others in the tourism industry often work for tips, which puts them in a difficult position when a customer prods them with questions they don’t want to answer. Even after Austin’s restaurant posted a sign asking customers to respect employees’ privacy, the queries continued.
“I started telling people, ‘Unless you’re a therapist, I don’t want to talk to you about it,’ ” she said.
Austin now plans to work for a nonprofit organization that advocates for housing.
Erin Kelley didn’t lose her home or workplace but has been laid off as a bartender at Sheraton Maui Resort since the fire. The hotel reopened to visitors in late December, but she doesn’t expect to get called back to work until business picks up.
She has mixed feelings. Workers should have a place to live before tourists are welcome in west Maui, she said, but residents are so dependent on the industry that many will remain jobless without those same visitors.
“I’m really sad for friends and empathetic towards their situation,” she said. “But we also need to make money,”
When she does return to work, Kelley said she won’t want to “talk about anything that happened for the past few months.”
More travel destinations will likely have to navigate these dilemmas as climate change increases the frequency and intensity of natural disasters.
There is no manual for doing so, said Chekitan Dev, a tourism professor at Cornell University. Handling disasters — natural and man-made — will have to be part of their business planning.
Andreas Neef, a development professor and tourism researcher at the University of Auckland in New Zealand, suggested one solution might be to promote organized “voluntourism.” Instead of sunbathing, tourists could visit part of west Maui that didn’t burn and enlist in an effort to help the community.
“Bringing tourists for relaxation back is just at this time a little bit unrealistic,” Neef said. “I couldn’t imagine relaxing in a place where you still feel the trauma that has affected the place overall.”
Many travelers have been canceling holiday trips to Maui out of respect, said Lisa Paulson, the executive director of the Maui Hotel and Lodging Assn. Visitation is down about 20% from December  2022, according tostate data.
Cancellations are affecting hotels all over the island, not just in west Maui.
Paulson attributes some of this to confusing messages in national and social media about whether visitors should come. Many people don’t understand the island’s geography or that there are places people can visit outside west Maui, she said.
One way visitors can help is to remember they’re traveling to a place that recently experienced significant trauma, said Amory Mowrey, the executive director of Maui Recovery, a mental health and substance abuse residential treatment center.
“Am I being driven by compassion and empathy or am I just here to take, take, take?” he said.
That’s the approach honeymooners Jordan and Carter Prechel of Phoenix adopted. They kept their reservations in Kihei, about 25 miles  south of Lahaina, vowing to be respectful and to support local businesses.
“Don’t bombard them with questions,” Jordan said recently while eating an afternoon snack in Kaanapali with her husband. “Be conscious of what they’ve gone through.”

Solar installations are plummeting and California regulators are to blame,https://www.latimes.com/opinion/story/2023-12-28/editorial-solar-installations-are-plummeting-and-california-regulators-are-to-blame,2023-12-28,"It looks like California is going from solar leader to solar loser.
A year after regulators at the state Public Utilities Commission voted togut the successful incentive programthat has helped put more than1.8 million solar systemson homes and businesses, the consequences are becoming distressingly clear.
Preliminary data from the rooftop solar industry showsa steep drop in installationsandwidespread job lossessince April. That’s when the PUC’s changes to the net energy metering program took effect, slashing the compensation new solar customers receive for the excess power they feed into the grid.
The commission sided with utilities, organized labor and consumer advocates who argued that incentives were so generous that solar customers weren’t paying their fair share to maintain the power grid, raising electricity rates for lower-income households and renters without solar arrays.
Biden can bypass Congress to protect an additional 1 million acres in California, including in the desert near Joshua Tree and the San Gabriel Mountains. He should do so without delay.
It’s not a surprise that eviscerating the financial incentives for consumers to invest in solar power would cause sales to plummet. But it’s still incredibly disappointing to see the outcome of state regulators’ wrecking-ball approach play out so predictably.
The analysisby the California Solar & Storage Assn. found that sales of rooftop systems in the state have dropped between 77% and 85% since April. That’s backed up by data from Southern California Edison and Pacific Gas & Electric showing that customers’ applications to connect their solar systems to the grid dropped between 66% and 83% in the months since incentives were reduced, compared with  the same time period in 2022.
California regulators revise plan to slash incentives for rooftop solar. It’s not as drastic as before, but that doesn’t make it a reasonable compromise.
The industry group forecasts that 17,000 jobs — one-fifth of all solar jobs in California — could be lost by the end of 2023 as the reduction in incentives comes on top of high interest rates and inflation. That’s a steeper decline than the industry experienced in 2020 when the COVID-19 pandemic brought most solar installations to a halt.
Undermining the rooftop solar market is the opposite of what California should be doing to combat climate change. The world recorded its hottest year in 2023 and is experiencing worsening storms, heat waves and wildfires and other disasters. Yet, state regulators are doubling down.
Last month, the five-member panel of commissioners appointed by Gov. Gavin Newsomvoted to slash solar incentives again, this time making it far less financially viable for apartment buildings, schools, strip malls, farms and small businesses to go solar. These decisions serve the interests of the  state’s three big investor-owned utilities, who want to get solar electricity from large-scale arrays in the desert where it can be generated more cheaply. Organized labor also stands to benefit from the change. As the rooftop market falters, there will be more need for union-built solar projects to help the state meet its renewable energy goals.
Finally, the world agrees to move away from fossil fuels, adopting a historic agreement at the COP28 summit in Dubai. Doing it is another thing.
The gutting of rooftop solar incentives isn’t  hurting only the local regional companies that install residential systems. It’s also dragging down big, publicly traded companieslike Enphase Energythat supply the equipment used in rooftop arrays.
Keeping solar financially viable and affordable for as many Californians as possible to generate renewable energy on their homes, apartments, businesses, schools and churches isn’t too much to ask. It’s an imperative for our planet.
Newsom and his PUC appointees should keep an eye on this alarming decline in solar jobs and installations and, if it continues, intervene. You can’t be a leader in the fight against climate change by crashing the solar market. It’s not too late to reverse course, reestablish strong consumer incentives for solar systems with battery storage and stem the damage to a cornerstone of California’s clean energy future.

Wildfire scorching the Texas Panhandle has grown to the largest in state history,https://www.latimes.com/world-nation/story/2024-02-29/a-wildfire-scorching-the-texas-panhandle-has-grown-to-the-largest-in-state-history,2024-02-29,"STINNETT, Texas —A dusting of snow covered a desolate landscape of scorched prairie, dead cattle and burned-out homes in the Texas Panhandle on Thursday, giving firefighters brief relief in their desperate efforts to corral a blaze that has grown into the largest in state history.
The Smokehouse Creek fire grew to nearly 1,700 square miles. It merged with another fire and is just 3% contained, according to the Texas A&M Forest Service.
Gray skies loomed over huge scars of blackened earth ina rural areadotted with scrub brush, ranchland, rocky canyons and oil rigs. In Stinnett, a town of about 1,600, someone propped up an American flag outside a destroyed home.
Dylan Phillips, 24, said he hardly recognized his Stinnett neighborhood, which was littered with melted street signs and the charred frames of cars and trucks. His family’s home survived, but at least half a dozen others were smoking rubble.
World & Nation
A fast-moving wildfire burning through the Texas Panhandle has grown into the second-largest blaze in the state’s history.
“It was brutal,” Phillips said. “The streetlights were out. It was nothing but embers and flames.”
The Smokehouse Creek fire’sexplosive growthslowed Thursday as snow fell, winds ebbed and temperatures dipped, but it was still untamed and threatening. It is the largest of several major fires burning in therural Panhandle section of the state. It has also crossed into Oklahoma.
Firefighter Lee Jones was helping douse the smoldering wreckage of homes in Stinnett to keep them from reigniting when temperatures and winds increase Friday and into the weekend.
“The snow helps,” said Jones, who was among a dozen firefighters called in from Lubbock to help. “We’re just hitting all the hot spots around town, the houses that have already burned.”
Authorities have not said what ignited the fires, but strong winds, dry grass andunseasonably warm temperaturesfed the blazes.
World & Nation
Texas fire crews hope to make progress Saturday against a massive complex of wildfires that have killed one person and burned at least 50 homes.
“The rain and the snow is beneficial right now; we’re using it to our advantage,” Texas A&M Forest Service spokesman Juan Rodriguez said of the Smokehouse Creek fire. “When the fire isn’t blowing up and moving very fast, firefighters are able to actually catch up and get to those parts of the fire.”
Authorities said 1,640 square miles of the fire were on the Texas side of the border. Previously, the largest fire in recorded state history was the East Amarillo Complex fire in 2006, which burned about 1,400 square miles and resulted in 13 deaths.
An 83-year-old woman was the only confirmed death so far this week. But with flames still menacing a wide area, authorities had yet to conduct a thorough search for victims or tally the numerous homes and other structures damaged or destroyed.
Gov. Greg Abbott has issued a disaster declaration for 60 counties and planned to visit the Panhandle on Friday.
Nim Kidd, chief of the Texas Division of Emergency Management, said the weekend forecast and “sheer size and scope” of the blaze are the biggest challenges for firefighters.

“I don’t want the community there to feel a false sense of security that all these fires will not grow anymore,” Kidd said. “This is still a very dynamic situation.”
Jeremiah Kaslon, 39, a Stinnett resident who saw neighbors’ homes destroyed by flames that stopped just on the edge of his property, seemed prepared for what the changing forecast might bring.
“Around here, the weather, we get all four seasons in a week,” Kalson said. “It can be hot, hot and windy, and it will be snowing the next day. It’s just that time of year.”
The woman who died was identified by family members as Joyce Blankenship, a former substitute teacher. Her grandson, Lee Quesada, said he had posted in a community forum asking if anyone could try to locate her. Quesada said deputies told his uncle Wednesday that they had found Blankenship’s remains in her burned home.
Encroaching flames caused the main facility thatdisassembles America’s nuclear arsenalto pause operations Tuesday night, but it was open for normal work by Wednesday.
World & Nation
At least 156 structures were destroyed in the Texas Panhandle and 2,100 residents were evacuated after a wildfire burned up to two square miles northeast of Amarillo, fire officials said Monday.
The small town of Fritch, north of Amarillo, lost hundreds of homes in a 2014 fire and lost an estimated 40-50 homes again this week, Mayor Tom Ray said.
Texas Agriculture Commissioner Sid Miller estimated the number of cattle killed in the fires to be in the thousands, with more likely to come.
“There’ll be cattle that we’ll have to euthanize,” Miller said. “They’ll have burned hooves, burned udders.”
Miller said individual ranchers could suffer devastating losses, but predicted the overall impact on the Texas cattle industry would be minimal. Cattle raised in the Panhandle are largely “range cattle,” not feeder cattle that are sold to feed lots and eventually make their way to the kitchen table for consumption, he said.
Miller said any impact on the price of beef for consumers would be minimal, and at least a year away from being felt.
Vertuno reported from Austin. Associated Press reporters Ty O’Neil in Stinnett, Jamie Stengle in Dallas and Ken Miller in Oklahoma City contributed to this report.

"High avalanche danger, winds topping 100 mph as blizzard slams Tahoe, Mammoth, Sierra Nevada",https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2024-02-29/treacherous-blizzard-to-hit-tahoe-mammoth-gusts-of-110-mph-are-possible-do-not-travel-forecasters-say,2024-03-02,"A treacherous, life-threatening blizzard was strengthening over California’s mightiest mountain range Friday, already bringing 100- to 110-mph gusts at the higher elevations, with conditions expected to deteriorate dramatically by the evening.
A gust of 145 mph was recorded Thursday night at Palisades Tahoe at an elevation of 8,700 feet above sea level.
Officials Friday warned of high avalanche danger through Sunday in the Central Sierra slopes and the Lake Tahoe area.
Up to 12 feet of snow could fall on the highest peaks of the Sierra Nevada  through Sunday, theNational Weather Service office in Sacramentosaid. Other areas with an elevation of 5,000 feet above sea level could get 5 to 10 feet of snow.
Yosemite National Park said it had closed through at least noon Sunday because of the storm. “Visitors currently in the park should leave as soon as possible, and no later than noon” on Friday, the parksaid. Several feet of snow is expected at Yosemite.
“Travel should be restricted to emergencies only,” the weather service office in Hanford said.
The storm is particularly strong and cold, as it’s moving in from the Pacific Northwest, and “it’s a really deep area of low pressure. It has a lot of cold air ingested into it. And the track and the setup of the system really enhances the upslope flow, or the training of precipitation, over the Sierra,” said Jeffery Wood, meteorologist with the weather service’s Sacramento office. “So as that cold air and moisture is moving up the mountains, it allows for several hours of continuous snowfall to fall.”
It’s possible this storm could result in one of thetop 10 snowiest daysin the central Sierra since 1970, Wood said.
There will be “whiteout conditions with near zero-visibility at times due to blowing snow,” the weather service office in Renowarnedof the strongest Sierra storm of this winter. “Do not travel. If you must travel, have a winter survival kit with you. If you get stranded, stay in your vehicle.”


The main route between Southern California and Mammoth Mountain, Highway 395, could see 1 to 3 feet of snow, with gusts of up to 75 mph in these lower-elevation areas. On Thursday afternoon, the Mammoth area was already seeing gusts of 60 mph.

The highest elevation of the main roads to Lake Tahoe from the San Francisco Bay Area — Interstate 80 and Highway 50 — could see upward of 8 to 10 feet of snow. Interstate 5 in Siskiyou County, near the Oregon border, could see more than 1 foot of snow.
A post office in Leggett — an unincorporated  commmunity in Mendocino County that sits next to the Smith Redwoods State Natural Reserve — caught fire Friday after a nearby tree was struck by lightning, according to local residents and emergency scanner reports.
Resident Lizbeth Rangel and her boyfriend Josh Trimble reported the fire at about 5:30 p.m., after they pulled up to a local market connected to the post office to get something to drink.
“There has been a lot of lightning hitting today,” Rangel said when reached by phone. “I’ve lived here for the last eight years and I’ve never seen this much. It’s the worst lightning strikes ever.”
In Lake Tahoe, Manuel Jimenez Jr. and his son, Manuel Jimenez III, spent Thursday morning getting their tow trucks ready for what was sure to be a busy weekend on the roads. The two own two local towing companies — Lake Tahoe Towing and South Lake Tahoe Towing — and storms such as this mean long workdays ahead.
“This is when the big boys step up,” said the older Jimenez.
Climate & Environment
California’s third snow survey of the season measured statewide snowpack at 80% of normal for the date, and much more snow is on the way.
The father and son have been working in the area for seven years, and, while many will try to hunker indoors until the storm passes, this is one of the busiest times for their business.
The two also document their exploits online, posting videos of how they pull stranded drivers back to safety for their thousands offollowers on Instagram.
Before the storm arrived, they checked the equipment on their trucks, loaded their snow blowers, packed an extra pair of chains and inspected them to make sure none of them snap in the cold snow.
They know people have been warned not to travel, but with seven years of experience towing stranded cars, they know the cars will still come.
“When they don’t heed the warnings, and people are saying this is going to be a big one, we end up with six, seven miles of car jams within town,” Jimenez Jr. said. “They can’t even leave the basin.”
During bad storms, the two companies will get two calls a minute from drivers asking for help, he said. Storms such as this can create so much demand that they stay working 24 hours straight.
Climate & Environment
When it comes to stormwater capture, California stands out for “untapped potential,” according to the Pacific Institute.
Many of the calls are from drivers who have jumped off main highways and followed navigation apps that lead them through local paths and streets away from traffic, he said. But while the apps navigate drivers away from gridlock, many of them don’t take into consideration the fact that local roads might be too steep, unplowed or not passable to drivers unaccustomed to driving in the snow.
“I always tell people, don’t follow your Google maps or other apps, ever,” he said. “Know your route and stick to that route.”
The father and son know the work can be dangerous, but it’s been slow for most of the year, and strong storms are what will also help keep their businesses going.
Just in case, they and their drivers will pack extra food, blankets and clothes in the two trucks for the long, cold days ahead, and in case they themselves become stranded. During one of the last strong storms, Jimenez Jr. said, one of his drivers was stranded for about 14 hours before another tow truck was able to get to him.
But after a slow year for their business, they welcome the work.
“This is a feast-or-famine type of situation,” Jimenez Jr. said. “When it’s time to feast, we’re out there to make money.”
Ski resorts were thrilled with the impending snowfall but joined officials in warning that mountain roads could be closed during the worst of the storm. Ski resorts could face partial or full closures during the peak of the blizzard on Friday and Saturday.
“We do expect that Sunday will be a day of patience as we dig out,” Palisades Tahoesaidon social media.
“It’s going to DUMP,” Mammoth Mountainsaidon social media. “It’s looking like we have a lot of digging to look forward to the next few days.”
“During these major storms expect DEEP snow, always ski and ride with a buddy, keep your buddy in sight and avoid the base of trees. Be aware ofSnow Immersion Suffocation (SIS) dangers,” Mammoth Mountain said, referring to the risk when skiers leave groomed trails and fall into an area of deep, unconsolidated snow.
“If wind and snow were not enough, it will be much colder,” theNational Weather Service office in Reno said. “Wind chills will drop below zero in the Sierra high country. This really does add a serious life-threatening element to this storm, and why you want to avoid getting stuck!”
The storm was slated to roll in hours after officials with the California Department of Water Resources conducted their third snow survey of the season at Phillips Station near South Lake Tahoe. The survey showed that statewide snowpack has improved considerably since the start of the year, when experts expressed concern about a potential “snow drought” due to a late start to the rainy season and a large number of warm storms that fell as rain instead of snow.
Statewide snowpack on Thursday measured 80% of average for the date, and 70% of average for April 1, the date when it is typically at its peak. But officials were optimistic that the incoming blizzard would offer a significant boost.
“The good news is that we have a big storm starting here through the weekend, and it will be a cold one,” said Andy Reising, water resources engineer in the department’s snow survey and supply forecasting unit. Reising said it should be a good snow producer, with heaps of powder expected at both low and high elevations.
“We’re quite pleased to announce that that’s coming, and it will help get us toward average, maybe even above average, for the state,” he said.

Daniel Swain, a UCLA climate scientist, said he strongly encouraged people not to head up to the mountains for a powder weekend, given that road travel will be dangerous. The California Highway Patrol office in Truckee has alreadywarnedabout expected long delays and road closures.
Additionally, Swain said, ski resorts will probably need to halt chairlifts during strong winds.
The strong storm may come as a bit of shock to the Lake Tahoe area, “given how anemic this year’s snow season has been thus far at lake level,” Swainwrote in a blog post. “But this one looks like the real deal. ... This is virtually guaranteed to be a dangerous and disruptive snowstorm.”
Swain added in abriefing Thursdaythe storm could set top-five daily or two-day snow accumulation records in some locations. Snowfall rates of 2 inches per hour — or even up to 5 inches per hour — are possible for multiple hours on end, he said.
“The big story is going to be the Sierra Nevada and some of the other higher mountains in Northern California and in Central California … where there will be legitimate blizzard conditions developing later” Thursday night into Friday, Swain said during thebriefing.
He noted the storm is somewhat unusual for its frigid temperatures and wet conditions.
“We rarely get air masses this cold that are also this moist and associated with this much storm activity,” Swain said. “We definitely get colder air masses than this one in California, but they’re usually much drier than this one.”
The National Weather Service issued a blizzard warning over a wide swath of the Sierra Nevada, from Lassen Volcanic National Park in Shasta County to Kings Canyon National Park in Fresno County. The blizzard warning began on Thursday and lasts through Sunday; the worst of the storm was expected between Friday afternoon through the midday of Saturday.
“For Sierra locations, don’t get caught up in the ‘worst conditions’ time frame. It is going to be really bad throughout the entire event!” the weather service office in Reno warned. “Winds ... will remain strong enough to produce near-zero visibility in the Sierra and the foothills.”
The weather service office in Eureka warned of snow on all roads 1,000 feet above sea level between Thursday through Saturday.
Highway 101 at Ridgewood Summit in Mendocino County could get half a foot of snow. And Highway 101 at Prairie Creek Summit in Humboldt County could get 1 to 1.5 feet.
Hail could strike coastal roads in Humboldt and Del Norte counties on Friday and Saturday, and linger, forecasters said. “Ease off the gas if you suddenly find yourself on a hail-covered roadway,” the weather service said. “Do not slam on the brakes. Avoid overcorrecting.”

There’s a chance of up to 1 inch of snow on the Grapevine section of Interstate 5, which connects Los Angeles County with the Central Valley through the Tejon Pass. Snow is also possible on Highway 58 over the Tehachapi Pass, which connects Bakersfield with the Mojave Desert.
In the mountains of San Diego, Riverside and San Bernardino counties, there could be 3 to 7 inches of snow at areas 7,000 feet above sea level, and 1 to 3 inches at areas between 6,000 to 7,000 feet.
In Los Angeles County, areas at 7,000 feet above sea level could see 5 to 10 inches of snow, and areas 4,000 above sea level could see at least 1 inch.
There’s a slight chance of rain in L.A., Orange and Ventura counties during the day Friday, a probability that grows on Friday night. Rain is expected during the day Saturday in those coastal counties as well as the Inland Empire.
From Friday through Sunday, downtown L.A. is expected to get 0.41 inches of rain; Long Beach, 0.34 inches; Redondo Beach, 0.29 inches; Santa Clarita, 0.51 inches; Pomona, 0.58 inches; Oxnard, 0.34 inches; and Santa Barbara, 0.48 inches.
Anaheim could get up to half an inch of rain; Irvine, San Clemente and Riverside, up to 0.4 inches; Ontario, up to 0.7 inches; San Bernardino, up to 1 inch; and San Diego, up to 0.2 inches.
The San Francisco Bay Area is forecast to see rain and winds Thursday through Saturday, with 0.5 to 2 inches of precipitation expected in the cities. Snow is possible on the Bay Area’s highest peaks.
Strong gusts from 35 to 55 mph are a concern in the section of the Sacramento Valley that is north of Marysville, the county seat of Yuba County.

Wildfire grows into 2nd-largest blaze in Texas history as flames menace multiple small towns,https://www.latimes.com/world-nation/story/2024-02-28/wildfire-grows-into-2nd-largest-blaze-in-texas-history-as-flames-menace-multiple-small-towns,2024-02-28,"DALLAS —A fast-moving wildfire burning through the Texas Panhandle grew into the second-largest blaze in state history Wednesday, forcing evacuations and triggering power outages as firefighters struggled to contain the widening flames.
The sprawling blaze was part of a cluster of fires that burned out of control and threatened rural towns, where local officials shut down roads and urged residents to leave their homes. The largest of the fires — which grew to nearly 800 square miles  — jumped into parts of neighboring Oklahoma and was completely uncontained as dawn broke, according to the Texas A&M Forest Service.
Officials were assessing the damage Wednesday and warned it could be extensive. Hemphill County Emergency Management Coordinator Bill Kendall described the charred terrain “like a moonscape. ... It’s just all gone.”
Kendall said about 40 homes were burned around the perimeter of the town of Canadian, but no buildings were lost inside the community.
“We started getting those losses in the dark, so we didn’t really know what we had until this morning, until we could see,” he said.
The town of Fritch, with a population of less than 2,000, lost hundreds of homes in a 2014 fire and appeared to be hit hard again.
The people in that area are probably not “prepared for what they’re going to see if they pull into town,” Hutchinson County Emergency Management spokesperson Deidra Thomas said in a social media livestream. She compared the damage to a tornado.
World & Nation
Texas fire crews hope to make progress Saturday against a massive complex of wildfires that have killed one person and burned at least 50 homes.
The town remained unsafe for people to return to, she said.
Authorities have not said what ignited the fires, but strong winds, dry grass and unseasonably warm temperatures fed the blazes. Near Borger, a community of about 13,000 people, emergency officials at one point late Tuesday answered questions from panicked residents during a Facebook livestream and told them to get ready to leave if they had not already.
“It was like a ring of fire around Borger. There was no way out. ... All four main roads were closed,” said Adrianna Hill, 28, whose home was within about a mile of the fire. She said a northern wind that blew the fire in the opposite direction “saved our butts.”
Republican Gov. Greg Abbott issued a disaster declaration for 60 counties. The encroaching flames caused the main facility that disassembles America’s nuclear arsenal to pause operations Tuesday night, but it was open for normal work on Wednesday.
The blazes tore through sparsely populated counties on the vast, high plains that are punctuated by cattle ranches and oil rigs. The main fire, known as the Smoke House Creek fire, had grown to more than half the size of the state of Rhode Island. It is five times larger than on Monday, when it began.
The weather forecast provided some hope for firefighters — cooler temperatures, less wind and possibly rain on Thursday. But for now, the situation was dire in some areas.
World & Nation
Fire crews in Texas make progress against a massive complex of wildfires that has killed a sheriff’s deputy and burned at least 50 homes.
Sustained winds of up to 45 mph,  with gusts of up to 70 mph,  caused the fires that were spreading east to turn south, threatening new areas, forecasters said. But winds calmed down after a cold front came through Tuesday evening, said Peter Vanden Bosch, a meteorologist at the National Weather Service in Amarillo, Texas.
“Fortunately, the winds have weakened quite significantly,” Vanden Bosch said Wednesday. Breezy conditions were expected again Friday, and critical fire weather could return by the weekend, he said.
As the evacuation orders mounted Tuesday, county and city officials implored residents to turn on emergency alert services on their cellphones and to be ready to evacuate immediately.
An unknown number of homes and other structures in the county were damaged or destroyed, local emergency officials said.
The Pantex plant, northeast of Amarillo, evacuated nonessential staff Tuesday night out of an “abundance of caution,” said Laef Pendergraft, a spokesperson for National Nuclear Security Administration’s production office at Pantex. Firefighters remained in case of an emergency.
The plant has long been the main U.S. site for both assembling and disassembling atomic bombs. It completed its last new bomb in 1991 and has dismantled thousands since.
Pantex tweeted early Wednesday that the facility “is open for normal day shift operations” and that all personnel were to report for duty according to their assigned schedule.

At least 156 structures were destroyed in the Texas Panhandle and 2,100 residents were evacuated after a wildfire burned up to two square miles northeast of Amarillo, fire officials said Monday.
As the fires raged Tuesday, evacuations were ordered in several towns in a swath northeast of Amarillo.
The Smokehouse Creek fire spread from Texas into neighboring Roger Mills County in western Oklahoma, where officials encouraged people in the Durham area to flee. Officials did not know yet how large the fire was in Oklahoma. The Roger Mills County emergency management director did not immediately return phone calls for comment.
An unrelated fire in Ellis County, Oklahoma, on the Oklahoma-Texas state line, led Tuesday to the evacuations of the towns of Shattuck and Gage. The evacuation order was lifted hours later, according to county Emergency Management Director Riley Latta. The fire had unknown origins and burned an estimated 47 square miles, according to the Oklahoma Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry.
On Tuesday evening, the fires were 20 to 25 miles  from Amarillo, and wind was blowing smoke into the city, which could affect people with respiratory issues, National Weather Service officials said.
The weather service issued red-flag warnings and fire-danger alerts for several other states through the midsection of the country, as winds of over 40 mph  combined with warm temperatures, low humidity and dry winter vegetation to make conditions ripe for wildfires.
In central Nebraska, a mower sparked a prairie fire that burned a huge swath of grassland roughly the size of Omaha, the state’s largest city,  state officials said Tuesday.

Southern California Edison to pay $80 million over deadly 2017 Thomas fire,https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2024-02-26/southern-california-edison-agrees-to-pay-80-million-to-resolve-claims-tied-to-deadly-2017-thomas-fire,2024-02-26,"Southern California Edison has agreed to pay $80 million to cover costs and damages from the 2017 Thomas fire, a massive blaze in Ventura and Santa Barbara counties that killed two people and later triggered amassive mudflowthat resulted in23 deaths.
The Thomas fire, which scorched more than 280,000 acres and destroyed more than 1,000 structures, ignited on Dec. 4, 2017, after high winds caused two Southern California Edison power lines to slap together,fire officials found.
Combined with another blaze sparked by the company’s equipment, it became the eighth-largest wildfire in state history, according to the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection.
The utility agreed, in a settlement finalized Friday afternoon, to pay the federal government to resolve claims on behalf of the U.S. Forest Service, the Justice Department announced Monday. Edison did so without admitting wrongdoing or fault.
In a news release, the Justice Department called it “the largest wildfire cost recovery settlement by the United States in the Central District of California.”
“This record settlement provides significant compensation to taxpayers for the extensive costs of fighting the Thomas fire and for the widespread damage to public lands,” First Assistant U.S. Atty. Joseph T. McNally said.
Gabriela Ornelas, a spokesperson with Edison, called the settlement “a reasonable resolution.”
“We continue to protect our communities from the risk of wildfire with grid hardening, situational awareness and enhanced operational practices,” she said.
The Thomas fire began in two locations on that December evening, according to fire officials. The first ignition point was in Anlauf Canyon and the second was at the top of Koenigstein Road in Ventura County. The two fires joined together and formed the Thomas fire.
In 2020, the federal government filed a lawsuit on behalf of the Forest Service against Edison to recover costs from fighting the fire and for the extensive damage it caused to Los Padres National Forest, the U.S. attorney’s office said in its news release.
The Justice Department alleged that Edison owned, maintained and operated the power lines that caused both ignitions. In Anlauf Canyon, the government alleged that Edison power lines made contact with one another and ignited dry vegetation below. On Koenigstein Road, the federal litigation alleged that an Edison power pole transformer failed and caused an energized power line to fall to the ground, also igniting dry vegetation.
Edisonpreviously acknowledgedthat its equipment probably started a fire off Koenigstein Road in Santa Paula, but its own investigators concluded that the company was probably not responsible for the second, larger blaze that began in Anlauf Canyon.
California
Investigators have determined that Southern California Edison power lines ignited the 2017 Thomas fire, a massive blaze in Ventura and Santa Barbara counties that killed two people and later gave rise to a massive mudflow that resulted in at least 21 deaths.
The utility agreed to pay the $80-million settlement within 60 days of the effective date of the agreement, according to the U.S. attorney’s office.
Utility-sparked wildfires in recent years have devastated vast swaths of the state, killing people and destroying small towns in their wake.
The Camp fire of 2018, which investigators said was caused by a failed Pacific Gas & Electric transmission line in the Sierra Nevada foothills, becamethe deadliest wildfire in California history, destroying the town of Paradise and killing 85 people.
Edison has paid out millions in recent years tied to wildfires. In 2021, the utility agreed to pay $550 million in fines to the California Public Utilities Commission safety and enforcement division for its role in five wildfires.
The agreement included fines and penalties relating to the Thomas, Woolsey, Rye, Meyers and Liberty fires, which collectively burned more than 380,000 acres and destroyed thousands of homes.
Investigators with the commission’s Safety and Enforcement Division determined that Southern California Edison violated state safety regulations, which led to the ignition of the blazes, they said.

Federal judge in Nevada hands wild-horse advocates rare victory on mustang management plans,https://www.latimes.com/world-nation/story/2024-03-29/us-judge-in-nevada-hands-wild-horse-advocates-rare-victory-in-ruling-on-mustang-management-plans,2024-03-30,"RENO —In a rare legal victory for wild horse advocates, a judge has ruled U.S. land managers failed to adopt a legal herd management plan or conduct the necessary environmental review before 31 mustangs died during the roundup of more than 2,000 horses in Nevada last summer.
U.S. District Judge Miranda Du in Reno ordered the Bureau of Land Management to complete a formal herd management plan for the Pancake complex in eastern Nevada by March 24, 2025. She also ordered the agency to reopen an environmental assessment to include the potential impact of roundups on wildfire risks.
Du specifically rejected the argument the agency has made for years that its broader resource management plans combined with individual roundup plans for overpopulated herds satisfies the requirement that it adopt a formal herd management area plan, known as HMAP, for the long-term health of the herds and the rangeland in a particular area or herd complex.
“The court finds that BLM must be compelled to prepare a herd management area plan (HMAP),” Du wrote in the 29-page ruling issued Thursday.
Horse advocates who cheered the ruling said that while it comes too late for the horses that were captured or killed last summer, it sets a precedent that will help provide more protection for mustangs roaming federal lands in the West.
“This is an amazing day for our beloved wild ones,” said Laura Leigh, founder and president of the lead plaintiff in the case, Nevada-based Wild Horse Education.
“The Wild Free-Roaming Horses and Burros Act is about more than just removal. Today, the court affirmed the intention of that law,” she said Friday.
A spokesman for the Bureau of Land Management said Friday the agency was reviewing the ruling but had no immediate comment.
Last summer, another U.S. judge in Reno refused to grant an injunction sought by horse advocates to halt the roundup that was underway after dozens of horses died during the event.
Judge Larry Hicks concluded in August that the agency had not violated laws protecting the animals from inhumane treatment. But he allowed Wild Horse Education to continue with the lawsuit it first filed in 2022 that alleged the agency was acting illegally because it never implemented the herd management plan that was required since the management area was established in 1986.
Du did not address allegations of inhumane treatment of the animals. She agreed with the agency’s argument that it had the authority to round up horses as soon as it determined the herd was overpopulated. And she rejected horse advocates’ attempt to force the agency to specifically consider cutbacks in livestock grazing or incorporate different procedures to estimate the sizes of herds.
But Du said the bureau could not continue to respond to lawsuits by explaining it was still preparing a formal herd management area plan with no definitive assurance it actually would finish one.
“The duty to prepare an [HMAP] arose as soon as the BLM created the HMAs,” Du wrote. “That duty arose when BLM promulgated the regulation 38 years ago in 1986. BLM’s decades-long delays in developing and approving HMAPs have therefore been ‘nothing short of egregious’ and clearly violate the rule of reason.”
Leigh said that, among other things, the agency’s failure to complete the plan denied the public a chance to address how forage is divided between horses and livestock, herd genetics can be preserved or mitigation measures can be adopted for mining and livestock expanding in the area.
“For over 12 years I have been trying to address critical issues of on-range management planning with BLM and have been repeatedly denied,” Leigh said. “This ruling has finally opened the door to advocacy and actually has the opportunity to engage in management practices.”

California offers catastrophe plan to draw insurers back to the state.

The homeowners insurance crisis in California worsened last week when State Farm General Insurance announced that itwouldn’t renew 72,000 property owner policiesstatewide. Those policies are set to be canceled by summertime.
It’s not just State Farm.
Other insurers, likeAllstateand USAA, have rapidly ceased new business in the Golden State, blaming the intensifying risk of insuring homes in the state’sincreasingly dry, fuel-rich, fire-prone forests. We could be hurtling toward an “uninsurable future.”
Weeks ago, the California Department of Insurance, or CDI, proposed a regulation allowing insurers to usecatastrophe models— computerized processes that simulate potential catastrophic events — to consider the projected impacts of climate change when requesting rate increases.
California hopes this will help lure insurers back.
If approved, insurers couldsubmit catastrophe modelsfor wildfires, floods and terrorism to the CDI and use predictions from these models to justify rate increases.
The state had alreadystruck a dealin September to allow insurers to pass on the costs of reinsurance policies — which they use to help cover their own losses after major catastrophes — to customers in exchange for insurers returning tohigh-risk fire zonesin California’s hills and canyons. The changes are slated to go into effect by the end of 2024.
UnderProposition 103, the state’s law governing the insurance industry, companies had been forbidden from passing on reinsurance costs to customers and were required to set rates  based only on historical fire data.
The CDI believes changing this policy will provide more stable costs than current regulations, which have led to sudden and steep increases for those at higher risk of wildfire.
But advocates say catastrophe modeling isn’t always fair
Consumer Watchdog, an advocacy group, opposes catastrophe modeling, labeling it a violation of Proposition 103, and argues that the policy seems designed to restrict public access to information about how models affect rates.
“Catastrophe models are notoriously contradictory and unreliable, which is why public review and transparency are key before insurance companies are allowed to use them to raise rates,” the groupwrote in a statement.
The regulation proposal is part of Insurance Commissioner Ricardo Lara’sSustainable Insurance Strategy, a package of executive actions aimed at improving insurance choices and addressing the long-term sustainability of California’s insurance market.
Gov. Gavin Newsom issued an executive order in September commanding the insurance commissioner to “take prompt regulatory action to strengthen and stabilize California’s marketplace.”
“This issue isn’t just a yellow flag; it’s a waving red flag,” Newsom said at Climate Week NYC in September, speaking of the Legislature’sfailure to addressthe slow-moving collapse of the property insurance market.
Insurers’ leaving the state has placed extra strain on many homeowners’ last-resort option
State Farm — the state’s longtime leading home insurer— had already announced last June that it would stop offering new property policies in the state due to the “rapidly growing catastrophe exposure and a challenging reinsurance market.”
USAA and Allstatealso pulled back. Farmers capped the number of new policies written monthly. Travelers and Nationwide imposed new restrictions, making it harder for new customers to qualify for policies.
For the record:
9:20 a.m. March 29, 2024An earlier version of this article stated that Allstate stopped offering new property policies in California following State Farm’s June 2023 announcement. Allstate stopped offering new policies to California customers in November 2022.
“This could be the beginning of a market collapse that would leave millions stranded without affordable insurance as their homes burned to the ground,” Times reporter Sam Deanwrote last summer.
A scarcity of insurance choices has driven thousands to purchase limited insurance from theFair Access to Insurance Requirement,or FAIR, Plan, with350,000 Californianscovered as of January 2024. The fund is a last resort insurance pool California requires insurance companies to contribute to based on their statewide market share.
However, a massive leap in enrollment from just under 273,000 two years ago has financially strained the state insurer. The president of the FAIR Plan Assn.warned lawmakersthat the organization may be unable to financially survive a catastrophe.
Californians need insurance. Advocates say insurers can afford more.
Insurance remains the safest protection against personal calamities, whether climate-induced or otherwise, Times columnist Anita Chabriawrote last year. The state’s residents need insurers to remain in the market.
But climate change should not be a free pass for gouging consumers, Chabria said. Despite the cited disaster claims, she pointed out that insurance companies are still making money, albeit with worse profit margins than in the past.
During discussions last summer about the forward-looking models,Harvey Rosenfield, founder of Consumer Watchdog, stated: “This has nothing to do with climate change; it’s about the industry’s greed and its 35-year campaign — so far unsuccessful — to escape the requirements of Prop. 103.”

"California proposal would change how power bills are calculated, aiming to relieve summer spikes",https://www.latimes.com/world-nation/story/2024-03-28/california-proposal-would-change-how-power-bills-are-calculated-aiming-to-relieve-summer-spikes,2024-03-28,"SACRAMENTO —It’s become a rite of summer in sunny California: When the temperature spikes, so do electricity bills, leaving some customers with monthly payments over $500.
A big reason for that is the way California’s largest power companies calculate rates. The more power you use, the more money you pay — not just for electricity, but also for things like maintaining the grid and reducing wildfire risk.
A proposal unveiled Wednesday by state regulators aims to change that. Instead of calculating bills based mostly on how much power people use, a portion would be a fixed charge. For most people, that charge would be $24.15 per month. People who are enrolled in low-income assistance programs or who live in deed-restricted affordable housing would pay less — either $6 or $12, depending on their situation.
To offset this new charge, the rate people pay for using power would go down. During peak hours when electricity is in the most demand — and the most expensive — rates for customers of the state’s big three utilities would fall between 8% and 9.8%. That means the average customer in Fresno, where temperatures were at or above 100 Fahrenheit (37.8 Celsius) for17 days last July, would save about $33 during the summer months, according to the California Public Utilities Commission.
People who own electric cars and charge them at home would save about $25 per month on average, while people who have fully electrified their homes — including replacing gas-powered stoves — would save about $19 per month. Other customers whose bills are not affected  as much by the weather would likely see an increase.
Climate & Environment
Finance officials who objected to the state’s first-ever heat illness prevention rules for indoor workers need to deal with reality.
“I think it’s a wise idea to put us in a position where we’re incentivizing electrification and clean vehicles and then also providing some relief to those customers who really can’t help using a lot of electricity in the summertime,” said Alice Reynolds, president of the California Public Utilities Commission. “This is part of a reaction to a changing climate where we have these extreme weather events.”
California is one of the only states that doesn’t already have a fixed charge for its largest utilities, and the state Legislature ordered regulators in 2022 to implement one by July 1 of this year. Since then, power bills have only gotten more expensive. Regulators approved an average increase of$32 per monthfor Pacific Gas & Electric Company customers just last year. The average price per kilowatt hour of electricity for California’s big three utilities — Pacific Gas & Electric, Southern California Edison and San Diego Gas & Electric — is about 36 cents, compared with  the national average of 17 cents.
The prospect of a new charge that could raise some people’s rates has prompted backlash from some state and federal lawmakers. In the state Legislature, a group of Democrats led by Assemblymember Jacqui Irwin of Thousand Oaks has introduced legislation that would cap the fixed charge at $10 for most people and $5 for people with low incomes. Irwin said the California Public Utilities Commission “is out of touch with consumers.”
“We need to prioritize driving down consumer’s overall bills, not redistributing the ever-increasing (investor-owned utilities) electric rates,” Irwin said.
On Wednesday, a group of 18 members of Congress from California sent a letter to Reynolds urging state regulators to keep the new fixed rate low. Their letter said the average monthly fixed charge in the United States is $11.
“There is little to stop utilities from continuing to increase electric rates once they secure the highest fixed charges in the country,” the letter said.
The Predictable Power Coalition, which includes the big three utilities, called the fixed rate “vital” and said the proposal “is a step in the right direction.” Some of the state’s most well-known consumer advocates, including the Utility Reform Network and the California Public Advocates Office, support the proposal because they say it would make utility bills more affordable.
Others, including the solar industry, worry that if electricity rates are cheaper during peak hours people won’t conserve as much energy. California has struggled at times to have enough electricity during these periods, especially during extreme heat waves, which caused somerolling blackouts in 2020.
Climate & Environment
Read all of our coverage about how California is neglecting the climate threat posed by extreme heat.
“In this time when it’s all hands on deck about climate change, why would we have people say, ‘You know what? I’m not going to hang out my laundry today because I’m just paying a fixed charge anyway,’” said Bill Allayaud, California director of governmental affairs for the Environmental Working Group.
Reynolds noted that California’s big three utilities will still charge more for power during peak hours but that the fixed charge would make sure the increase is more evenly distributed among customers. She also noted the big three had proposed fixed rate charges of $51 and $73. The commission rejected those amounts.
Most of California’s publicly owned utilities already have a fixed charge as part of their billing structure. Regulators’ proposal mirrors the fixed rate charged by the Sacramento Municipal Utilities District.
“Millions of people already have a flat rate component of their bills. They may not know it,” Reynolds said.
If it’s approved by regulators, the rule would take effect in 2025, and customers would not see the charge until later that year or in early 2026.

Catch the snow at these spots in the San Gabriel Mountains — while supplies last,https://www.latimes.com/travel/newsletter/2024-03-28/catch-the-snow-at-these-spots-in-the-san-gabriel-mountains-while-supplies-last-the-wild,2024-03-28,"Since moving to Los Angeles in 2018, I’ve kept up an important annual tradition: getting my feet into  snow. Fortunately, I’ve never had to travel far to do it. When winter and early spring rains come to the Southland, the San Gabriel Mountains above L.A. get plastered with powder (cueincredible vistas). They say in Los Angeles that you can catch some waves at the beach in the morning and then hit the ski slopes in the afternoon. Unlike many things people say about our city, this one is actually true — and absolutely worth doing.

I recently made my winter pilgrimage to the San Gabriels, and it was a classic sun and snow experience. I woke up to a mild and sunny L.A. spring morning, took my dog for a walk and then packed up my snowshoes, snow pants and backpack. After a quick stop for breakfast atBub and Grandma’sin Glassell Park and an hour or so of driving up Angeles Crest Highway, I found the snow.
It emerged gradually, first in small patches along the road and then in glimpses of white peaks catching the morning light. When I pulled off the pavement near Waterman Mountain, I was in a different world. All around me, the slopes were blanketed in snow. Thick gray clouds scudded overhead, dumping flakes and dusting everything with a fresh coat of powder. Breaks in the clouds created roving patches of sunlight that lit up the frosty ground and cast long shadows from the towering pine trees.
I pulled on my gear — in addition to snowshoes, snow pants and a backpack with water and snacks, I always pack boots, gloves, a warm hat and an insulated jacket — and headed out on the Waterman Mountain trail, one of my favorite routes for wintertime exploring. Although I’ve hiked and snowshoed here several times before, it’s always interesting to see how winter transforms the landscape. The trail was barely visible under the snow (good thing I had a map on my fully charged phone), and I passed several creeks roaring with snowmelt. When I’m snowshoeing, I don’t have any goal in mind — instead of aiming for a summit, I slow down and take my time. I try to soak in my surroundings, knowing that in a month or so this snowy scene will likely be gone.
Although we’re now officially into spring, there’s still time to get your wintertime fix in the San Gabriels. If you go, check the weather first, as conditions in the mountains are very different from what’s happening in the city. Fill up your car’s gas tank, and be aware that Angeles Crest Highway is  partly closed, soyou’ll need to detouraround the closure to get to higher elevations.
When I ventured into the mountains in mid-March, the snow coverage started around 7,000 feet. For the latest info, the National Operational Hydrologic Remote Sensing Center  has a greatinteractive mapthat shows the snow depth in the San Gabriels.
I began my snowshoe trip at theWaterman trailhead, though you can also drive farther on Angeles Crest Highway and park at theKratka Ridge parking areaor atIslip Saddle(the road is closed past that). Bring anAdventure Pass; it’s required to park at Waterman and Islip Saddle.
Prefer to ski or snowboard? You’re in luck. TheMt. Waterman ski areaopened this month (call 818-790-2002 to check if they’re running before visiting) andMt. BaldyandMountain Highare also reliable destinations for skiing in the San Gabriels. Make sure to check their websites before heading up, as their operating hours can change depending on the weather.

The event is free and kicks off in the Wildwood Park parking lot at 10 a.m.  April 8. You can sign up ateventbrite.com.
Lately I’ve been thinking a lot about Alex Wigglesworth’sstory on wildfiresand their effect on the Mojave Desert. The desert has seen an unusual amount of fire in the last few years, and with climate change bringing drought and erratic precipitation patterns, experts predict flames will become even more prevalent. But fire wasn’t always so rare here. Before the arrival of white settlers, the Mojave was covered in native grasses, and the region experienced fires on a regular basis. Check out the article for a deeper look at how researchers and land managers are trying to understand fire’s natural role in a desert landscape that has changed drastically — and continues to evolve with each passing year.
Happy adventuring,
In the spring, wildflowersget all the attention, but this is a great time of year for clouds too. Rain showers and evenrare coastal thunderstormsare creating all kinds of interesting shapes in the sky. As you’re going about your day, make sure to look up.

Column: Climate change is a star in some of Hollywood’s most popular movies,https://www.latimes.com/environment/newsletter/2024-04-30/column-climate-change-is-a-star-in-some-of-hollywoods-most-popular-movies-boiling-point,2024-04-30,"I never saw the 2017 film “Justice League.” But if I had, I would have been treated to a scene in which Batman (Ben Affleck) tries to persuade Aquaman, Protector of the Oceans (Jason Momoa) to join his band of superheroes by referencing the climate crisis.
“Mankind’s melting the polar ice caps, destroying the ecosystem,” Batman warns.
“Hey, I don’t mind if the oceans rise,” Aquaman responds.
“How about if they boil?” Batman asks ominously.
That scene is a great example of how Hollywood movie and TV studios can keep climate change and clean energy solutions top of mind for audiences — and thus motivate people to take action — while also telling entertaining stories, according to anew reportfrom Colby College’s Buck Lab for Climate and Environment and the nonprofit consulting firm Good Energy.

The report — shared with The Times ahead of its release Tuesday — examined 250 of the most popular films of the last decade, based on quantity of IMDb ratings. Researchers at Maine’s Colby and the University of Utah applied thenewly developed Climate Reality Check— which measures whether a film and its characters acknowledge the existence of global warming — to the most frequently rated fictional movies set in present-day or near-future Earth and released from 2013 through 2022.
One key finding: Just under 10% of the 250 movies passed the Climate Reality Check.
Is that a lot, or not very many?
Personally I was encouraged, especially after aprevious USC analysisfound that just 2.8% of scripted films and TV episodes from 2016 through 2020 included any mention of climate change, or a long list of related keywords. The number of movies passing the Climate Reality Check went up over time, from 5.6% during the first half of the decade to 13.6% during the second half.
Things are moving in the right direction. Still, there’s a lot of room for improvement.
“Given the stakes of the climate crisis, and the incredible urgency of this issue, it’s hard to say 10% is a positive number,” said Matthew Schneider-Mayerson, an English and environmental studies professor at Colby and the report’s lead author.
Keeping the heat waves, wildfires, storms and droughts of the climate crisis to (relatively) manageable levels will require cutting carbon pollution from fossil fuels, agriculture and other industriesmore than 40%in the next six years, scientists say. That won’t happen unless we start building a lot more solar panels, wind turbines and other climate solutions a lot more quickly — and that won’t be possible without unprecedented political support, even following President Biden’s landmarkInflation Reduction Act.
The entertainment industry, whichplays a powerful rolein shaping our cultural norms and values, could help bring it about.
Fortunately, there’s a growing movement within Hollywood to get directors, writers and producers on board.
The Natural Resources Defense Council’sRewrite the Futureteam works with major studios, including NBCUniversal and Netflix, to tell more and better climate stories. NBCUniversal’s GreenerLight Program aims to incorporate sustainability themes in films released by Universal Pictures, Focus Features and DreamWorks Animation. NBCUniversal recentlyhosted a Hollywood Climate Summit “pitchfest”at its Universal Studios lot, bringing together screenwriters to pitch their stories to development executives.
Just this month, the Walt Disney Co. made headlines bypromising to convert the polluting gasoline vehiclesat Disneyland’s classic Autopia attraction to electric cars by 2026, prompted by a series of L.A. Times stories and pressure from climate advocates.
The climate crisis is “an incredibly exciting story, replete with drama, comedy, tragedy, horror, adventure, love, conflict, real-life villains, massive stakes, and a million potential heroes from all walks of life,” the Colby College report says. “Storytellers can help us face and respond to the existential crisis that is unfolding around us — and in doing so, they might just help save the world.”
Schneider-Mayerson , the report’s author, didn’t spend much time thinking about global warming in movies and TV shows before he started working with Good Energy to develop the Climate Reality Check, despite climate being his academic focus.
“Like everybody else, I turn to entertainment for some distraction,” he said.
But now that he’s paying attention, it’s like an energy-efficient light bulb switched on in his head. He sees huge opportunities for scenes like the one in “Justice League” to keep people focused on climate when they otherwise would have lost the plot.
Crucially, movies and TV shows don’t need to be all about climate to pass the test. In fact, it’s often better if they aren’t exclusively climate-focused. Many people find doomsday stories such as“The Day After Tomorrow”or“Extrapolations”depressing. And other potential viewers consider those types of productions political propaganda and want nothing to do with them.
Better to slip references to climate and clean energy into stories about other topics — like “hiding the spinach in the popcorn,” as one production executivetold me recently. Schneider-Mayerson cited “Triangle of Sadness,” a 2022 comedy with two quick, clever references to the fashion industry’s tendency to ignore the climate crisis, despite itsmajor rolein global carbon pollution.
“People don’t necessarily want to be hit over the head with sad climate stories,” he said. “Humor is important.”
A few other findings from the report: Among the 220 movies analyzed by researchers that were released in theaters, the 20 that passed the Climate Reality Check earned 10% more at the box office, on average, than films that failed the test.
That’s far from conclusive proof that climate-aware movies make more money. But it should signal to Hollywood executives that telling stories about the world we live in — a world on fire, a world gettinghotter all the time, a worldfilled with solutions— isn’t a losing business proposition. There are certainly climate deniers, but not many. Surveys consistently find that a large majority of Americans support climate action,including younger Republicans.
Speaking of which, Schneider-Mayerson and his Colby undergraduates also found that the 250 films largely misrepresented who is most concerned about global warming. They noted that roughly two-thirds of the characters who showed any awareness of the climate crisis were white — and nearly 70% were male. Yalesurveyshave found that in the U.S., Latino and Black adults are more likely to be concerned about climate change, as are women. Hollywood should correct that portrayal going forwarding.
TheColby reportalso compared the performance of different production companies.
Streamers Amazon, Apple TV+ and Netflix scored the best overall on the Climate Reality Check, with 16.7% of their TV shows and movies passing the test. Among the five big traditional studios graded by researchers — Paramount, Sony, Universal, Disney and Warner Bros. — the overall pass rate was 10.3%, with Warner Bros. leading the way and Paramount bringing up the rear.
Among genres, romances, biographies and animated films were some of the least likely to acknowledge global warming. Sci-fi, adventure, mystery, action and thriller films were the most likely. Schneider-Mayerson had a theory as to why.
“These genres tend to operate at epic scales at which the future of the planet is at stake,” he said. “In these contexts, filmmakers may feel more comfortable including climate change as an epic threat on top of the aliens that are already coming.”
Superhero films in particular seem to be ripe territory to raise the stakes — but not all studios are taking advantage of that.
Of the 13 Warner Bros. flicks based on DC Comics characters such as Batman, Superman and Wonder Woman, 30.7% passed the climate test. But of the 24 films from Disney’s Marvel Cinematic Universe — my personal favorite — just 8.3% passed.
“Climate change is the biggest story of our time, and the stage is set for Hollywood to accept its greatest role,” the report says.
Sounds like it’s time for the Avengers to assemble.
On that note, here’s what’s happening around the West:
It’s possible you’ve heard the saying that whiskey is for drinking and water is for fighting over.But you’ve probably never heard a story of water theftquite so spellbinding as this one, from my L.A. Times colleague Jessica Garrison, about an irrigation district leader who allegedly siphoned water from a federal government canal in California’s San Joaquin Valley for 23 years, to supply farmers and line his own pockets. It’s a doozy of a tale. In other news, California is increasing planed water deliveries to farms and cities to 40% of full allocations from the State Water Project — and the number would be higher if not for restrictions designed to protect native fish in the Sacramento-San Joaquin River Delta.Details herefrom The Times’ Ian James.
New research from the U.S. Geological Survey finds the atmospheric rivers that hit the Golden State the last two winters were nothing compared to the monster storms that slammed ancient California — even before the climate crisis.We may have gottenreally lucky during the 20th century, The Times’ Grace Toohey writes. I’m not scared, you’re scared. In a related story, some scientists say we may need to think about a Category 6 hurricane rating as storms get stronger due to rising temperatures. But they also say the simple ratingsdon’t convey the seriousness of the threat, my colleague Corinne Purtill reports. Researchers at the nonprofit Climate Central, meanwhile, released new research tracking thegrowing number of blackoutscaused by extreme heat and wildfires, per the San Francisco Chronicle’s Jack Lee. Their work is a reminder that as much as we fret about keeping the lights on when there’s not enough wind and solar energy, climate change is a much bigger threat to reliable power.
The Biden administration finalized a bunch of regulations that will crack down on climate and air pollution from power plants, possibly forcing many coal plants to close — eventually.The Washington Post’s Maxine Joselow has agreat rundown. Montana’s Colstrip plant could be in trouble, with the facility’s operatorsestimating$600 million in compliance costs based on a draft version of one of the rules last year, per Amanda Eggert at Montana Free Press. I bring up Colstrip in particular because I recently visited the coal-fired power plant, which supplies electricity to Oregon and Washington; check outmy in-depth story, in case you missed it. See also my column from last week on the32 coal plants still operating in the American West.
For much of March and April, California had enough renewable energy flowing onto its main power grid to meet at least 100% of electricity demand for at least 15 minutes a day.That’s a springtime phenomenon — not too hot, lots of sunshine — but it’s still a sign of remarkable progress.Details herefrom Politico’s Francisco “A.J.” Camacho. The flip side is that California has had lots of extra solar power flooding the grid during the middle of the day that we’re basically throwing away. Still, those solar panels continue to provide value later in the afternoon and evening, especially with more homes and utilities investing in batteries to store solar for after dark, as the Washington Post’s Shannon Osakanotes. The state just hit a milestone10,000 megawatts of batteries, my L.A. Times colleague Melody Petersen reports — 13 times our battery capacity just five years ago.
The Biden administration finalized a plan to speed up construction of long-distance electric lines crucial for transmitting renewable energy from solar and wind farms to large cities.The plan includes centralized federal permitting — a notoriously difficult task for transmission developers who often grapple with opposition from rural landowners, conservationists and Native American tribes, as E&E News’ Jason Plautz and Peter Behrreport. Federal officials also announced $331 million in funds for a power line that should help move wind energy from Idaho to the Southwest. The money could help spur development of Lava Ridge, a controversial wind farm that I wrote about inPart 4 of Repowering the West, an L.A. Times series exploring the energy transition.
Pacific Gas & Electric Chief Executive Patti Poppe got paid $17 million last year.As the San Francisco Chronicle’s Emma Stiefelreports, that’s less than the $27.4 million dished out to Jeffrey Martin, CEO of Sempra Energy (parent company of San Diego Gas & Electric and Southern California Gas) but more than the $14.9 million taken home by Pedro Pizarro, leader of Edison International (parent of Southern California Edison). By comparison, Janisse Quiñones, Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass’ nominee to run the city’s Department of Water and Power,will earn $750,000, The Times’ Dakota Smith reports. That doesn’t mean everything is perfect at L.A.’s publicly owned utility; a leaked internal report found “a cliquey environment where employees received plum positions and promotions based on their relationships with top leaders, rather than their job performance,”as Dakota writes.
Gov. Gavin Newsom will speak at a climate summit hosted by Pope Francis at the Vatican.“This year holds unprecedented significance for democracy and the climate, two intertwined issues which will define our future,” Newsom said, as my L.A. Times colleague Taryn Lunareports. Back home, meanwhile, we have a lot of work still to do. The American Lung Assn. just released its annual list of the nation’s most-polluted places, and seven of the 10 counties with the worst ozone pollutionare in California, The Times’ Tony Briscoe reports. The $12 billion high-speed train between Southern California and Las Vegas thatjust broke groundshould help, by reducing car and truck traffic. (Story by Karen Garcia and Rachel Uranga.) Hopefully the nation’s first commercial hydrogen fueling station for big-rig trucks, whichjust openedat the Port of Oakland, will help too. (Story by Russ Mitchell.)
California lawmakers blocked a bill that would have stopped monopoly utilities from spending customer money on what critics say are thinly veiled public relations campaigns, such as TV ads in which Pacific Gas & Electric brags about burying power lines to reduce wildfire risk.The Associated Press’ Adam Beamreportsthat the bill was voted down in the state Senate’s energy committee — whose chair is Sen. Steven Bradford, a former public affairs manager for Southern California Edison, which like PG&E opposed the bill. Legislators also rejected a bill that would have prevented new monthly fees on electric bills for Edison and PG&E customers, as Politiconotesin its California Climate newsletter. I wrote about the monthly fee debatehere.
Climate politics are also the politics of human health — and affordable living.Two examples. First, my L.A. Times colleague Laurence Darmiento reports that home insurers, which have been fleeing California, could start returning if state officials adopt rate reforms that take into account the reality of wildfire risks worsened by climate change. But some consumer watchdogs say the proposed rate reforms are basicallyan excuse for higher premiums. Second example: As the planet heats up, mosquitoes are spreading diseases to new places. The Times’ Lila Seidman wrote about afascinating effortto limit Southern California mosquito populations. It involves releasing sterile males to breed with females, spoiling their eggs. If you’re looking to stay safe during the heat this summer, the federal government has a new tool called HeatRisk that can help.Details herefrom Karen Garcia.
Painted Canyon, in the Mecca Hills east of the Coachella Valley, is one of my favorite places, and basically where I learned to love hiking.I didn’t know it when I first visited, but it’s part of a larger landscape sacred to the Torres Martinez Desert Cahuilla Indians, and it would beat the heart of the proposed Chuckwalla National Monument, as my L.A. Times colleague Tyrone Beason reports in a beautiful story exploring the area’s cultural and environmental significance. In Oregon, meanwhile, Indigenous tribes and conservationists hope President Biden will establish an even larger national monumentprotecting the Owyhee Canyonlands, as Kylie Mohr writes for High Country News. And off the California coast, tribal leadersreached a compromisewith offshore wind energy developers on plans for a Pacific Ocean marine sanctuary, per the San Luis Obispo Tribune’s Stephanie Zappelli.
Did the reintroduction of wolves to Yellowstone National Park launch a “trophic cascade” that helped restore the beloved park’s ecosystems?Scientists used to agree that was the case, but now some researchersaren’t so sure, the New York Times’ Jim Robbins reports. In other wildlife news, federal officials are planning to reintroduce grizzly bears to North Cascades National Park. The hard part will belimiting conflictswith livestock, hikers, wolverines and salmon, the Seattle Times’ Isabella Breda writes. Here in Southern California, the L.A. County Board of Supervisors voted to oppose a plan to reduce the size of Catalina Island’s invasive mule deer population by shooting deer from helicopters.Details herefrom my L.A. Times colleague Andrew J. Campa.
California is opening its first state park in nearly a decade, near the confluence of the Tuolumne and San Joaquin rivers in the heavily farmed San Joaquin Valley.“The park will give visitors a glimpse of what the valley’s waterways were like before the arrival of agriculture, but it will be a while before the site offers many activities,” as The Times’ Christopher Reynoldswrites. About 85 miles north, Apple Inc. is helping fund a floodplain restoration project at the confluence of Sacramento and Feather rivers near Sacramento International Airport, which supporters hope couldeventually become a state park, the Sacramento Bee’s Ari Plachta reports. And as a reminder that successful conservation requires sustained political follow-through, seethis columnby The Times’ George Skelton, lamenting California’s failure to save to save steelhead trout in the Ventura, Santa Clara and Santa Ynez rivers.
I was lucky to spend some time this weekend atJepson Prairie Preservein Northern California’s Solano County. The wildflowers weregorgeous, the vernal pools fascinating. And perhaps best of all (for me, an energy geek), there was awind farmwithin sight, hundreds of spinning blades generating climate-friendly power, some of it almost certainly passing through the electric wires that ran above our heads, generating a low buzz but otherwise not disturbing the preserve’s flora and fauna, so far as I could tell.
Did building a power line through the ecosystem cause some damage? I’d have to do more research, but I’m sure it wasn’t pain-free. Are some wind and solar projects proposed for places where the damage would be far worse than others?Absolutely.
But as for this wind farm, and this power line? It hasn’t been so bad for Jepson Prairie.
“It’s pretty copacetic,” said Nicole Braddock, executive director of Solano Land Trust, which operates the preserve.
I had a great time chatting with my L.A. Times colleague Judeh the Sheep Puppet (aka Safi Nazzal) about why Disneyland made the great decision to convert Autopia to electric vehicles — and why EVs won’t solve all our problems, either. You can watch the videoon Instagram. You can also catch on my reporting — which helped prompt Disney’s Autopia decision —here.

Can satellites combat wildfires? Inside the booming ‘space race’ to fight the flames,https://www.latimes.com/environment/story/2024-05-30/a-look-inside-the-satellite-race-to-fight-wildfires,2024-05-30,"As the threat of wildfire worsens in California and across the world, a growing number of federal agencies, nonprofit organizations and tech companies are racing to deploy new technology that will help combat flames from a whole new vantage point: outer space.
New satellite missions backed by NASA, Google, SpaceX, the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection and other groups were announced this week  and promise to advance early wildfire detection and help reduce fire damage by monitoring Earth from above.
Collectively, the roster of big names, billionaires, government groups and  nongovernmental organizations reflects a considerable interest in using new technology to solve some of humanity’s biggest problems.
Climate & Environment
Fire weather days have increased in Western U.S. over the last 50 years, with some of the largest jumps in California, according to a new report by Climate Central, a nonprofit news outlet that reports on climate change.
Among them is theEarth Fire Alliance, a global nonprofit coalition that recently unveiled its vision for a constellation of more than 50 satellites that will focus specifically on wildfires and their ecological effects.
Known as FireSat, the orbiting surveillance network  will scan the globe every 20 minutes in search of wildfire activity — analyzing the landscape across six spectral bands that can spot signs of fires through clouds, smoke, darkness and extreme sunlight, according to the organization. The first three satellites will be launched and operational by 2026.
“It’s really a game-changer when it comes to resource allocation, because now we have this really high-fidelity picture that’s very, very granular of every single fire, which will ultimately help us better deploy resources in a much more efficient manner,” said Chris Anthony, an Earth Fire Alliance board member and former chief deputy director at Cal Fire.
Data and images gathered from FireSat will not only inform crews about the location of fires, but also how hot they are and how fast they are moving — helping to guide firefighting, emergency operations and evacuations, Anthony said.
He noted that during his career battling blazes, he often wondered when California would use its reputation as a global hub of technology and innovation to tackle the issue of wildfires.
“With every large wildfire we have — and the emissions and the carbon that’s released in that smoke — I feel like we’re in this negative feedback loop, which is going to be really hard for us to get out of,” he said. “And I strongly believe that technology and innovation is a core component of our ability to turn this ship in the other direction. I mean, we have to — I don’t think we have a choice.”
Climate & Environment
Fire weather days have increased in Western U.S. over the last 50 years, with some of the largest jumps in California, according to a new report by Climate Central, a nonprofit news outlet that reports on climate change.
Indeed, while California has enjoyed tworelatively tame fire seasonsthanks to back-to-back wet winters, the threat has not dissipated.
The state has experienced the majority of itslargest,deadliestand mostdestructive blazessince the year 2000, according to data from Cal Fire. The state’sworst wildfire year on record, 2020, saw nearly 4.4 million acres burn and the state’s first million-acre fire,the August Complex.
Experts say wildfires here are expected to grow larger, faster and more frequent in the years ahead due in part towarmer and drier conditionsdriven by human-caused climate change, as well as vegetation buildup and forest management practices. Similar trends are expected globally, where wildfires are projected toincrease 30% by mid-century, according to the United Nations.
Earlier this year, Texas experienced itslargest wildfire on record, which burned through more than a million acres, claimed two lives and killed at least 7,000 cattle.
Last year, a relentless procession of fires seared more than 45 million acres across Canada and sentnoxious smoke billowinginto parts of the United States and all the way to Europe.
“Even though California has been at the epicenter of so many large and destructive fires, it is becoming super clear that the wildfire problem that we have right now isn’t just a California, or a Western states, problem, but it is truly a global issue that we need to resolve,” Anthony said.
Climate & Environment
Forecasters are anticipating a late start to California’s wildfire season, but they can’t yet say whether it will be severe.
The Earth Fire Alliance’s satellites will join similar missions from NASA and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. The agencies announced this week that theywill soon launch GOES-U, the last in their series of four advanced weather satellites, which provide continuous monitoring of much of the Western Hemisphere.
#SATELLITESPOTLIGHT:@NOAA's#GOES17🛰️ was tracking the explosive growth of the#CaldorFirelast evening, seen here burning east of Sacramento, California. The#wildfirehas grown to nearly 23,000 acres and thousands of people have been forced to evacuate.#CAwxpic.twitter.com/9LD0YI6mck
Roughly the size of a small school bus, the GOES-U satellite was designed and built in partnership with defense contractors Lockheed Martin and L3Harris. It will lift off on June 25 aboard a SpaceX Falcon Heavy Rocket from NASA’s Kennedy Space Center in Florida, and will provide rapid data for tracking severe storms, including destructive wildfires and their smoke, as well as tropical systems, floods, lightning, snowstorms, dense fogs and other hazards, officials said.
“NOAA’s geostationary satellites are an indispensable tool for protecting the United States and the  1 billion people who live and work in the Americas,” Pam Sullivan, director of NOAA’s Office of Geostationary Earth Orbit Observations, told reporters Wednesday.
GOES-U — which will be renamed GOES-19 once in orbit — will scan the Earth every 10 minutes, and can zoom in to track dangerous storms and hazards with 30-second updates, she said.
It will also carry the first operationalcompact coronagraphthat will help detect space weather for early warnings of disruptions to power grids, communications and navigation systems. Earlier this month, apowerful geomagnetic stormprompted some reports of such impacts.
The GOES series will play a critical role inhurricane tracking, but perhaps its “biggest game-changing aspect” is its ability to detect wildfires, said Dan Lindsey, a program scientist with NOAA.
“We knew it could detect fires, of course, but it is able to do this in a much more impressive way than we foresaw,” Lindsey said. He said the GOES series has already detected fires the size of a small barn, but the new imaging tools will have four times better spatial resolution on its fire detection band.
“This is important because it allows us to get the word out to emergency responders, firefighters and take care of those fires as quickly as possible,” he said.
California
Cal Fire is the first fire agency to use artificial intelligence to look for signs of wildfires and directly alert dispatch centers.
Experts are also experimenting with more terrestrial technology to combat conflagrations, including the use of artificial intelligence tools to fight wildfires in California.
One program — a Cal Fire partnership with UC San Diego’sALERTCalifornia systemannounced last year — includes more than 1,000 high-definition cameras across the state thatuse AI to scan the landscape and alert fire crews to burgeoning blazes.
The system is already proving effective, with its pilot program flagging dozens of fires before 911 calls came in, officials said.
Still, space is its own frontier which brings with it its own set of challenges. Rocket launches are known toemit considerable planet-warming carbon dioxide, along with black carbon, methane and other pollutants.
Last fall, a United Nations report also warned ofnew risks from growing  space debris— including roughly 8,300 satellites and 35,000 other tracked objects that are circling the Earth, many of which are used for weather monitoring, early warning systems and global communications.
Too many orbiting objects run the risk of collision, which could set off a chain reaction that takes those systems offline,the report said.
But new regulations and designs are helping to mitigate some of those risks, said Brian Collins, interim executive director at Earth Fire Alliance. The potentially life- and property-saving benefits of the technology are also part of the balance.
A new economic report published by the alliance and the consulting firm Mandala Partners found that early detection of fires could reduce annual direct fire damage costs by approximately $1.2 billion across the U.S., Australia and Southern Europe. Wildfires in the U.S. alone cost about $11.3 billion annually, with property damage accounting for a large part of that — a trend that hasalready seen some insurers flee the Golden Stateand other fire-prone regions.
Indirect costs from fires in the U.S. could be as large as $415 billion annually, including labor productivity losses and health costs, the report found. Almost half — 46% — of the wildfire costs are borne by local communities and businesses.
World & Nation
Conditions on the West Coast may be calmer than last year, when a rare storm swirled off the coast of Baja California before making landfall in early August.
The Earth Fire Alliance’s suite of satellites will fly at a lower orbit — about 370 miles from Earth compared with NOAA’s 22,000 miles — affording even more granular information in real time, Collins said.
“We view it as complementary to the big, heavy lift systems that NOAA and NASA produce,” he said. “Knowing where a fire is — on this side of the road or that side of a road, or on one side of a hill or another — is very important to the ecosystem and to the first responders.”
The Earth Fire Alliance raised $12 million in its early round of investments, and is on its way to securing an additional $50 million to $60 million to get the first three satellites into space, he said. The full constellation of 50 or more satellites will require about $300 million to $400 million, some of which will come from partnerships.
The alliance’s supporters include Google.org, the Environmental Defense Fund, the Minderoo Foundation and the Gordon & Betty Moore Foundation.
It made sense to tackle the issue of wildfires through the nonprofit structure, which can move more nimbly than government agencies that are tied to specific funding cycles, Collins said. However, data captured by FireSat can be integrated with NASA and NOAA and will be provided to all users for free.
“The reason for the organization was largely those two things — capturing a budgetary process, and interest and passion that can move a little quicker,” he said. “This was a nice blend to fill a gap of a capability while advancing the mission.”
Anthony, the former Cal Fire chief, said the FireSat program will not only help guide attacks on ongoing fires, but also provide an added layer of intelligence aroundprescribed fires, or fires that are intentionally set to clear vegetation and preserve forest health. For instance, the tools can help assess the right time to apply prescribed fire, track the fire’s intensity and integrate it with fire modeling.
The thousand-mile view afforded by the satellites will mark a new era of firefighting tools with a fidelity and resolution that have never been seen before, Anthony added.
“You can understand anything if you can see everything,” he said.

What’s behind the anti-Biden ‘wildfire’ among TikTok influencers,https://www.latimes.com/politics/story/2024-05-30/2024-election-tik-tok-influencers-biden-trump,2024-05-30,"WASHINGTON —President Biden has been courting Kahlil Greene and other young TikTokinfluencerssince taking office, inviting them to celebrations at the White House and policy briefings on Zoom, where Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris have been known to pop in.
There’s a reason this cohort gets so much attention from an 81-year-old president. About a third of adults under 30 get their news from short, punchy videos onTikTok,according to a  Pew Research Center survey released in November. Add in Instagram Reels, YouTube Shorts and other platforms, and the reach of social media grows.
Greene, 24, posts videos linking history with present issues about race and gender,  drawing about 650,000 followers on TikTok and roughly  146,000 on Instagram. His posts, which include some paid content, have generated 3 million TikTok views in the last three months.
But Biden hasn’t been inviting Greene to White House celebrations in recent months. Greene and some other progressives believe they have been left out because of their criticism; the White House did not respond when asked about it. And Greene isn’t sure whether he would attend anyway. If it’s just a photo op, no thanks. If he can ask tough questions, OK.
Greene’s skepticism exemplifies the challenges Biden and his allies face as they try to navigate a new class of media gatekeepers. Not only are they more prone to go off the campaign’s message than a traditional surrogate, many have also become more jaded  and more demanding, both politically and financially.
In 2020, TikTok was just starting to bloom as a political town square. Many of the progressive creators were new to politics and united behind the Black Lives Matter movement and their displeasure with then-President Trump and the pandemic.
Four years later, more than a fifth of the top left-leaning creators on TikTok  posted explicitly anti-Biden content — accounting for more than 100 million views during the first four months of this year — according to data from  CredoIQ, an analytics firm, that were shared with The Times.
This concentrated group of creators represents a small minority of young voters with an outsize voice, who are mostly angry with Biden’s response to the war betweenIsrael and Hamas,the analysis shows.
But there is a larger universe of users who were already upset with Biden over a lawhe signedin April that wouldban TikTokwithin a year if the Chinese firm ByteDance fails to sell it. Greene and other progressives are drawing links between the two issues, arguing that the TikTok law is aimed at stifling dissent over the war,  a claim the White House disputes.
“What I would be concerned about is kind of the wildfire anti-Biden movement leaping from anti-Biden progressives to a larger group of young people,” said Ben Darr, president and founder of CredoIQ.
The larger group is less interested in politics but sees TikTok as their main source of news, entertainment, relationships and education around certain topics, said Darr, who shared his findings with the Los Angeles Times.
A White House spokesperson notes that thebipartisanTikTok law had been in the works before the Israel-Hamas war started and said that the chief concern is over the Chinese government’s ability to access users’ sensitive data and to manipulate the company’s secret algorithms, which  control what videos go viral.
But if anger over the  war and the TikTok law continues to converge online, it could deepen Biden’s trouble with young voters, who are wavering, according to some polls, after supporting the president overwhelmingly in 2020. A majority of voters support the TikTok law, according to a recentABC News poll.But only 39% of adults younger than 30 think it’s a good idea.
“It’s astonishing and, like, actually something hard — to make Trump have a viable path to becoming president again,” Greene said. But Biden is “actively making decisions that are unpopular.”
Greene said he will decide who to vote for “as events play out” but won’t reveal his decision on his social media feed.
In the meantime, Trump content is generating about 500 million views a month on the site, compared with more than 300 million for Biden posts, as of late May. And Trump videos are much more likely to be posted by allies than Biden videos,according to CredoIQ data.
That adds to a similar advantage Trump has on Facebook, which reaches an older audience. Conservatives produced more than 70,000 posts about Biden in the first half of this year, compared with about 18,000 posts about Biden from liberals, according to an analysis prepared for The Times by Media Matters for America, a left-leaning group that tracks content.
The Facebook advantage isnot new.Trump has been mining the platform since  2016, when he took advantage of the site’s propensity to elevate content that elicits outrage and anger.
TikTok’s younger-skewing audience seemed a better bet for Biden, who putclimate policyand racial equity at the center of his agenda. He defeated Trump by 24 percentage points among voters younger than 30 in 2020.
But it wasn’t easy getting there. Biden’s reputation on TikTok was dismal in the summer of 2020, according to Daniel Daks, who consulted for the 2020 campaign and  runs a private social media consulting firm called Palette MGMT. Posts with #Trump2020 received 6.2 billion views through the first six months of 2020, while #Biden2020 posts got 703.8 million views, according to an analysis he did at the time for the campaign.
“Republicans tend to have more of a cult of personality” around Trump, whereas Democrats are more policy focused, which creates a disparity on social media, he said.
Gen Z voters are also more inclined to shift from booster to activist mode after an election, which puts more pressure on an incumbent, he said.
But he argues that young people, including many critics, will coalesce around Biden as the contrast with Trump draws starker in the coming months.
“It will come organically,” he predicted.
::
Biden has ramped up  efforts to accelerate that process as November approaches. The administration invited dozens of influencers to the White House for this year’sState of the Unionaddress, where they recorded selfies from the portico as the president’s motorcade came and went from the Capitol.
The Biden campaign and affiliated committees are spending millions of dollars on dozens of staff members whose jobs involve creating content and building relationships with influencers. The campaign said it does not pay influencers for their posts, but many outside groups that advocate for the environment, voting rights and other Democratic issues do.
Progressive groups that work with social media influencers have been increasing their own engagement substantially since 2020 but say the demands of influencers have grown.
People working in the industry said fees range from $500 to upward of $10,000 for a single-issue social media post (still a fraction of what influencers make working for commercial customers), with many creators retaining agents and negotiating double the rates they charged four years ago. There is also a burgeoning industry of firms devoted to identifying  accounts that have the right target audience and compatible message.
NextGen America, a group funded by California billionaire Tom Steyer, has been especially active in using influencers to help Democrats, with plans to work with 900 creators in swing states after an aggressive influencer campaign in the 2022 midterm elections.
“Young voters are not as enthusiastic about the top of the ticket,” said Antonio Arellano, NextGen’s vice president of communications. “We’re leading with the issues as much as we can.”
The group was one of the first in politics to hire college athletes for a voter registration  campaign  using new rules that allow student athletes to get paid. Many of the students hired by NextGen to encourage voter registration have only a few thousand followers. But political specialists who work in social media say the most important thing influencers bring to an issue is trust, making so-called micro-influencers valuable.
Audiences on social media tend to distrust institutional sources and may think they have a personal relationship with creators, paying more attention to their informal videos than they would traditional advertisements. That trust  can also be helpful in combating online misinformation.
The trade-off is that campaigns can lose some control, because the influencers use their own language and may veer from the campaign’s message, especially if their followers post angry messages in the comment section. Biden has seen that difficulty firsthand, as creators use their platforms to attack his policies on the environment or the Israel-Hamas war.
Supporters still see a window for Biden, especially on other issues. Young people want concrete accomplishments, which gives the president a path toward reaching people with more information about his record on the economy, abortion and education, said Jack Lobel, a college student serving as press secretary for a pro-Biden group called Voters of Tomorrow.
The majority of voters in that age group still place a higher importance on those issues than the Israel-Hamas war, even though young people are at the center of campus protests, according to polls.
The mix of content onTikTok— videos of cats vomiting in a toilet interspersed with people acting silly in their pajamas — can be mystifying for political consultants trying to implant a traditional  message. But older people often mistake the platform’s sometimes playful nature for superficiality, Lobel said, adding, “We don’t just want to see politicians dancing on our TikTok.”
Biden has his share of unabashed allies such asHarry Sisson,who posts constantly on social media about the Democrats’ policy achievements and the president’s warmth to Sisson’s more than 800,000 TikTok followers. Sisson made a campaign video with former President Obama during the 2022 midterms that helped solidify his status as a go-to influencer for the party.
Sisson doesn’t call himself a journalist but  appreciates the Biden White House inviting creators to policy briefings  on Ukraine and infrastructure  in which the president made a surprise appearance in 2022.
Sisson wants more access for influencers and has little concern that Biden has given fewer interviews than other presidents with traditional news outlets.
“Folks at the New York Times just have to come to the realization that they are no longer the No. 1 priority,” he said in an interview. “Now, it’s a question of, ‘What is the best way we get this message out,’ and that way is not always the New York Times anymore.”
The 21-year-old New York University senior flew to Racine, Wis., to ask Biden two flattering questions before a campaign event  this month as the president was about to get on stage to announce a Microsoft data center.
“You make the job really easy because you do a lot of good stuff, and the other guy, like, really sucks,” Sisson told Biden in one short clip of their meeting that he posted that shows  them complimenting each other as they shake hands.

California consumer group blasts insurance bill backed by Newsom,https://www.latimes.com/business/story/2024-05-29/consumer-group-blasts-insurance-bill-backed-by-gov-newsom,2024-05-29,"A bill backed by Gov. Gavin Newsom that is intended to halt more exits from California’s troubled homeowners insurance market by speeding up reviews of  proposed rate hikes drew sharp criticism Wednesday from an influential consumer group.
The administration this week released the draft of a bill Newsomproposed this monththat he said would limit the review process of proposed rate hikes to 60 days.  But the draft allows the Department of Insurance to seek 30-day extensions beyond the two-month period as long as regulators publicly disclose what is slowing the review — immediately setting off a dispute about its possible implications.
Business
Major insurers have pulled back from California’s homeowners market, citing wildfires, inflation and other challenges. But there are steps at-risk homeowners can take now to secure coverage and at lower prices.
Consumer Watchdog maintains that the draft “guts” the process that allows consumers to intervene in reviews of both small and large rate hike requests, which are treated separately under the landmark 1988 measure known as Proposition 103. That measure gave an elected insurance commissioner the authority to review and approve insurer rate hikes.
“The governor’s plan invites insurance companies to set their own prices and will kill public participation in rate review,” said Consumer Watchdog Executive Director Carmen Balber, who added that the group would lobby to have the language changed in the Legislature. “It is a serious blow to all rate reviews in California.”
The governor’s office released a statement that the bill “makes no changes to the rules in Prop. 103 for how much an insurance company can charge, which continues to be that rates cannot be “excessive, inadequate, or unfairly discriminatory.”
The governor’s proposal augments Insurance Commissioner Ricardo Lara’sSustainable Insurance Strategy, a set of comprehensive regulations intended to stabilize rates and make it more attractive for insurers to write homeowners policies, especially in wildfire-prone areas such as hillsides and canyons.
However, the reform plan isn’t expected to be adopted until later in the year. Lara issued a statement this week that under Newsom’s bill his department “will continue to thoroughly review each and every rate application filed to make sure that they are compliant with our laws and justified under Prop. 103 and that consumers are protected.”
Consumer Watchdog’s posture threatens to bog down a bill that Newsom wants to push through the Legislature as part of the process for adopting the state budget. California’s Constitution requires the spending document to be enacted by June 15, though so-called “trailer bills” such as the insurance proposal can be enacted later. Newsom is seeking to speed adoption amid a wave of insurer pullbacks from the market, including State Farm’s decisionnot to renew 72,000 policies.
Balber criticized the language that specifies how the insurance department can seek more time to review proposed rate hikes that are less than 7%. Although regulators would be required to disclose what “unresolved” issues are slowing the review, the bill does not require the department to disclose concerns by “intervenors” such as Consumer Watchdog, which she said could result in their concerns being overlooked.
Balber  also said  that the draft law would allow insurers denied rate hikes that top 7% to immediately seek smaller rate hikes under the weaker review process, without separately filing for a smaller rate hike. That would make it easier for them to avoid hearings before administrative law judges where it might be decided an insurer should actually decrease it rates.
“It really opens the door to  companies manipulating the process to avoid a hearing,” she said.
The Personal Insurance Federation of California, a trade group of property and casualty insurers, said in a statement that the bill “provides more clarity and accountability to all parties involved in the process. This is a far better option than the current rules that resulted in an insurance crisis for many Californians.”
Rex Frazier, president of the federation, disputed Balber’s  criticism of the legislation, contending that Consumer Watchdog was seeking “special treatment” in the bill, while also bemoaning that insurers might be encouraged to seek smaller rate hikes if their larger ones are blocked. “The irony is thick here,” he said.
Not all consumer groups have the same view of the legislation.
Amy Bach, executive director of United Policyholders in San Francisco, said she viewed the bill as an effort by the governor to “turn up the heat” on all parties involved in the rate-review process, including the Department of Finance, as insurer pullbacks  force more homeowners into the FAIR Plan, the state’s insurer of last resort.
She said Consumer Watchdog’s criticism also assumes the insurance department “isn’t doing its job” in preventing rate hikes, which she wasn’t “prepared to agree with.”

Evacuation orders lifted for some Arizona residents forced from their homes by a wildfire,https://www.latimes.com/world-nation/story/2024-06-30/evacuation-orders-lifted-for-some-arizona-residents-forced-from-their-homes-days-ago-by-a-wildfire,2024-06-30,"SCOTTSDALE, Ariz. —Evacuation orders in Arizona have been lifted for some residents of northeast Scottsdale, days after they were forced from their homes by a wildfire, authorities said Sunday.
The Boulder View fire was 19% contained Sunday after charring nearly six square miles on the cusp of the Boulder Heights subdivision since Thursday.
About 60 homes were evacuated Friday. No injuries have been reported and no structures have been damaged.
Authorities said the cause of the fire remains under investigation. It began about five miles outside northern Scottsdale on the edge of the Tonto National Forest.
Maricopa County Department of Emergency Management officials said evacuations were lowered from “Go” to “Set” status Saturday evening for some displaced residents preparing to return home.
Scottsdale officials have notified homeowners that the north part of the McDowell Sonoran Preserve, including all trails, will be closed until further notice. They called that a precautionary move and said there was no immediate threat to the preserve.
Tiffany Davila, a spokesperson for the Arizona Department of Forestry and Fire Management, said nearly 270 firefighters were battling the wildfire in triple-digit heat Sunday.
She said there was a chance of thunderstorms in the fire area Sunday evening and that could make firefighting efforts more complicated due to gusty winds and lightning strikes.

LAUSD is exempt from stormwater regulations. Environmentalists say that needs to change,https://www.latimes.com/environment/story/2024-06-30/los-angeles-schools-are-exempt-from-stormwater-regulations,2024-06-30,"As California looks to improve its ability tocapture and store stormwater throughout the state, there is at least one sizable public landowner that is exempt from such efforts: The Los Angeles Unified School District.
One of the largest real estate holders in the Greater L.A. area, the school district owns  more than 3,200 parcels of land that occupy more than 10 square miles combined — an area almost twice the size of Beverly Hills.
Now, environmental groups are urging state water regulators to include the district’s  K-12 campuses in updated stormwater regulations, saying that LAUSD could make a considerable contribution to reducing pollution and enhancing water supplies in the region.
“Schools have been unregulated for runoff pollution for far too long,” a coalition of local groups wrote in a recentletter to the State Water Resources Control Board. The groups include the Los Angeles Waterkeeper, Heal the Bay, the Nature Conservancy, the Natural Resources Defense Council and others.
Aggressive and impactful reporting on climate change, the environment, health and science.
They noted that it’s been about a decade since the board last updated its stormwater regulations, known asMS4 permits. The board is now drafting an update to the rules, and the coalition says it is imperative that campuses be included.
“Once again, exempting K-12 schools from the [permit] will allow the wholly inadequate regulation of runoff from schools to continue for years more, and this lack of regulation will not provide the needed pressure to bring school districts like LAUSD to the table to pursue green stormwater projects in a significant and meaningful way,” the letter said.
According to the coalition, more than 580 miles of rivers, streams and shorelines throughout the region are impaired by one or more pollutants — as are 99% of enclosed waterways and wetlands — and urban and stormwater runoff is the largest source of those contaminants.
What’s more, many school campuses are home toconsiderable amounts of asphaltand other impervious surfaces that not only block stormwater from seeping into the ground and funnel contaminants into the watershed, but also contribute tohotter temperaturesfor students and their surrounding neighbors.
“Schools do not have to worry about what comes off their facilities,” said Bruce Reznik, executive director of the Los Angeles Waterkeeper. Candy wrappers, chip bags and other refuse regularly wind up in the watershed, as do pesticides and herbicides from lawns and horticulture programs. Copper, zinc, grease and other discharge from cars in school parking lots flow into the watershed as well, he said.
“They don’t have to worry about it at all, and so it doesn’t put the pressure on them to try to do more greening,” Reznik said. Los Angeles already has fairly robust stormwater regulations for most other sectors, so schools are “really the only game changer left,” he added.
Children shouldn’t be forced to learn and play in hot, asphalt-covered, fenced-in campuses, especially in neighborhoods that already lack park space.
But LAUSD officials said their exemption from state regulations does not equate to inaction.
The district complies with the state’sstormwater pollution prevention planand has developed internal guidelines for new facilities and redevelopment projects, according to Christos Chrysiliou, LAUSD’s chief eco-sustainability officer. The district has also drafted a stormwater whitepaper and technical manual, and passed a 2022 resolution toincrease green space on campuses by 30%by 2035.
“We do care about the environment and the students and staff that we serve, so we always try to not just do what’s required, but try to do the best that we can for the environment,” Chrysiliou said. At the same time, “we believe that this is an ongoing and future commitment that can be effectively carried out by the school district by means other than through coverage under the MS4 permit,” he said.
Complying with the permit regulations would eat up additional costs and resources and create undue hardship for the district, he said. For example, the regulations would require them to track and submit data following every rain event.
“We’re already complying with the spirit of the [permit], and adding additional paperwork definitely will take resources and staff from other plans that we have,” he said.
Climate & Environment
When it comes to stormwater capture, California stands out for “untapped potential,” according to the Pacific Institute.
Officials with the state water board said K-12 schools have not traditionally been included in the stormwater regulations because it’s not required by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, which oversees theNational Pollutant Discharge Elimination Systemprogram.
“The Water Boards are working with state and local officials and interested parties to better understand the potential costs and logistical challenges of including schools in any updated regulations,” agency officials said in a statement. “This is necessary before we can consider an update to the regulations.”
The board is supposed to revisit the MS4 permits every five years, but the update will represent the first in about a decade. They hope to release an informal draft permit this summer or fall, which will be subject to stakeholder feedback.
“While it is true that large, impervious surfaces (like those found at some schools) represent an opportunity to green communities and reduce stormwater pollution, there are logistical and financial challenges to evaluate before the board can consider including schools in a future permit,” the agency said. “The Water Boards are meeting with state and local officials and other interested parties to learn about these factors.”
Advocates acknowledged that many schools are already stretched for funding, and that having to design, implement and run a stormwater program could be a heavy lift. However, there are ample programs and funding sources available to help with such endeavors, including theSafe Clean Water Program, passed by L.A. County voters as Measure W in 2018, which allocates $280 million annually to stormwater capture programs, the coalition’s letter says.
Climate & Environment
L.A. County has captured enough stormwater to supply an estimated 2.4 million people for a year. Officials say they plan to capture more runoff in the future.
Part of the problem with exempting school districts from the permits is that it makes it difficult to know exactly how much runoff pollution is coming from campuses throughout the county, the letter says.
But Chrysiliou said LAUSD recentlydeveloped a databasethat tracks stormwater device locations so that they can be properly maintained. The devices include filtration tanks, bioswales (depressions or trenches that channel runoff) and permeable pavement installations at more than 120 schools.
He pointed to recent stormwater projects atNorthridge Middle SchoolandDaniel Webster Middle Schoolin Sawtelle as examples of such work. Both campuses installed bioswales, rain gardens and permeable paving in recent years.
Reznik acknowledged that such efforts can help, but said they should be district-wide and not piecemeal.
Benefits of the work go far beyond water quality and supplies, he argued. Studies have shown that removing pavement and installing green space can mitigate the impacts of extreme heat and improve overall student performance and physical and mental health, he said.
“I don’t want to make the schools the villains. They’re out there trying to educate students, they do always have budget shortfalls, it’s hard to maintain facilities, and now we’re adding this new thing,” said Reznik of Los Angeles Waterkeeper.  “But it’s just too … important for the region — and for the students — to be at the status quo that we’re at now.”

Arizona wildfire advances after forcing evacuations near Phoenix,https://www.latimes.com/world-nation/story/2024-06-29/arizona-wildfire-advances-after-forcing-evacuations-near-phoenix,2024-06-29,"SCOTTSDALE, Ariz. —More than 200 firefighters were battling a wildfire northeast of Phoenix on Saturday that threatened scores of homes and has forced dozens of residents to evacuate.
No structures have been damaged as the wildfire traversed nearly six square miles on the cusp of the Boulder Heights subdivision, said Matthew Wilcox, spokesman for a multi-agency wildfire response team.
There were 275 people combating the fire Saturday as temperatures topped 100 degrees before midday, with wind gusts expected.
Climate & Environment
Fire weather days have increased in Western U.S. over the last 50 years, with some of the largest jumps in California, according to a new report by Climate Central, a nonprofit news outlet that reports on climate change.
“We still have unseasonably high humidity, hot weather,” Wilcox said. “We have no wind right now, but gusts were predicted.”
Air tankers and helicopters have helped douse flames from the  Boulder View fire. The cause of the blaze is under investigation. It began about five miles east of Carefree, just outside northern Scottsdale on the edge of the Tonto National Forest.
The Red Cross set up an evacuation center at a high school in Scottsdale, and shelters for horses and other large animals were established at several locations, including a rodeo grounds.
Several fires were also burning inCaliforniaand Oregon.

California wildfires burned almost 90,000 acres already this year, an amount more than five times the average of pre-summer blazes from the last few years.

"Beavers, back on tribal land after 100 years, could aid California’s fragile ecosystem",https://www.latimes.com/environment/story/2024-06-28/beavers-reintroduced-california-reservation,2024-06-28,"Beavers are precious to the Tule River Indian Tribe. They are woven into the California tribe’s stories and appear in ancient pictographs painted by ancestors on the walls of a rock shelter in the Sierra Nevada Mountains.
But when nine of the furry rodents recently slid out of crates and slipped into waterways on the Tule River Reservation, they returned to a habitat where they hadn’t been seen in nearly a century.
A family of beavers — three adults, one subadult and three babies, known as “kits” — were released into the South Fork Tule River watershed on June 12, the California Department of Fish and Wildlife said. Two other beavers were released into Miner Creek on June 17.
As part of CDFW’s Beaver Restoration Program, beavers are back at work on the Tule River Indian Reservation. The beavers released on the Tule River watershed are expected to build dams that slow the flow of water and in turn create drought and wildfire resilience.pic.twitter.com/zcBbfzbeUc
The department conducted the releases in the foothills of the southern Sierra in partnership with the tribe, whose 55,356-acre reservation is based in Porterville, Calif., in Tulare County.
Beavers were a common sight in parts of the Sierra before the arrival of Europeans, but by the 20th century, their numbers had been decimated by fur trappers and eradication efforts.
A decade ago, tribal leaders called for the animals to be returned, driven by traditional Indigenous knowledge about beavers’ importance to the ecosystem — and inspired by the 500-to-1,000-year-old beaver images left at the Yokuts village site known as Painted Rock.
In 2022, the Fish and Wildlife Department received state funding to start a restoration program to prepare sites in California for the semiaquatic animals.
Beavers aid the environment by building dams that help to keep landscapes well-hydrated and more resilient in droughts and wildfires. That enhanced water retention could also protect the Tule River Indian Tribe’s drinking water supply — 80% of which comes from the river’s watershed, Fish and Wildlife said.
Climate & Environment
Beavers create unburned islands where plants and animals can shelter from megafires, research has confirmed. A movement is afoot to reintroduce the rodents to the state’s waterways.
“We’ve been through numerous droughts over the years — we were wondering how we can conserve, save water, get water here on our lands,” said Kenneth McDarment, a Tule River Tribe member and former tribal councilman, in a Fish and Wildlife statement. “The answer was in our pictographs.”
California Natural Resources Secretary Wade Crowfoot said the beaver program was the result of an unprecedented effort by the state to not only steward the environment but also support tribal sovereignty.
Elders from the Tachi Yokut and Tubatulabal tribes joined an elder from the Tule River Indian Tribe in a blessing ceremony to ready the habitat for the beavers’ arrival in June.
In video captured by the Fish and Wildlife Department, some of the beavers, which were brought in from state-owned land in Merced County, can be seen checking out their new digs in the 6,000-foot-elevation Sierra meadowland.
The slicked-back fur on the beavers’ heads and backs glistens in the sun as the agile swimmers slice the murky waters past submerged evergreen leaves, drifting twigs and shrubs. Possible construction materials?
Beavers released last fall by Fish and Wildlife in partnership with the Indigenous-led Maidu Summit Consortium in Plumas County wasted no time building lodges to live in and dams to protect themselves from predators and to store food, a department spokeswoman said. Today those structures, in the tribal community known as Tásmam Koyóm, are large and well-developed.
Fish and Wildlife officials intend to release more beavers into the Tule River watershed in the coming months and years.
“Our past is one where we treated these animals and others as varmints, and our culture over time ran them off the landscape,” said Charlton H. Bonham, department director. “That can’t be our future.”
Climate & Environment
Ancestral lands will be returned to the Shasta Indian Nation as part of a massive Klamath River dam removal project.

"Heat wave, thunderstorms to raise the risk of wildfires in California",https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2024-07-31/heat-wave-thunderstorms-to-raise-risk-of-wildfires-in-california,2024-07-31,"Another heat wave and more monsoonal thunderstorms are expected to increase wildfire danger in California over the weekend and into next week.
A high-pressure system is expected to expand over the western United States on Wednesday and get stronger through Friday, according to the National Weather Service. California will be spared the worst of the heat, the weather service predicted, as the system concentrates over the Rocky Mountains.
Temperatures could approach 100 degrees in Woodland Hills on Friday and 105 on Saturday or Sunday, said Mike Wofford, a NWS meteorologist in the Oxnard office. The Antelope Valley could see temperatures between 105 and 110.
“It’s gonna be a long trend but slow,” Wofford said. “It’ll be one to two degrees of warming each day.”
Climate change is transforming the character of the West’s hottest periods — making them more frequent, more persistent, more humid and more lethal. Greenhouse gas emissions from the burning of fossil fuelsalso play a role, not only by fueling higher air temperatures but also by warming ocean water.•How climate change is affecting heat waves in the West »•How to protect yourself and your loved ones from extreme heat »•As heat waves intensify, access to air conditioning can mean life or death »•More climate and environment coverage »
The weather service has recommended that people stay hydrated, take breaks in the shade and limit strenuous outdoor activities. People should also check up on the sick, elderly and those without air conditioning. Children and pets should never be left unattended in vehicles.
Monsoonal thunderstorms could develop Thursday night into Friday across metro areas from L.A. all the way into Santa Barbara, the weather service said. Mountain areas can expect to see thunderstorms in the afternoon to early evening on Friday and Saturday.
Most areas across the L.A. region won’t see rain, but some isolated areas could get a tenth to a few hundredths of an inch. “A lot of it is going to evaporate before it reaches the ground, so it’s going to be all over the map,” Wofford said.
Climate & Environment
California wildfires burned almost 90,000 acres already this year, an amount more than five times the average of pre-summer blazes from the last few years.
The weather service is expected to issue a fire weather watch — meaning that there is a high chance for extreme wildfire danger in the next 48 hours — for the mountain areas of the Santa Clarita Valley, Wofford said. Those are the driest areas with the greatest potential for fires as a result of dry lightning strikes.
“You just have to stay indoors,” Wofford added. “You can’t really do much about that. We’re not expecting a lot of rain falling, so when the lightning strikes on dry grass, it could spark a fire.”

"California wildfires off to explosive start, burning 30 times as many acres as all of last year",https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2024-07-31/california-wildfires-have-burned-750-000-acres-so-far-this-year,2024-07-31,"Summer isn’t even half over in California, and wildfires have already scorched more than  763,000 acres, straining firefighting resources, forcing evacuations and destroying homes.
The total dwarfs the average amount burned over the last five years. As of Wednesday morning, 4,665 fires have charred through more than a dozen counties spanning from Siskiyou to San Diego.
The most recent, theNixon firein Riverside County, continues to burn out of control. As of Wednesday morning, it was only 5% contained, according to the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection.
Last year’s wildfire season was unusually tame, but there were still 3,746 infernos that burned 25,932 acres — an area nearly the size of San Francisco. In 2022, 7,477 wildfires burned 331,358 acres, according to Cal Fire data.
The Park fire — which started a week ago in Butte County and has spread to Plumas, Shasta and Tehama counties — is by itself larger than all the fires in 2022. The fifth-largest wildfire in the state’s history, it has scorched almost 390,000 acres and remains only 18% contained, Cal Fire reported Wednesday.
The 763,425 acres that have burned this year amount to a land mass nearly the size of Rhode Island and mark a 2,816% increase from all of 2023. The fires have destroyed 559 homes and commercial buildings and claimed one life, according to Cal Fire data.

“The numbers are a stark reminder: 95% of wildfires are caused by humans,” Cal Fire wrote in a post on the social media platform X. “Stay vigilant ... Let’s prevent fires from accidental sparks like dragging trailer chains or improper campfires. One less spark means one less wildfire.”
Firefighters across the state are working hard to address intense fire conditions, which have become familiar during the hot summer months, Gov. Gavin Newsom said during a news conference in Kern County on Tuesday.
Two wet winters back to back fed grasses and other vegetation that then dried out during intense heat waves this summer. Those bone-dry grasses are fodder for explosive wildfire growth when paired with above-average temperatures and strong winds.
Climate & Environment
Experts say two consecutive wet winters and forecasts for a warmer-than-normal summer will likely contribute to a ‘very active’ fire season later this fall.
In Kern County, the Borel fire has scorched more than 57,000 acres and leveled the tiny, historic mining town ofHavilahsince it ignited last week. It is 17% contained, according to Cal Fire.
The Borel is one of three that have burned almost 90,000 acres in Kern and Tulare counties since mid-July. Collectively, Cal Fire said, the fires are 34% contained.
Six other wildfires that started in the last two weeks and burned more than 200 acres are still active in California, according to Cal Fire. They are:
“It’s remarkable that we’re seeing so many of these iconic places in California that are being quite literally devastated,” Newsom said.
Experts have warned Californians to brace for anactive wildfire seasonthrough the fall.
The Southern California coast — including Los Angeles, Orange and San Diego counties and part of the Central Coast — could see large fire potential from September through November, according toCal Fire forecasters.

L.A. consumer group calls FAIR Plan insurance reforms an industry ‘bailout’,https://www.latimes.com/business/story/2024-07-30/fair-plan-reform-homeowners-insurance-ricardo-lara-consumer-watchdog,2024-08-01,"A new law that could force homeowners across California to cover billions of dollars of insurer losses caused by a catastrophic wildfire is generating pushback from a leading consumer group, which has called it an industry “bailout.”
State Insurance Commissioner Ricardo Lara announced Friday he had reached an agreement with the California FAIR Plan that would allow losses suffered by the state’s insurer of last resort to be recouped by surcharges on residential and commercial insurance policies statewide in an “extreme worst case scenario.”
The FAIR Plan, which insures property owners who cannot get or afford traditional policies, is backed by licensed  insurers such as State Farm and Allstate. As the program is structured, they are on the hook to pay claims if the FAIR Plan runs through its reserves, reinsurance and  catastrophe bonds.
Business
Major insurers have pulled back from California’s homeowners market, citing wildfires, inflation and other challenges. But there are steps at-risk homeowners can take now to secure coverage and at lower prices.
Under Lara’s agreement, if that happens the insurers would be required to cover up to $2 billion in FAIR Plan claims — $1 billion for residential and $1 billion for commercial claims. They could then temporarily surcharge their own policyholders for half of what they are assessed with the approval of the insurance commissioner.
Homeowners would not be surcharged for commercial losses — only holders of commercial policies would be. The agreement also allows insurers to temporarily surcharge policyholders for 100% of claims in excess of those amounts with the approval of the insurance commissioner.
“It’s outrageous and outside the law for the insurance commissioner to force consumers to bail out home insurance companies and then call that consumer protection,” said Carmen Balber, executive director of Los Angeles-basedConsumer Watchdog.
Gabriel Sanchez, Lara’s press secretary, defended the agreement, saying, “It would be easy to listen to the elites and the entrenched interests defending a system that clearly isn’t working. Commissioner Lara is focused on hearing from the public, following the data and creating realistic, long-lasting solutions for everyone in this state.”
TheFAIR Plan assessmentis the latest element of Lara’sSustainable Insurance Strategy,a package of executive actions intended to stabilize the California market, which has seen insurers stop writing new policies and decline to renew existing policies amid a sharp increase in claims for wildfires damage.
Just this week, firefighters are battling the massive Park fire in Butte, Tehama and Shasta counties, where 100 structures have been destroyed, 4,200 were threatened and 26,000 people were forced to evacuate as of Monday. It is thesixth-largest firein state history.
Business
The insurance industry will soon have the ability to use wildfire models when setting rates. Homeowners in high risk areas already know how these models have made policies hard to get and hard to afford.
As insurers have pulled back from high-fire risk neighborhoods, the number of residential FAIR Plan policies hasmore than doubledsince 2019 to about 408,000 as of June. Commercial policies similarly increased to 11,026.
The FAIR Plan has a market share under 4%. Policyholders are concentrated in canyons, hillsides and other high-risk neighborhoods,  vulnerable to fire and catastrophic insurance losses. The plan’sloss exposurewas $393 billion  as of June, even though the plan’s policies are more limited than those available through the regular commercial market.
Lara said Friday in a release announcing the agreement that “modernizing the FAIR Plan is a crucial step in our strategy to stabilize California’s insurance market.”
The FAIR Plan’s financial risk is overwhelmingly due to its residential policies, which account for about 95% of its $393 billion in total loss exposure, according to the insurer.
The  Insurance Department downplayed a worst-case scenario, noting that even the 2018 Camp fire in Butte County that ravaged the town of Paradise, destroying or damaging more than 19,000 structures and causing some$16.5 billion in damage, did not deplete  the FAIR Plan’s  reserves.
The Insurance Department contended that the agreement was actually favorable to consumers because under current law there is nothing prohibiting the insurers from seeking policyholder assessments on all FAIR Plan losses they must cover.
“The agreement ... requires insurance companies to share the burden, something not clearly outlined before. That protects consumers by providing predictability which leads to stability,” Sanchez said.
Balber disputed that reading of the law and said Lara has not been able to get legislative authority for the insurer policyholder assessments, so he proceeded under questionable executive authority. “We have several questions about the legality of this proposal and are looking into it,” she said.
Consumer Watchdog has called for requiring insurers to offer policies in wildfire-prone neighborhoods to homeowners who have taken steps to reduce fire risks on their property as the best method to reduce enrollment in the FAIR Plan and stabilize the state’s insurance market.
Another key element of Lara’s FAIR Plan reforms call for the insurer to offer greater commercial coverage — up to $20 million per structure and $100 million for any one location.
Dan Dunmoyer, chief executive of the California Building Industry Assn., said the trade group has been seeking higher commercial coverage limits due to the rise of insurance premiums, which have slowed the construction of condominium complexes that builders insure.
He estimated that astronomical insurance rate increases have slowed condo construction by about 70% in the last 12 months, with fewer than 6,000 units built.
“Our view on this is: Get some competition in the marketplace, expand commercial coverage, let us build the most affordable for sale homes in California, which are condos,” he said.
The American Property Casualty Insurance Assn., an industry trade group, called Lara’s plan “an important step toward restoring the FAIR Plan’s financial stability and ensuring consumers have access to the coverage they need.”
The deal reached by Lara with the FAIR Plan is a binding legal stipulation and it requires the insurer to develop a “Plan of Operation” within 30 days detailing how it will carry out the agreement. It has 120 days to submit a rate plan for offering the higher commercial coverage.
The FAIR Planwas sued last weekby four California residents who claim its policies offer subpar coverage for fire and smoke damage. The proposed class-action lawsuit seeks to represent more than 300,000 of the plan’s residential policyholders. The plan also is facing a lawsuit from more than 1,000 homeowners in Los Angeles who say the plan wrongly denied their claims.

Residents flee as Nixon fire in southern Riverside County spreads rapidly,https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2024-07-30/nixon-fire-rapidly-grows-in-riverside-county,2024-07-31,"The Nixon fire near Aguanga in southern Riverside County exploded in size after it ignited Monday afternoon, growing to almost 5,000 acres by Tuesday night, according to theCalifornia Department of Forestry and Fire Protection.
Photos and video from the scene showed some buildings destroyed by flames and others on fire. Cal Fire said Tuesday night that one structure had been destroyed and four damaged. It wasn’t immediately clear how many of the structures were homes. About 2,000 buildings were underevacuation orders and warnings,according to Cal Fire.
Firefighters responded to calls around 12:30 p.m. Monday about the blaze near Richard Nixon Boulevard in Aguanga, a largely rural community not far from Palomar Mountain and Riverside County’s border with San Diego County.
Within a few hours, the fire saw explosive growth, hitting 1,000 acres by 5 p.m. before almost tripling in size by 8 p.m., according to Cal Fire.
California
The Park fire’s growth amid steady winds and hot temperatures has been dramatic. It is the seventh-largest wildfire in California history and still growing.
It had swelled to 4,941 acres as of Tuesday night with no containment. The cause of the fire remains under investigation.
The Nixon fire is just one of several burning across California.
Gov. Gavin Newsom on Tuesday signed an emergency proclamation in Kern County because of theBorel fire, which has continued to expand in and around Sequoia National Forest. That blaze had grown to 57,306 acres Tuesday evening, according to federal officials. It was 17% contained.
“We’re seeing significantly more intense activity” in fires across the state, Newsom said Tuesday. Roughly 750,000 acres have burned this season,a significant increasefrom the state’s five-year average of 140,000 acres, Newsom said.
“It’s not just August, September and October,” he said, “but likely November-December that we’ll be fighting the ferocity of Mother Nature and these fires.”
Themassive Park fireburning in Butte and Tehama counties, which has become the state’s fifth-largest in recorded history, continued to grow overnight, hitting 386,764 acres as of Tuesday night, with 18% containment.
The perimeter of the blaze is 260 miles, more than three times the surface area of Lake Tahoe, according to Cal Fire. Crews fighting to slow the fire’s spread have been challenged by strong winds, high temperatures and extremely dry fuel beds.
The fire has forced more than 26,000 people across Butte, Tehama and Shasta counties to flee their homes. More than 300 structures have been damaged or destroyed, fire officials said.
Residents who have been forced to evacuate could get somehelp covering relocation costsfrom their homeowners or renters insurance, according to state Insurance Commissioner Ricardo Lara. These policies typically cover food and housing costs, furniture rental, relocation and storage fees and extra transportation expenses.
California
A wildfire burning northeast of Chico has swelled to more than 164,000 acres, sending thousands of residents fleeing in the night.
Ronnie Dean Stout II, 42, who is accused of starting the Park fire by pushing his flaming car down an embankment in upper Bidwell Park in Chico, was denied bail Monday by a Superior Court judge in Oroville.
Stout has denied that he intentionally started the fire and told officials that he did not push the car down the hill.
Butte County Dist. Atty. Mike Ramsey said prosecutors are not alleging that Stout purposely started the blaze but that he helped the inferno spread once his car — stuck in an area of dry grasses — caught fire. Prosecutors argue that Stout, whom they accuse of being intoxicated at the time, walked away from the scene.
He “watched the fire develop under his car, then got in a position … to push the car backwards into that gully,” Ramsey alleged ata news conference Monday. “This didn’t have to happen.”
In Riverside County, crews fighting the Nixon fire faced another day of temperatures in the 90s and low humidity.

The fire is burning in thick chaparral that flourished during the rainy season but has since dried out, providing prime conditions for a fast-moving wildfire. Rob Roseen, a spokesperson for Cal Fire’s Riverside County unit, said the fuel load in the area is about double what is typical for this time of year.
Cal Fire said Tuesday night that 741 personnel were battling the blaze, both on the ground and from the air, using airplanes and helicopters.

"As massive Park fire marches into history books, firefighters face hurdles to slowing it down",https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2024-07-29/park-fire-is-californias-sixth-largest-blaze-in-history,2024-07-30,"As thePark firemarches into history books — becoming California’ssixth largeston record — experts say it still has much life left, with several challenges hindering efforts to combat the blaze as it continues to chew up remote wilderness at an astonishing clip.
Burning across mostly rural areas of Butte and Tehama counties, the Park fire surpassed 370,000 acres Monday, with a shift in weather forcing firefighters to react to new hot spots and unpredictable flare-ups.
“There’s more to be seen from this fire,” saidDon Hankins, a Chico State University professor of geography with expertise in pyrogeography and fire management. “As soon as those conditions change, [fire growth is] back on again.”
Almost 5,000 personnel were  responding to the wildfire, and they  were able to secure 12% containment as of Monday evening. Much of the fire’s future, however, rests with factors beyond human control: weather and terrain.
“I definitely see the potential for it to be a much larger fire,” said Hankins, whose family has been evacuated from their home in Forest Ranch, northeast of Chico. Their house hasn’t been damaged, he said, but he worries about what this fire could do — and where it could reach — if it continues to burn into the autumn months, which he said could happen unless there is a dramatic change in conditions. He noted it wasn’t until rain hit the deadly Camp fire in 2018 that it fizzled out.
“The topography and the landscape there makes it difficult [for firefighters] to work in,” Hankins said of the Park fire, which is burning throughout the rugged Ishi Wilderness.
After aweekend of lower temperatures and higher humidity, which aided fire suppression, increased heat and winds were starting to again fuel fire activity, officials said. Last week, the explosive wildfire more than doubled in size several times in a matter of hours and producedfire whirls, or “firenados,”as it grew.
The Park Fire has become the sixth-largest wildfire in California's history, affecting Butte, Tehama, Shasta, and Plumas counties. This realism underscores the urgent need for wildfire preparedness. Ensure your family's safety by signing up for emergency alerts and visiting…pic.twitter.com/DTweLgOGF4
“This fire is extremely unstable and unpredictable,” Tehama County Sheriff Dave Kain said at anews conferenceMonday. “We’ve seen many places we thought were going to be safe to move back into erupt in flames again.”
Officials continued to ask those who were evacuated to remain patient as crews worked to secure fire lines that would allow people to return home — “but only when safe,” Kain said.
“As the week progresses, temperatures are expected to rise,” said Sergio Arellano, a Park fire spokesperson.
Temperatures are forecast to reach 100 in Chico by Wednesday, rising to 106 by Sunday.
“It will make fire behavior ... increase due to the high heat — it’s going to dry out the fuels more — plus we’re expecting some light winds,” Arellano said.
“Wind is always our enemy,” he added. Winds, as well as thick smoke, can ground helicopters, which have become key in battling the flames throughout the remote terrain.
California
A perfect storm of hot, dry winds, untouched brush and remote topography has fueled explosive growth of the Park fire north of Chico, now over 350,000 acres.
The blaze ignited Wednesday afternoon in what authorities said was anact of arsonwhen a man pushed a burning car into a gully near Chico. The fire quickly ballooned into the state’slargest of the year.
The rate of growth slowed in recent days, declining to about 20,000 additional acres over 24 hours from Sunday to Monday, but many sections were still a major threat.
More than 26,000 people were ordered to evacuate across Butte, Tehama and Shasta counties, Arellano said Monday, and many more were under evacuation warnings, including in western Plumas County.
At least 109 structures have been destroyed and 4,200 are threatened, according to the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection. The fire’s northern and eastern boundaries remain major concerns, with flames jumping across Highways 32 and 36.
As the weather started to clear Sunday afternoon, it became hotter and drier, pushing the smoke and cloud cover away, Mark Bunton, the operations section chief for the Park fire’s unified command, said at a morning update.
“So it now allowed the fire to breathe,” Bunton said. “With that, we ended up with ... a number of areas that gave us challenges.”
He said some areas saw spot fires — blazes set off by sparks jumping beyond the fire’s perimeter — spread more than 100 acres, but crews were working to establish and hold containment lines, despite the challenging conditions. He said much of the fire’s western edge was almost impossible to reach with ground equipment, requiring “very laborious work and time-consuming” hand crews to lead the firefight.
Lassen Volcanic National Park, in southern Shasta County, was closed and evacuated, withpark officialsconcernedthe fire would reach its historic district and headquarters in Mineral, which escaped the wrath of the Dixie fire in 2021, the national park said in a statement. Its staff was assisting with evacuations and “scrambling to save historic artifacts stored in the 1927 Loomis Museum.”
California
The explosive Park fire north of Chico created massive smoke plumes that whirled up into the atmosphere, swirling in a tornado-like way, a phenomenon known as a “firenado.”
The Park fire was far from the only concern across California, with crews responding to more than22 wildfires statewide.
TheNixon fire in Riverside Countystarted Monday afternoon and was described as a fast-moving brush fire. By 10 p.m., the fire had exceeded 3,700 acres and was 0% contained. Mandatory evacuation orders were triggered.
TheBorel fire in Kern Countycontinued to burn in and around Sequoia National Forest, growing to 53,010 acres Monday morning,according to federal officials.
Already the blaze has left a path of destruction, with significant structure loss in the historic mining town of Havilah and concern about more damage, given the area’sred flag warning— an alert for dangerous fire weather — through Monday night. Several nearby communities were under evacuation orders and warnings, and much of the national forest and federal lands were closed.
“Moderate to rapid fire spread will continue to move to the east and north, potentially impacting structures and infrastructure in Bodfish, Moreland Mill, and French Meadow areas,” federal officials said in a Monday update. “Fire may exhibit very high rates of spread, high intensity and difficulty of control.”
The Borel fire is now being managed with two other fires in Kern and Tulare counties, previously referred to as the SQF Lightning incident. The others are the Trout fire, which has burned 23,369 acres and is 33% contained, and the Long fire, which has burned 9,204 acres and is 95% contained,according to federal officials.
“The summer is far from over, so staying prepared is crucial,” Cal Firewrote on social media. The historic nature of the Park fire “underscores the urgent need for wildfire preparedness. ... Have your go bag packed and know two evacuation routes. Stay informed by signing up for emergency alerts, stay prepared, and help protect our communities.”

The catalyst behind this year’s largest fire isa burning car that authorities said a Chico man pushed down a 60-foot embankment into a gullylast week.
The vehicle —  engulfed in flames — ended up in Chico’s Bidwell Park. The fire then quickly spread.
Authoritiesarrested the suspect, Ronnie Dean Stout II, the next day, Thursday.
Cal Fire reportsthat the blaze had scorched more than 350,000 acres across Northern California’s Butte and Tehama counties. It’s 10% contained.

The perfect storm of fires
Experts say the fire’s explosive growth is due to a perfect storm of hot, dry conditions, combustible vegetation and a landscape that hasn’t burned in decades. Combine those elements with the fire’s remote terrain, which has made it challenging for crews to gain access to the blaze’s swelling perimeter, and the firefight could be long and arduous.
“This is really the first fire in the past several years in California that I would call extraordinary — and that’s not a good thing,” Daniel Swain, a climate scientist with UCLA, said ina briefing.
On Thursday, footage captured by AlertCalifornia wildfire cameras appeared to show the blazespewing tornado-like vortices, sometimes referred to as fire whirls orfirenados.
“At this point the fire is kind of creating its own weather, and that can be pretty unpredictable,” said Courtney Carpenter, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service in Sacramento. “Really big, explosive wildfires can create thunderstorms; they can make whirling fire plumes that can mimic tornadoes.”
Swain said it is almost certain to become several times larger than it currently is, and will probably be a several-hundred-thousand-acre fire before it is contained.
Path of destruction
The fire’s rapid rate of spread has so far marched it north and east — stretching across northern Butte County and a growing portion of Tehama County — into a relatively remote mixture of grass, brush and timber and away from the threatened communities of Cohasset and Forest Ranch.
The fire, however, has already carved a path of destruction. Chief Garrett Sjolund, of Cal Fire’s  Butte County unit, said “numerous structures” have been burned, including 134 buildings destroyed and  4,000 under threat.
Officials are worried about the community of Cohasset, where they initially feared a repeat of the2018 Camp fire, which razed the nearby community of Paradise and killed 85 people — the deadliest wildfire on record in California. During that blaze, dozens of people were trapped on the area’s limited roadways while trying to escape.
About 4,000 residents have been evacuated from Cohasset, Forest Ranch and parts of northeast Chico, along with several rural areas in southern Tehama County.
The area was under ared flag warning,signaling dangerous weather that supports rapid fire grow, both Thursday and Friday.
That pattern has pushed flames into wilderness that has been untouched by fire for decades, if not longer — making it ripe with thicker vegetation and dead and dying brush, which ignites easily and fast.
Residents from the Chico area are watching the Park fire’s movements with anxiety.
“It’s been a pretty restless time for us,” said Don Hankins, a professor of geography and planning at Chico State, who is also on the Butte County Fire Safe Council.
What’s the outlook?
The days and weeks ahead are likely to see more acreage added to the fire as crews contend with rugged, volcanic topography and persistent hot and dry conditions.
“The outlook is that it’s not going to be easily contained,” Hankins said. “We’ve got a long season ahead of us before the rainy season comes, and that’s really going to be the ultimate thing to curtail any of these fires that are happening across the West right now.”

"Wildfire smoke increases dementia risk more than other forms of air pollution, landmark study finds",https://www.latimes.com/environment/story/2024-07-29/study-wildfire-smoke-raises-dementia-risk-more-than-other-pollutants,2024-07-29,"Exposure to wildfire smoke increases the odds of being diagnosed with dementia even more than exposure to other forms of air pollution, according to a landmark study of more than 1.2 million Californians. The study — released Monday  at the Alzheimer’s Assn. International Conference in Philadelphia — is the largest and most comprehensive review of the impact of wildfire smoke on brain health to date, according to its authors.
“I was expecting for us to see an association between wildfire smoke exposure and dementia,” said study author Dr. Holly Elser, an epidemiologist and resident physician in neurology at the University of Pennsylvania. “But the fact we see so much stronger of an association for wildfire as compared to non-wildfire smoke exposure was kind of surprising.”
Aggressive and impactful reporting on climate change, the environment, health and science.
The findings have big health implications, particularly in Western states, where air pollution produced by wildfiresnow accounts for up to half of all fine-particle pollution— a figure that’s been trending upward as wildfires grow larger and more intensedue to climate changeandlegacies of fire suppression and industrial loggingthat havealtered the composition of many Western forests.
The researchers looked at a type of particulate-matter pollution called PM2.5. These particles are 30 times smaller than the width of a human hair — tiny enough to penetrate deeply into the lungs and cross over into the bloodstream, where they can cause inflammation. Exposure has been shown to raise the risk of dementia and a host of other conditions, including heart disease, asthma and low birth weight.
“We increasingly see that PM2.5 is tied to virtually every health outcome we look at,” said study author Joan Casey, associate professor of public health at the University of Washington.
Elser, Casey and fellow researchers analyzed the health records of more than 1.2 million Kaiser Permanente Southern California members 60 or older between 2009 and 2019. None had been diagnosed with dementia at the beginning of the study.
They estimated each person’s exposure to PM2.5 based on their census tract of residence and then separated that into wildfire and non-wildfire pollution using air quality monitoring data, satellite imagery and machine learning techniques.
They then looked at how many participants were eventually diagnosed with dementia. Unlike past studies, the researchers were able to determine this using patients’ full electronic health records, rather than relying on hospitalizations as a proxy for such diagnoses.
Looking at participants’ average wildfire PM2.5 exposure over three years, the researchers found a 21% increase in the odds of a dementia diagnosis for each increase of 1 microgram of particulate matter per cubic meter of air. When it came to non-wildfire PM 2.5 exposure, they documented a 3% increased risk of dementia diagnoses for each increase of 3 micrograms of particulate matter per cubic meter of air.
For the record:
10:31 a.m. July 29, 2024A previous version of this article included an outdated percentage increase, 23%, for the odds of a dementia diagnosis. The researchers have updated the finding to 21%.
“That’s what it comes down to, is what’s so different about wildfire smoke?” Casey said.

A prolonged heat wave across much of the western U.S. is challenging wildland firefighters, with an uptick in heat-related illnesses reported in California.
More research is needed to learn exactly what that is. Possibilities include the fact that wildfire particles are produced at higher temperatures, contain a greater concentration of toxic chemicals and are, on average, smaller than PM2.5 from other sources.
These ultrafine particles can translocate from people’s noses into their brains via the olfactory bulb, Casey said.
“Normally the brain is protected by the blood-brain barrier, but here there’s actually a direct route for ultrafine particles to get into the brain and possibly cause some of the problems that we’re seeing in folks living with dementia,” she said.
The way in which people are exposed to wildfire smoke also differs from other types of fine-particle pollution, the researchers said. Background or ambient fine-particle pollution levels are usually relatively constant in a given place over time. But wildfire particulate matter tends to fluctuate wildly, resulting in more exposure over shorter periods of time, which may overwhelm the body’s defenses.
Of some 5,500 abstracts submitted to the Alzheimer’s Assn. International Conference, this one stood out due to its novelty, importance and impact, said Dr. Claire Sexton, senior director of scientific programs and outreach for the Alzheimer’s Assn.
“There have been other studies looking at different types of pollution, but this was unique in terms of the extent and the way in which it was able to do these analyses,” she said.
The researchers found the effects to be stronger on Asian, Black and Latino people, as well as those living in high-poverty areas. The most heavily impacted group was one that researchers classified as “other” because it didn’t contain enough people to differentiate further, Casey said. That group included Indigenous people, Pacific Islanders and people whose race was unknown.
“So these disparities are playing out again, as we unfortunately often see with environmental exposures,” she said. “But the level at which we observed it here was fairly striking.”
Casey believes those disparities are due to differential exposure based on where populations are located, noting that her previous research has shown that Indigenous people in Californiahave by far the highest levels of wildfire particulate exposure. Other factors could include poorer housing quality, lack of access to air filtration devices, jobs that prevent people from staying indoors during wildfire events and disparate responses to the same amount of pollution due to preexisting hypertension or diabetes, she said.
“All those things are driven by social determinants of health,” she said. “The fact that we need to allocate additional resources to these people and places to protect health and to try to reduce health disparities going forward is really important.”
The researchers did not differentiate between dementia subtypes like Alzheimer’s, the most common form, because they relied on diagnostic codes rather than using brain imaging or postmortem studies. That’s important to know — and a key area for future study — because in order to best protect people, clinicians need to have an understanding of what’s underpinning the relationship between wildfire smoke and different dementia subtypes, Elser said.
Climate & Environment
California’s prisons are uniquely unprepared for climate change because of remote locations, aging infrastructure and overcrowding, experts say.
Still, the study is notable for its massive sample size and careful approach, taking into account sociodemographics like comorbidities and census tract poverty, said Rachel Whitmer, the director of the UC Davis Alzheimer’s Disease Research Center who was not involved in the research.
The prevalence of dementia is on the rise as the baby boomer generation ages, but environmental factors may also be contributing to the increase, she said.
Research like this lays the groundwork for future studies, she said.
“With the increase in wildfires, this is a really important question and I think they did a really rigorous job in exploring it,” she said.
Levels of PM2.5 had been declining since the Clean Air Act took effect in 1970. But wildfires have reversed those trends in California,undercutting efforts to reduce emissions. In recent years, wildfire smoke has also affected the Midwest and East Coast. In 2023, smoke from Canadian wildfiresblanketed the Atlantic seaboard, triggering air quality alerts and forcing the cancellation of outdoor events.
“It’s a big problem in places where wildfires are endemic,” Elser said. “And I worry that as we continue to experience increasingly frequent wildfire events, this could affect more people over a larger geographical distribution, more of the time.”
Climate change is transforming the character of the West’s hottest periods — making them more frequent, more persistent, more humid and more lethal.

Newsom calls Legislature into special session after lawmakers reject his latest salvo at Big Oil,https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2024-08-31/newsom-california-energy-oil-lawmakers-special-session-2024,2024-09-01,"SACRAMENTO —Gov. Gavin Newsom called California lawmakers into a special session Saturday after Assembly Democrats pushed back on his request to approvenew requirements on oil refineriesin the final days of the regular legislative session that ended Saturday night.
The unusual maneuver effectively pushes the Legislature into overtime to address the complex and politically sensitive issue of energy affordability just as campaign season heats up in advance of the Nov. 5 election.
Newsom’s order called for  a special session to begin Saturday, but it’s unclear when lawmakers will hold hearings to consider the bills or whether they will pass. While the Assembly formally opened the special session Saturday night, the Senate defied Newsom and refused to. Lawmakers were scheduled to leave Sacramento this weekend for four months in their home districts.
Climate & Environment
Newsom energy package sparks tug of war in final hours of California legislative session.
“It should be common sense for gas refineries to plan ahead and backfill supplies when they go down for maintenance to avoid price spikes. But these price spikes are actually profit spikes for Big Oil, and they’re using the same old scare tactics to maintain the status quo,” Newsom said in a statement.
“Calling the session now allows the Legislature to begin that work immediately so that the state can resolve this important matter to establish the necessary rules to prevent price spikes next year and beyond.”
It’s the second time in two years that Newsom has called a special session focused on the economics of the oil industry, an issue that divides Democrats as they navigate a desire to fight climate change with ambitions to lower prices at the pump. Newsom has blamed high gas prices on the industry, which he accused of gouging consumers. Oil companies point to the state’s climate change and tax policies as drivers of higher prices.
Two weeks ago, Newsomannounced a proposalto require that petroleum refiners maintain a stable inventory in order to prevent fuel shortages and price spikes when refinery equipment is taken offline for maintenance.
As the oil industry lobbied heavily against the proposal, Democrats in the Assembly and Senate squabbled over how to move forward. Lawmakers said they were frustrated with Newsom’s attempt to push the plan through the Capitol at the last minute.
In a statement Friday, Assembly Speaker Robert Rivas (D-Hollister) said his caucus agreed with the governor about the need to urgently address affordability and would deliver results if a special session was called. But he refused to take up the bills for a floor vote by Saturday’s deadline.
“What I’m not going to do is push through bills that haven’t been sufficiently vetted with public hearings,” Rivas said. “Doing so could lead to unintended consequences on Californians’ pocketbooks.”
Late Saturday night, Rivas said he will begin organizing the Assembly for the special session and plans to announce more details in the next two weeks.
“We know that the number one issue facing this state is our cost of living, the high cost of living,” he said to reporters in the Capitol. “We have to stop at nothing to find solutions.”
The message was different on the other end of the Capitol, where Senate leader Mike McGuire (D-Healdsburg) told reporters that his chamber was prepared to pass Newsom’s oil proposal during the regular session but will not reconvene this fall.
“The Senate Democratic Caucus is 100% united that we’re not going to come back for a special session,” McGuire said.
“We had the votes. We were ready to pass the bills, get them across the finish line and to the governor.”
It was not immediately clear if the Senate leader has the legal authority to refuse the governor’s call for a special session or whether Newsom would try to force McGuire to acquiesce.
Newsom’s office began talking with the Senate and Assembly earlier this summer about legislation that would allow his administration to require that petroleum refiners maintain a stable inventory in order to prevent fuel shortages in California.
After gathering more insight about pricing fromlaws passed in a previous special session on oilthat ended last year, state regulators had reported that charges at the pump increase when the oil companies do not maintain enough refined gasoline to backfill production shortfalls or protect against the impact of unplanned maintenance.
Western States Petroleum Assn. leaders said the governor’s refinery proposal will drive up fuel costs in California and reduce supplies in Arizona and Nevada. The argument raised a potent political concern that the state policy could become a national headache for Vice President Kamala Harris and other Democrats in a critical election year.
“It’s noteworthy that legislators are considering such radical energy policies at a time when the nation is closely examining how the ‘California model’ will impact their families and pocketbooks,” Catherine Reheis-Boyd, CEO of the Western States Petroleum Assn.,said in a statement this week.
California
The policy trademark of California’s 40th governor is becoming increasingly apparent in his second term: publicly manufacture a sense of urgency.
The warning from the association, Chevron and other industry players spooked Assembly Democrats, who were also irked by the late introduction of the proposal.
In an effort to reach an agreement with Democratic lawmakers, theproposal was tied together with other billsin the Senate and Assembly during negotiations with leaders of both houses. But environmentalists opposed some of those proposals, leaving Democrats with a suite of bills that angered both ends of the environmental policy spectrum.
One of the Assembly bills — which would cut energy and climate programs that fund air-conditioning improvements in schools, installation of energy storage and generation technologies in vulnerable communities and solar energy systems on multifamily affordable housing to achieve a meager one-time customer credit on electricity and gas bills —drew sweeping opposition from a coalition of environmental, education, housing and energy groups. Another bill, which ratepayer advocates supported, would have required the Public Utilities Commission to develop a framework for analyzing total annual energy costs for residential households.
The bills didn’t offer enough incentive for Assembly Democrats to slam the plan through this week. They also soured on efforts by Senate leader McGuire to leverage the moment to pass Senate bills that would accelerate environmental reviews for clean energy and hydrogen projects, save ratepayers money by lowering requirements for utility wildfire mitigation plans and make it harder for companies to terminate utility service to customers.
California
Some Southern California consumers say they’re frustrated with their costly electricity bills. Here’s what to do about it.
The drama marked another effort by a governor on the cusp of the final two years of his second term to push last-minute bills through a Legislature guided by two new leaders. Earlier this summerlawmakers similarly balked on passing a billthat would have placed his measure targeting retail crime on the ballot.
Newsom’s decision to call for a special session marks the second time he’s sought to toughen California’s oil laws outside the typical two-year process to hear bills, which runs from January through August or mid-September each year.
The governorcalled a special session two years agoto penalize oil companies for excessive profits as gasoline prices spiked. But lawmakers were ultimatelyreluctant to adopt a penaltyand Newsom refined his request to instead demand more transparency from the industry.
Instead of enactinga cap and penalty on oil refinery profits, Newsom and lawmakers gave state regulators the ability to do so in the future. Consumer advocates and the governor celebrated the resulting law as a groundbreaking tool that could keep gas prices from escalating.
California
California Gov. Gavin Newsom launched an offensive in his war with Big Oil. The battle didn’t go as planned.
But Republican Gov. Joe Lombardo of Nevada joined the industry and his party in May when he sent Newsom a letter warning that a cap could “further raise gas prices for both of our constituencies” because his state’s gas largely comes from refineries in California.
On Friday, Andy Walz, president of Americas products for Chevron, sent a letter to the California Energy Commission saying that Newsom’s new refinery proposal “risks the safety of refinery operations, the orderly functioning of markets and would leave industry and labor experts without a voice in key policies.”
“The physical, operational and cost burdens to sustain unnecessary inventory are also a concern,” he wrote. “Building just one new storage tank can take a decade and cost $35 million. These costs would likely be passed onto the consumer. And given the current regulatory regime, with constraints on permits and a gasoline vehicle sales ban, there is no opportunity to recover capital invested to build additional tanks, which could be the ‘last straw’ for the state’s energy market investors.”
The timing of a second special session on oil regulations could work in Newsom’s favor if lawmakers immediately get to work.
Newsom will finish signing the bills on his desk by Sept. 30, which means he could have the political upper hand if the special session begins before that period concludes. If the special session begins after bill signing, the governor could lose some of that leverage.
But when, and, if, they ultimately pass, new mandates on the oil industry or lower electricity bills could affect the election.
Legislation that saves consumers money could give lawmakers something to tout to their constituents. Laws that potentially raise gas prices could be weaponized in California races or national contests.

Hillside erosion worsening in California due to wildfires and intense rain,https://www.latimes.com/environment/story/2024-08-31/erosion-following-california-wildfires-is-getting-worse-water-infrastructure-ecosystems-could-suffer,2024-08-31,"Over the last three decades, California has seen increasing erosion after major wildfires — a phenomenon that not only endangers water resources and ecosystems, but is also likely to worsen with climate change, according to researchers.
Anew study fromthe U.S. Geological Survey documented a tenfold increase in post-fire hillside erosion in Northern California from the late 1980s to the 2010s, with the majority of the largest sediment-producing fires occurring in the last decade.
This erosion causes a number of problems. When heavy rains scour charred hillsides, debris flows can choke rivers and streams, depriving fish of oxygen. Sediment runoff can also fill reservoirs and take up valuable water storage space, damage flood control infrastructure and threaten nearby communities vulnerable to flash flooding.
The research team noted that erosion after wildfires has accelerated across the state since 1984, with the northern half of the state recording the most noticeable change.
“In Northern California, we really see this huge increase [in post-fire erosion] from the first decade to the second to the third to the fourth,” said Helen Dow, a research geologist with USGS and the study’s lead author. “There’s just a large rise in sediment, both in mass ... and then also when we look at yield, being the mass per area.”
California
It’s not even the midpoint of summer in California and wildfires have already scorched more than 751,000 acres, straining firefighting resources, forcing evacuations and destroying homes.
By incorporating detailed modeling and field-based observations, the research team quantified soil and sediment loads from erosion between 1984 to 2021 for every year following a large wildfire, which the scientists classified as larger than 25,000 acres. This method was able to put a figure on an issue that ecologists, forest managers and water conservationistshave long wondered about.
“It’s not surprising ... but it’s good to see it quantified by USGS,” said Glen Martin, a spokesperson for the environmental nonprofitCalifornia Water Impact Network.
“It points out what the bigger problem is, which is, California — your water supplies, your reservoirs, your fisheries are already on the brink, and these catastrophic fires are going to push it over for a variety of reasons,” said Martin, who was not involved in the research.
Several studies have already shown that wildfires are growinglarger and more intense due to climate change. The same forces arealso increasingthe frequency of more extreme rainstorms across the state, leading to more episodes of “weather whiplash.”
The USGS paper, which was published recently in theJournal of Geophysical Research, found that 57% of the state’s post-fire erosion occurred upstream of reservoirs, “indicating a growing risk to water security.” Reservoirs are a key component of the state’s fragile water system, but the influx of sediment can both decrease a basin’s capacity and degrade its water quality.
“These results indicate increasing pressure on water resources from post-fire erosion with ongoing climate change,” study authors wrote.
California
Despite a relatively slow real estate market, a new report says billionaires are still buying homes in half-a-dozen markets. Two are in California.
Martin called the rise in erosion part of an “unvirtuous cycle” of more fires, more eroded soil, which leads to more infrastructure failures and, ultimately, less water.
It “has huge consequences for everything from fisheries to water supply, and this study confirms that,” Martin said.
USGS researchers expect that erosion after wildfires will only continue to increase across the state without comprehensive mitigation efforts, but Dow said documenting the extent of the problem is an important step for state and federal officials to look for interventions.
“Knowing this is a problem that’s worsening in Northern California, and having an idea of the size of the problem both in Northern and Southern California, might inform how agencies think about fire,” Dow said.
“What needs to be done is increased fuels control on both public and private lands,” Martin said, “so that when we do get fires, they aren’t absolutely devastating, burning down to mineral earth, turning the landscape into essentially a moonscape.”
Martin said fuel control could include include prescribed burns andmechanical thinning, or the targeted removal of certain trees.
California is already aware of the devastating and widespread effects erosion and debris flows can have following large fires.
InMontecito, heavy rainfall after the 2018 Thomas fire unleashed an avalanche of mud and debris that ravaged the town, killing 23 people and destroying 130 homes.
In 2022, amass fish die-off occurredin the Klamath River after successive landslides dumped fire-scarred soil and debris into the watershed, dropping dissolved oxygen levels for several hours.
Climate & Environment
The Park fire is burning along creeks that provide vital spawning habitat for California’s spring-run Chinook salmon. Biologists worry the fire will cause harm.
Sediment buildup has also plaguedDevil’s Gate Dam in Pasadena. Excess erosion has also clogged countless culverts, blocked roadways and buried infrastructure, increasing flood and safety concerns.
This year, the Park fire, whichburned through Mill and Deer creeksin the Central Valley, has threatened what Martin called some of last strongholds for endangered spring-run chinook salmon. He said heavy rains there could hurt any progress wildlife officials have made to support the fish population.
“Our salmon are already decimated by excessive water diversions; when you add this on top of it, it essentially makes it almost impossible for these runs to come back,” Martin said.
Dow said the team’s research only took into account erosion within the first year after a wildfire, so it probably underestimates the full extent of the problem.
The study was released alongside anotherUSGS studythat measured sediment in the Carmel River along California’s Central Coast. It concluded that after wildfires and extreme rain, sediment in the watershed greatly increased compared with long-term averages.
With the state facing an array of other major water issues, combating post-fire erosion through better land conservation and forest management is necessary, Martin said, but not simple.
“That’s going to take time, and it’s more than that: It’s going to take a lot of public will and money,” he said. “It’s a crisis situation. ... It’s only going to get worse until we really get serious about addressing it.”

"Calling for further study, California lawmakers table ban on toxic herbicide paraquat",https://www.latimes.com/environment/story/2024-08-31/california-lawmakers-call-for-further-study-of-paraquat,2024-08-31,"California lawmakers have approved a bill that could help strengthen regulations  on the use of paraquat, a powerful weedkillerassociated with Parkinson’s diseaseand other serious health issues.
Assembly Bill 1963was introduced in January by Assemblymember Laura Friedman (D-Glendale), and originally sought tosunset the use of paraquat in Californiabeginning in January 2026.
However, the final legislation has been amended so that it now will require the California Department of Pesticide Regulation to complete a reevaluation of the herbicide by Jan. 1, 2029, and determine whether to retain, cancel or suspend its registration, or to create new restrictions. The bill passed the Senate 23 to 8 and now awaits a signature from Gov. Gavin Newsom.
Paraquat is banned in more than 60 countries. Many environmental and advocacy groups had been hoping for an outright ban in California, but said the bill still marks a step forward by fast-tracking its safety review — a process that can sometimes take decades.
“We are encouraged by the progress being made in California setting the example for other states to act when it comes to evaluating the safety and toxicity of chemicals with long term neurological and other health implications,” read a statement from Julia Pitcher, director of state government relations for theMichael J. Fox Foundation for Parkinson’s Research. “We strongly urge the passage of this legislation and look forward to Governor Newsom signing it into law soon.”
Aggressive and impactful reporting on climate change, the environment, health and science.
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency describes paraquat ashighly toxic— noting that “one sip can kill” — yet California remains one of the nation’s top users of the chemical. The state sprays millions of pounds annually on crops such as almonds, grapes and cotton.
AnEnvironmental Working Group reportpublished earlier this year found that the state’s farmworkers and low-income Latino people, in particular, are disproportionately exposed to paraquat in their communities, with more than 5.3 million pounds sprayed in Kern County alone between 2017 and 2021.
The bill faced opposition from a coalition of opponents including pesticide manufacturers, chemical industry trade associations and agriculture trade organizations.
By the time it wound its way through the legislature, including the Senate Agriculture Committee, it had lost much of its teeth, said Bill Allayaud, California director of government affairs with EWG.
“It’s still a good bill, because without this, DPR probably wouldn’t do anything,” he said. “Hopefully the governor will sign it and agree that this is at the top of the list for things we don’t want people exposed to, especially farmworkers.”
Climate & Environment
Assembly Bill 1963 would sundown the use of the herbicide paraquat, which has been linked to Parkinson’s disease and other health issues, beginning in January 2026.
Paraquat has been the subject of thousands of lawsuits from people seeking damages related to exposure to the product, including people who say it has given them Parkinson’s disease, a neurodegenerative disorder that affects movement.
The bill’slegislative analysisnotes that at least 10 epidemiological studies have linked paraquat exposure to Parkinson’s disease, including a 2019 meta-analysis of 13 studies that found exposure to the herbicide was associated with a 1.64-fold increase in the risk of the disease.
Other studies havefound no clear link, however, and the product’s manufacturers continue to reject any claims of a connection.
In a statement, Friedman said AB 1963 will have “very real results.”
“I’m happy with where the bill landed,” Friedman said. “We never thought we’d get a full ban through the Legislature. But we had to push as hard as we could.”
She noted that theLegislature provided the Department of Pesticide Regulationwith additional funding this year with a requirement that the agency do more reevaluations of toxic chemicals.
“I have full confidence, that should AB 1963 get signed into law, that DPR will do a thorough reevaluation of paraquat, and either ban it outright, or place greater restrictions on its use,” Friedman said.
California
The Environmental Protection Agency issued an emergency ban on a common weed killer, DCPA or Dacthal, over concerns about the health risks for fetuses.
Advocacy groups remain committed to seeing the chemical controlled.
The EWG this weeklaunched a campaignwith the Michael J. Fox Foundation urging President Biden and the EPA to ban paraquat nationwide. The federal agency will have until Jan. 17 to make a decision.
There is some reason for optimism: The EPA last month issued a rare emergency order tostop the use of another weedkiller, dachthal, that poses a significant risk to fetuses.

Newsom energy plan sparks tug of war with lawmakers in final hours of legislative session,https://www.latimes.com/environment/story/2024-08-30/newsom-energy-package-sparks-legislative-tug-of-war,2024-08-30,"Amid tense, closed-door negotiations, Gov. Gavin Newsom and Democratic lawmakers have released a suite of seven bills that aim to reduce Californians’ soaring energy costs — including a controversial electricity affordability plan that critics say was substantially weakened by lobbying from utilities and will offer little real relief.
The governor’s eleventh-hour energy and environment proposal also contains bills that would secure oil reserves and streamline the approval process for clean energy infrastructure projects, with Newsomthreatening to force lawmakersto return to Sacramento this fall if an agreement can’t be reached on the oil item before the end of the legislative session.
The last minute tug-of-war between the governor and lawmakers left many stakeholders frustrated by the lack of time and transparency surrounding the bills, which must be approved by both houses of the state Legislature by the end of Saturday, when the two-year legislative session ends.
By offering the plan so late, it will most  probably get little public debate.
Aggressive and impactful reporting on climate change, the environment, health and science.
The top item of concern among many environmental groups isAssembly Bill 3121. Critics say the bill seeks to reducerising energy costsat the expense of several key energy and climate programs.
Analysts say the cuts will amount to a one-time savings of about $30 per consumer. Energy bills have been soaring in recent months due to increased demand driven by high temperatures, infrastructure upgrades and state regulations, among other factors.
But the plan seeks to achieve those savings by slashing three programs: The California Schools Healthy Air, Plumbing and Efficiency (CalSHAPE) Program, which funds HVAC improvements in schools; the Self-Generation Incentive  Program (SGIP), which supports the installation of energy storage and generation technologies in vulnerable communities; and the Solar on Multifamily Affordable Housing (SOMAH) program, which helps fund solar energy systems on multifamily affordable housing.
The programs “provide a myriad of climate, health, and affordability benefits to schools, tenants, and low-income communities in addition to the general ratepayer,” wrote a coalition of environmental, education, housing and energy groups in an Aug. 19open letteropposing the package.
“Cutting them would provide negligible reductions on energy bills in the short-term, while sacrificing the long-term climate and affordability benefits they provide.”
California
Some Southern California consumers say they’re frustrated with their costly electricity bills. Here’s what to do about it.
Over the last 10 years, rates at California’s three big utility companies have risen by as much as 110%, according to a recentquarterly reportby the California Public Utilities Commission’s Public Advocates Office.
In just the past three years, bills for customers of the three biggest for-profit utilities — Pacific Gas & Electric, Southern California Edison and San Diego Gas & Electric — have increased by 20% to 50%.
Critics said the plan fails to address the root causes of escalating bills, which include an electric rate setting system that allows the utility companies to earn profits as they build new transmission lines and other infrastructure and then bill customers for the expense.
“Distributed energy resource programs like SGIP and SOMAH have the potential to deliver substantial long-term benefits in terms of affordability, resilience, and reliability for all ratepayers,” read a statement from Edson Perez, California policy lead at Advanced Energy United. “California should focus on leveraging investments that both support disadvantaged communities and ratepayers, rather than reversing support of these crucial programs.”
Stephanie Seidmon, program director at Undaunted K12 — a nonprofit that advocates for climate resilience in schools — said the HVAC program is particularly important at a moment when COVID-19 is surging and California is dealing with worsening heat waves and wildfires, all of which underscore the need for proper air conditioning and ventilation in schools.
“These school districts are now left in the lurch because the program is effectively suspended,” Seidmon said. “This is just a really short-sighted giveaway that’s not making meaningful impact on the affordability crisis.”
California
California Gov. Gavin Newsom’s ultimatum is intended to counter the pressure oil interests are putting on lawmakers to reject his proposal that could require petroleum refiners to maintain a stable inventory.
Also stirring controversy isSenate Bill 950, which is aimed at controlling high prices at the gas pump by requiring petroleum refiners to maintain a stable inventory in order to prevent fuel shortages and price spikes when equipment is taken offline for maintenance.
Sources involved in the negotiations told The Timesthat some Assembly Democrats are concerned that adopting new requirements on oil refiners could ultimately increase the cost of gasoline. Lawmakers are also reportedly facing pressure from oil interests to reject the proposal.
In response, Newsom has proposed a special session that would bring lawmakers back to Sacramento in the fall, allowing for more time to weigh the proposal.
But Senate President Pro Tem Mike McGuire (D-Healdsburg) said Thursday he opposes convening a special session, and indicated that he wants the Senate to approve the measures before the end of the weekend.
“Californians shouldn’t have to wait for relief at the pump and on their utility bills,” McGuire said. “Inflation has been impacting the lives of millions and waiting for a special session will only make the problem worse for working families.”
“We’ve been working nonstop to deliver results and get these measures across the finish line. We’re ready — right now — to get the bills passed, sent to the governor, and signed into law,” he said.
California
The Office of Ratepayer Advocacy report said the expected costs are “not reasonable” for customers.
Other bills included in the package received a warmer reception from some environmental advocates, however.
Among them isAssembly Bill 3264, which would require the Public Utilities Commission to develop a framework for assessing and analyzing total annual energy costs for residential households.
The item calls for greater transparency from the PUC, including better reporting around what is driving costs, and a review of demand-side management programs that affect customer usage.
“Several of [these bills] are really positive steps in the right direction and will provide more oversight, more information, to start to correct some of the issues that we’re seeing with affordability in California,” said Merrian Borgeson, a policy director with the Natural Resources Defense Council. “AB 3264, I think, has some really positive things in it.”
Also better received wereSenate Bill 1003, which calls for increased oversight over wildfire mitigation spending, including line hardening and vegetation management projects that can drive up costs, andSenate Bill 1142, which would require electric and gas utilities to reconnect service for residential customers who had it cut off  because of nonpayment when customers agree to a payment plan.
The bills “at least try to address some of the problems that we’re seeing” with energy affordability, Borgeson said. However, she too was concerned by AB 3121, the bill that would cut solar and HVAC programs to provide one-time savings.
“Unfortunately, that relief is tiny, and it’s at the expense of programs that are providing updated ventilation to schools, solar on affordable housing — things that are really important for both climate and equity goals in the state,” she said.
Electric bills are rising. Here are ways to reduce the burden without slowing the shift to home and vehicle electrification to meet our climate goals.
The remaining items in the energy package,Senate Bill 1272andSenate Bill 1420, both involve the California Environmental Quality Act, or CEQA, and are aimed at accelerating clean energy development in the state through limiting environmental review processes and expedited permitting.
SB 1272 would “accelerate clean energy development,” according to Newsom’s staff, by speeding up the review process for potential harms the projects might have on the environment. The bill by state Sen. John Laird (D-Santa Cruz) says, “it is in the interest of the state to ensure that California’s environmental review processes are streamlined and optimized to ensure the most efficient process.”
The Legislature previously approved bills that are now state law that say 60% of California electricity must come from renewable sources by 2030 and 100% by 2045.
SB 1420 would similarly fast-track the development of federally funded clean, renewable hydrogen production facilities by authorizing them as eligible for the California Energy Commission’s expedited review permitting process and expedited CEQA judicial review process.
Last year, President Biden named Californiaone of seven hydrogen hubs in the nation— a designation that included a $1.2-billion federal investment toward building infrastructure for a “clean” hydrogen economy to replace fossil fuels and reduce greenhouse gas emissions in the state. However, some environmentalistsremain wary of hydrogen’s promise.
Despite the tension surrounding Newsom’s last-minute maneuvering, most experts concurred that high energy costs in California should be addressed.
Mark Toney, executive director of The Utility Reform Network (TURN) — a consumer advocacy group  — said the governor’s original electricity affordability plan included a measure that would have lowered the interest rates that utilities earn on capital investments such as transmission lines and power plants.
Current policy encourages utilities to build expensive infrastructure because they get to recover the cost — plus annual interest that is typically 10.5% — through rates billed to customers. The original plan was aimed at reducing that rate through a financing technique called securitization.
“It would create significant savings,” Toney said of the original proposal.
However, theSacramento Bee reportedlast week that Newsom had backed away from the proposal after criticism from big utilities.
At the same time, the state is pushing consumers to use more electricity by purchasing electric cars and replacing their gas appliances.
In May, the Newsom administration ignored complaints by hundreds of electric customers and pushed througha plan to add a new mandatory fixed chargeof $24.15 to each monthly electric bill. In return, customers will pay a lower rate for each kilowatt hour of power they use.
The three big utilities had lobbied for the new fixed charge. That bill was also unveiledso late by Newsomthat it was impossible for it to be fully debated in hearings.

Unusual October heat wave in California brings new fire fears; 1 million acres already burned,https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2024-09-30/october-ushers-in-blistering-heat-power-shutoffs-and-the-chance-of-plume-fires,2024-10-01,"Anunusually warm autumn heat waveis continuing to push temperatures up across California, heightening fire risks across the state and prompting power shutoffs in the north andadditional wildfire evacuationsin the south.
Heat advisories, many warning of temperatures in the triple digits this week, have been issued throughout the state, from San Diego through Redding, with most areas expecting highs at least 10 to 20 degrees above average for this time of year, according to the National Weather Service.
While fire season in California typically stretches through October or November, this kind of heat is abnormal for the season, helping dry out landscapes and drop humidity levels, conditions officials expect to more easily and quickly foster wildfire growth.
Pacific Gas & Electric followed through on warnings that it would cut power to residents facing dangerous fire weather, particularly “high winds and dry conditions.”
On Tuesday morning, about 200 customers in Shasta County were still enduring the planned shutoffs, down from about 9,000 customers who experienced the shutoffs Monday, according to Paul Doherty, a spokesperson for PG&E.
He said service was expected to be fully restored later Tuesday.
A total of 12,371 customers in 11 counties and two tribal areas were initially at risk for the  shutoffs, which are meant to minimize fires igniting during high-risk weather, especially since several deadly and destructive blazes in recent yearswere started by utility equipment.
Climate & Environment
The impending arrival of hot Santa Ana winds, combined with two years of overgrown vegetation, could pave the way for a fiery fall.
As temperatures began to climb in Southern California on Sunday, authorities orderedadditional evacuations and warningsbecause of flare-ups on the Line fire in San Bernardino County — which has been burning for almost a month. The 44,000-acre fire is still considered 80% contained, but increased heat in the area expanded the fire this weekend, exceeding firefighters’ expectations, the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protectionwrote in a Monday update.
“The dry vegetation, steep slopes and wind aligned yesterday to create conditions for the rapid fire spread,” Cal Fire officials said.
Nearby, the Bridge fire in the San Gabriel Mountains is 97% contained after burning through almost 55,000 acres in both San Bernardino and Los Angeles counties, including more than 80 buildings that were destroyed, according to Cal Fire. The Airport fire, in Orange and Riverside counties, was 95% contained, after destroying 160 structures and scorching about 23,500 acres.
The flare-up of theLine fireworsened Monday as evacuation orders expanded and firefighters lost some ground on containment of the San Bernardino County wildfire.
The new acres charred also pushed California across a grim milestone: 1 million acres burned in 2024 — something that hadn’t occurred since 2021. However, the burned acreage total for this year is, so far, roughly on par with the five-year average for the year to date.
Across Southern California, the National Weather Service is warning of “dangerously hot conditions” through Thursday, with highs reaching up to 107 degrees in several areas, including the San Fernando Valley, Santa Clarita Valley, Antelope Valley foothills and  5 Freeway corridor, the area’s excessive heat watch said. The weather service also issued ared flag warningthrough Thursday for the western San Gabriel Mountains and the 14 Freeway corridor, warning of “hot and unstable conditions” that can quickly contribute to rapid fire spread. A fire watch has also been issued for the San Luis Obispo County and Santa Barbara County interior mountains for Wednesday and Thursday.
These conditions could help spark “plume-dominated fires,” characterized by tall plumes of smoke that become exceptionally hot, potentially causing fires to grow erratically,   said Bryan Lewis, a National Weather Service meteorologist in Oxnard.
“California looks much warmer than average for the foreseeable future, with little or no prospect of rain anywhere,” Daniel Swain, a UCLA climatologist, said ina recent online briefing.The National Weather Service’s Climate Prediction Centerexpects above-average temperaturesto persist through at least mid-October across California, with much of the Westforecast to remainwarm all month.
This wave of summer-like heat is stretching across the Southwest, with Phoenix already enduringalmost a week of record-highdaily temperatures, hitting 113 degrees Sunday. Some daily temperature records were also set in Las Vegas and the surrounding arealast weekend. Death Valley is expected to top out at 115 degrees over the next few days.
California
Can today’s youth save tomorrow from climate change?
“Another unseasonably warm day is in store as temperatures remain 10-15 degrees above normal,” the National Weather Service office in Las Vegastweeted on Monday. “Stay cool and hydrated out there.”
Swain,on X,called it an “anomalously warm and dry pattern,” which will likely bring rare, late-season heat to the interior that could set temperature records in parts of California, continue to drive dangerous fires and delay the state’s rainy season.
“The warm and dry autumn that has already started to unfold and [is] likely to continue in the coming weeks will set the stage for an unusually late fire season across the interior West,” he said.
Gusty offshore winds over the next few days could be a concern across much of the California coast this week, especially given the higher temperatures, theNational Weather Service warned.
Beyond fire hazards, meteorologists are warning of health risks that come with excessive heat. The National Weather Service in the Bay Area is warning of temperatures that could cause heat illnesses — up to to 104 degrees in the North Bay and East Bay mountains and valleys through Wednesday.
“Drink plenty of fluids, stay in an air-conditioned room, stay out of the sun, and check up on relatives and neighbors,” theheat advisory said.“Children and pets should never be left unattended in vehicles under any circumstances.”
Much of the Central Valley is also expected to see temperaturesreach or surpass 100 degreesthis week, with some areas of the San Joaquin Valley and Sierra Nevada foothills expected to near monthly record highs.

"Fall baking! Soaring California temperatures spur power shutoff warnings, increased fire risks",https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2024-09-29/southern-california-weather-return-high-temperatures-fire-risk,2024-09-30,"For a minute there, it felt like fall.
But even as October kicks off, the cool weather reprieve is ending, California is going to see temperatures climb into the extreme range again, forecasters say.
“There is some potential for record-breaking heat,” said Todd Hall, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service in Oxnard.
Highs in some areas on both ends of the state could soar into the triple digits.
Temperatures this week in Southern California are expected to be about 10 degrees above normal, according to the weather service. Parts of Los Angeles County will begin to see high temperatures starting Tuesday, with Wednesday the hottest day of the week, Hall said.
Similarly, temperatures from inland parts of the Bay Area into the Sacramento Valley could reach the triple digits by Wednesday, bringing along with them dry wind gusts and an elevated risk of fast-moving wildfires.
In response,Pacific Gas & Electric has warnedmany of its customers that the utility could cut their power Monday and Tuesday to avoid sparking any new blazes. Some of California’s deadliest and most destructive blazes have been started by the utility’s equipment in last 10 years.
PG&E said it could cut power to customers in the following counties as part of a Public Safety Power Shutoff: Alameda, Butte, Colusa, Contra Costa, Glenn, Humboldt, Napa, Shasta, Sonoma, Tehama and Trinity.
Those same counties could face another power shutoff Tuesday, the utility warned.
Climate & Environment
Tactical disputes between the Forest Service and local fire agencies are not new, but recent federal staffing shortages have exacerbated long-simmering tension.
Last October, the statefaced a heat wavethat drove temperatures across Southern California 15 degrees above normal and brought record heat to Northern California.
Hall said that after the heat peaks on Wednesday, cooler temperatures should arrive later in the week for the Southland.
Woodland Hills is expecting a high of 105 degrees on Wednesday, and Burbank could see 97, Hall said. The weather service issued an excessive heat advisory beginning Tuesday through Wednesday evening for the San Fernando and Santa Clarita valleys, with temperatures reaching as high as 106.
Other parts of Southern California will also face triple-digit temperatures. Ojai is expected to hit 105 on Tuesday and Wednesday, while residents in Paso Robles could see temperatures reach 108. San Luis Obispo will see temperatures as high as 100 on those days as well.
Hall advised residents to be cognizant of the hot weather and avoid outdoor activity, or confine their activity to the early morning hours.
There is also an elevated fire risk with the rising temperatures, Hall said. But there are no high winds in the forecast that could drive the fire risk even higher.
Firefighters are still working on fully containing three Southern California wildfires. The Airport, Bridge and Line fires started near the beginning of September and have been burning for weeks.
Lifestyle
The Bridge, Line and Airport fires have burned about 184 square miles of land in Los Angeles, Orange and San Bernardino counties, affecting many popular outdoor destinations.
The Airport fire in Orange and Riverside counties has burned 23,526 acres and is 95% contained. Authorities have made daily progress, the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection said. The Bridge fire in L.A. and San Bernardino counties has burned 54,878 acres and is 97% contained.
The most active fire remaining is the Line fire in San Bernardino County, which was 83% contained but had a significant flare-up on Sunday, as the VictorvilleDaily Press reported. The county Sheriff’s Departmentissued an evacuation orderSunday afternoon for the community of Seven Oaks.
Cal Fire said the Line fire was still burning actively in Bear Creek on Sunday and producing a lot of smoky conditions because of dried-out fuels. Relative humidity in the fire area was expected to range as low as 12%, with winds gusting to about 15 mph. Cal Fire said it had strengthened the containment line on the ridge and had at least 10 helicopters working in the area.

"Staff shortage at U.S. Forest Service hampers Southland wildfire response, locals say",https://www.latimes.com/environment/story/2024-09-29/california-wildfire-fight-hampered-by-forest-service-staffing,2024-09-29,"On a scorching September afternoon, an Orange County public works crew moving boulders with heavy machinery sparked a brush fire. The blaze ignited less than two miles from the U.S. Forest Service’s Trabuco Station, but the station was unstaffed by federal firefighters. The only crew there was the Orange County Fire Authority’s Engine 18.
When that engine arrived on scene, the fire was just half an acre, burning in medium brush with a moderate rate of spread, according to radio communications provided by Orange County Fire Chief Brian Fennessy. The crew also encountered two people who required treatment for smoke inhalation, he said.
Fennessy wonders whether, had a Forest Service engine responded with them, the firefighters could have contained the flames to the grassy flats. Instead, the fire raced up steep slopes into forested areas, growing into a 23,000-acre behemoth that destroyed 160 structures and injured 22 people.
“There’s no question in my mind that two engines would have made a difference,” he said.
The Airport fire was the latest example of how Forest Service staffing shortages have hindered firefighting efforts, putting public safety at risk, according to Fennessy and other Southern California fire chiefs. They say that many of the region’s Forest Service stations have gone unstaffed in recent years, putting more pressure on state and municipal firefighting agencies to fill in gaps.
“The Southern California fire chiefs do believe strongly that this is affecting our local communities,” said San Bernardino County Fire Chief Dan Munsey, who together with Fennessy and other fire chiefs took their concerns to Forest Service Region 5 Director Jaime Gamboa at a meeting in Lake Arrowhead in July. The issues remain unresolved, they said.
Five U.S. congressional representatives from Southern California recently sent a letter to the Cleveland National Forest demanding answers about how officials are dealing with its staffing challenges, saying they believe those shortages likely contributed to the outcome of the Airport fire.
A letter from five U.S. Congress members demands answers on staffing shortages in the Cleveland National Forest.
The Forest Service disputed claims by the county fire chiefs, saying the agency is meeting its obligations to respond to emergencies and protect lives and properties.
Adrienne Freeman, a spokesperson for the agency, acknowledged that the Trabuco Station wasn’t staffed by federal firefighters when the fire broke out, but said other engines were positioned nearby to backfill that gap.
The Forest Service has regularly maintained full staffing levels in Southern California this summer by bringing in resources from other regions and out of state to fill in for engine companies that are unavailable, and daily reports cited by the fire chiefs that list Forest Service stations as unstaffed don’t necessarily reflect those “surge resources,” she said.
She also noted that the Airport fire was the third large blaze to break out within a 40-mile radius in Southern California in four days, on the heels of the Line fire near the San Bernardino National Forest and the Bridge fire in the Angeles National Forest.
“With three major fires starting in that close time frame and a finite number of firefighters across the board, you’re going to have a lot of unavailable engines,” she said.
Still, she said, the Forest Service’s response to the Airport fire was “robust and appropriate.” Computer-aided dispatch records show the agency sent three engines, one water tender, a fire patrol, a chief officer and aircraft within minutes of receiving the request for mutual aid, she said. And modeling from the California Office of Emergency Services illustrated that the conditions were conducive to rapid fire spread, she added.
“It’s highly speculative to say that one engine would have made a difference,” she said.
California
Orange County retains law firm as attorneys begin a coordinated effort to file potentially hundreds of claims from victims of the Airport fire.
Tactical disputes between the Forest Service and local firefighting agencies are nothing new. In the wake of the 2009 Station fire, then the largest in Los Angeles County, the Forest Service wasfound to have been slow to order reinforcementsfrom other agencies in a bid to control costs. That drew finger-pointing from federal officials, who said they did everything they could to get aircraft to the scene as soon as possible, and state and local agencies, whosaid they had aircraft at the ready that were never ordered.
During California’s devastating 2021 fire season, several state and local fire officialsspoke out against a Forest Service policyof allowing some fires to burn naturally in certain areas before suppressing them.
The staffing shortages are the latest issue to bring these long-simmering tensions to the forefront. Federal firefighters face grueling conditions that have grown more harrowing in partdue to climate change. They are generally much lower paid than their counterparts at state and municipal agencies, utilities and private companies. The Forest Service has sufferedan exodus of firefightersin recent years, many of them mid-career professionals such as captains and engine bosses who took with them decades of institutional knowledge that can’t easily be replaced.
The problem is particularly acute in Southern California, where fires tend to be extraordinarily complex and the cost of living high, especially in and around national forests that typically house resort communities. Unionized employees at the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection are currently considering a new labor contract that would reduce their workweek from 72 to 66 hours, which is expected to touch off a fresh hiring spree that may result in even more attrition from the Forest Service.
Advocateshave for years been warningthat this hemorrhaging of skilled federal firefighters, who remain the nation’s premier experts on battling wildland fires, threatens to compromise public safety. They have long been pushing for Congress to pass comprehensive reform, including permanent salary increases, housing stipends and expanded mental health programs.
Since 2021, legislators have passed a series of measures temporarily boosting wildland firefighter pay, but those bonuses have not counted toward overtime, hazard pay and retirement benefits.
“Meanwhile, we have our federal wildland fire workforce losing faith in Congress and the federal government and the agency, and they’re walking,” said Max Alonzo, national business representative for the National Federation of Federal Employees. “They are going pretty much anywhere else. So it’s a bad situation on the ground.”
California
A federal firefighter’s viral resignation letter is highlighting the job’s low pay and harsh working conditions in the age of climate change.
The shortages have resulted in Forest Service stations in Southern California sitting empty because there is no one to supervise them, according to the fire chiefs. Fennessy shared a staffing report from the morning of Sept. 9, when the Airport fire started, that listed 14 of the Cleveland National Forest’s 28 engines as unavailable and another report showing the Trabuco Station was unstaffed by federal firefighters for the first two weeks of the month. He described those staffing levels as typical.
Of the roughly 25 Forest Service stations in San Bernardino County, only 11 or so are staffed at any given time, at best, Munsey said.
“My belief is they are no longer adequately covering their fire stations on a daily basis,” he said. “They are losing the experience that is required to manage large incidents. Because of this, they’re putting a greater burden on local taxpayers, and on city and county fire engines who must now pick up the slack to protect our communities.”
One exception is the Angeles National Forest, which has robust year-round staffing, officials said. “I haven’t had those challenges that the other municipal fire chiefs have had to deal with, like, ‘Hey, where’s the Forest Service?’” said Los Angeles County Fire Chief Anthony Marrone.
Still, Forest Service firefighters typically deal only with wildfires and related land management activities. Local firefighting agencies have long handled other types of emergencies on federal lands, including traffic accidents, medical calls and structure fires. Over the last five years, the fire agencies of Kern, Los Angeles, Orange, San Bernardino and Ventura counties have together responded to, on average, 11,263 incidents on federal lands each year, according to figures compiled by Munsey.
The majority of those calls have been handled by San Bernardino County Fire, which has responded to federal lands an average of 8,529 times a year over the last five years, he said. These services come at an annual cost to county taxpayers of roughly $14 million, and the Fire Department receives no reimbursement from the federal government, he said.
Although wildland fires are a relatively small share of those incidents, they represent a growing burden that has resulted in more and longer responses in federal jurisdictions, Munsey said. Because many Forest Service stations are staffed only during the day and during fire season, local agencies that share borders with national forests are often the first to respond to wildland fires at night and during the offseason.
For instance, when a fire ignited atop Santiago Peak in the Cleveland National Forest one night in August 2023, it took the first Forest Service engine nearly three hours to arrive, leaving the initial response to Orange and Riverside counties, Fennessy said.
“Local government is the largest provider of mutual aid resources in the state of California,” he said. “So when an agency like the Forest Service is not able to staff fully statewide in this region, the resources to put out these fires, even if it’s a Forest Service fire in the federal responsibility area, defaults to local government.”
Climate & Environment
A prolonged heat wave across much of the western U.S. is challenging wildland firefighters, with an uptick in heat-related illnesses reported in California.
That has also at times meant that fewer local firefighters were available to respond to other emergencies. The events earlier this month, when the Line, Bridge and Airport fires raged simultaneously, represented a nightmare scenario.
“There was nobody in the mutual aid system,” Munsey said. “So on the Bridge fire, as it approached Mt. Baldy and Wrightwood, that forced me to make the decision to empty almost every single one of our fire stations into those communities to stop the fire.”
“We literally had nobody covering our fire stations,” he added. “That is not a position that a fire chief should ever be in.”
Both Munsey and Fennessy were critical of the Forest Service’s practice of bringing in firefighters from out of state to backfill unstaffed positions, saying they lack experience with California’s terrain, interagency agreements and operating procedures.
They believe that, if the Forest Service is unable to hire enough California firefighters to staff its stations, the agency should contract them out to local fire authorities instead. Twice this year, Fennessy met with Cleveland National Forest Supervisor Scott Tangenberg offering to assist, at one point saying that he’d staff the stations at no cost to the Forest Service.
California
Running Springs, a mountain town that dealt with a deadly blizzard last year, is now contending with the raging Line fire. But some residents are staying put.
Freeman, of the Forest Service, said that “everybody was strapped” when the three large fires hit — the mutual aid system was strained by their geographical proximity, complexity and sheer size, not federal staffing shortages.
She defended the practice of bringing in firefighters from out of state, saying that it allows the agency to avoid depleting local resources by pulling them from places with less fire activity.
Munsey has been pressing the need to address the federal staffing shortages during meetings with members of Congress for several years. He and other Southern California fire chiefs also met in April with representatives of the U.S. Fire Administration. He said that athough federal lawmakers who represent California are supportive, it’s hard to get a coalition to take up the issue because it’s not affecting the entire country.
He said that one recent anecdote brings the problem into sharp relief: During the Line fire, the Forest Service’s initial attack incident commander had to turn over his duties and position to someone else. He had to go take a medical exam because he was leaving the agency to work for Cal Fire.

These hiking trails are closed because of the Southern California wildfires,https://www.latimes.com/lifestyle/story/2024-09-27/hiking-trails-closed-southern-california-fires,2024-09-27,"As firefighters complete the final steps to controlling three blazes around Southern California, it’s becoming clearer how and where hiking trails will remain closed for the foreseeable future.
Some trails have burned in the Bridge, Line and Airport fires and will take a long time to recover. Others are closed out of an abundance of caution.
The Times has put together a comprehensive list to help you understand where you can recreate responsibly, and also, whether your favorite areas were burned in recent blazes.
In the coming months,volunteertrail crewsacross L.A. County andbeyondwill head to these areas tohelpwith recovery efforts. They are almost always in need of more volunteers.
To put together a better picture of the damage, The Times consulted mapping tool CalTopo, cross-referencing its maps and the fire footprints and forest closure orders with lists of local hiking trails to determine which routes were in the burn area. That said, just because a trail is in the burn area doesn’t mean it was destroyed. We’ll learn more about specific conditions of each trail in the coming weeks and months, as well as when trails might start to reopen.
Travel & Experiences
Whether you’re looking for ocean views or desert landscapes or soaring mountain peaks, Los Angeles offers miles upon miles of strikingly different trails.
The Bridge fire|The Line fire|The Airport fire
Almost 55,000 acres in the San Gabriel Mountains and nearby towns have been burned by the Bridge fire. That includes destroying homes and buildings inWrightwoodand the Mt. Baldycommunity.
As of Friday, the Bridge fire was 97%contained. Firefighters have completed a control line around the majority of the fire’s perimeter. But containment does not mean that the fire that has been extinguished. Wildfires can burn for weeks after full containment is reached and even after fire personnel leave if no risk remains to embers restarting a blaze.
On Sept. 21 , Angeles National Forest issued its Bridge fireclosure order, which applies to federally managed roads, trails and other amenities. It is set to remain in place until Dec. 31, 2025, although that date could change.
Last week we cross referenced CalTopo, local trail lists and the Bridge fire map to tell youwhich trailsappear to have been burned. Below you’ll find our updated list of trails that were burned by the fire and also those closed by the forest order.
📌 East Fork and Camp Williams area
The Bridge fire was named after Cattle Canyon bridge in the East Fork of Angeles National Forest, where it started.
Although the fire got close, firefighters were able to saveCamp Williams Cafe & General Storeand Camp Williams Mobile Home Park from burning.
However, the hiking trails below appear to have been affected, and unless otherwise noted, are closed:

Southern California is on fire again. If you’re still hankering to go outdoors, try these trails that are far away from the burned areas.
📌 Mt. Baldy area
The road to reach the mountain community of Mt. Baldy has reopened, andbusinessesare returning to normal operating hours.
Popular hiking trails, including Icehouse Canyon and Icehouse Saddle appear, via thefire map, to not have burned in the Bridge fire. Additionally, San Antonio Falls, Ontario Peak, Cucamonga Peak, Cedar Glen Camp, and the three T’s — Timber Mountain, Telegraph Peak and Thunder Mountain — also did not burn. Although the fire moved near Stoddard Peak’strailhead, its trail was spared.
Here is a list of some of the popular trails that appear to have burned, according to The Times’ analysis:
Additionally, these trails and sites do not appear to have been burned in the fire but are closed, per theclosure order:
📌 Wrightwood and Vincent Gap area
Although the fire got within about 500 feet of the Mt. Baden-Powell trail, it was not burned in the Bridge fire. Additionally, nearby mountains, including Mt. Burnham, Throop Peak and Mt. Hawkins, did not burn. The immediate area surrounding Jackson Lake was not burned, but multiple trails in that area did. TheGrassy Hollow Visitor Centerwas destroyed. Mountain High ski resortsurvivedand aims toreopenlater this year for its winter season.
Additionally, these trails and sites do not appear to have been burned in the fire but are closed, per theclosure order:
The Line fire, which isallegedto have been started Sept. 5 as an act of arson, has burned more than39,000 acresin San Bernardino County. It damaged four structures and destroyed one. It has also injured four firefighters. As of Friday, it was 83% contained with “minimal fire activity” and favorable conditions for firefightingexpectedin the coming days.
Several hiking trails are temporarily closed under the San Bernardino National Forest’s Line fireclosure order,which ropes off what The Times estimates to be about 70% of national forest land to the public andincludeslarge swaths of the region that weren’t burned by the fire. The order includes all of the Front Country and Mountaintop Rangerdistricts, and trails near Lake Arrowhead and Big Bear, among many others that did not burn.
The closure extends beyond the fire’s perimeter because “the fire is not completely contained,”saidSonny St. John, a patrol captain with the federal Forest Service’s Law Enforcement and Investigations unit on the San Bernardino National Forest. “We want to limit using resources on other parts of the forest where incidents could also occur.”
Travel & Experiences
No one wants to be on their phone while out enjoying nature, but using apps like iNaturalist and others can maximize, not distract, from the experience.
You can find a list of every trail and road closedhere. In short, any trail in the San Bernardino National Forest that’s outside of the San Jacinto RangerDistrict— which sits south of the 10 Freeway and includes the Idyllwild area — is closed.
St. John said the order could be adjusted in scope and size, or terminated, as conditions allow. In the interim, it’s best tocall aheadbefore visiting the area to determine whether the hiking area you’d like to visit is open.
Below you’ll find a list of trails that, based on The Times analysis, were burned by the fire.
Note: Just because a trail is listed doesn’t mean it was destroyed. There aren’t data available yet to discern how severely burned each trail was. This is a preliminary list, based on the Line fire burn map.
Popular attractions, including theTrail of the Phoenixin the National Children’s Forest,Little Green Valley Trailand climbing spotDinosaur Rocks,did not burn. TheShady Cove Group Campgroundin the Children’s Forest was also spared. And the fire got close but did not destroy theBluff Lake Reserve, where firefighters have quickly extinguished spot fires threatening the 80-acre reserve. TheMorton Peak Fire Lookoutsuffered some damage but was not destroyed, per aSouthern California Mountains Foundationrepresentative.

From TikTok-famous nieces to birding besties, this list will help you choose the right L.A. hike for just about every type of visitor.
The Airport fire, unintentionallystartedby workers using heavy machinery to move boulders, has burned almost 24,000 acres since it began Sept. 9 near Trabuco Canyon in Orange County. It destroyed 160 structures, includingseveral homesin El Cariso Village, and damaged 34 others. An estimated 22 people, including firefighters, have been injured. As of Friday, the fire was 95% contained.
Cleveland National Forest — where much of the fire has burned — issued a closure order that bars the public from entering the 138,971 acres of the Trabuco Ranger District, an area far larger than the fire’s footprint. All trails in the district are closed to the public. A list of closed trails and roads is availablehere. The order is set to expire Sept. 17, 2025.
Below you’ll find a list of trails that, based on The Times analysis, were burned by the fire.
Again, just because a trail is listed doesn’t mean it was destroyed. This is a preliminary list, based on the Airport fire burn map.
The Airport fire did not reach theOrtega Oaks 74 Candy Store and Goods, a popular stop for hikers headed to nearby trails, including Sitton Peak, which did not burn.Ortega Fallsalso appears to have been spared, sitting only about 240 feet south of the fire’s eastern flank.

MORE FROM THE L.A. TIMES",4 stars,0.5
I toured L.A.’s Rim of the Valley by plane. Here’s why we need to protect it,https://www.latimes.com/travel/newsletter/2024-10-31/the-wild-rim-of-the-valley-santa-monica-mountains-plan-the-wild,2024-10-31,"As our small plane flew over the San Fernando Valley, I was in awe of just how remarkable and diverse the region’s wild lands are.
I smiled remembering all the hikes I’ve taken in thisarea, also known as the Rim of the Valley corridor. I’ve huffed and puffed up the steep Verdugo Mountains on the eastern side of the valley, playing on boulders in the Simi Hills and Santa Susana Mountains. I’ve stood in awe of ocean views from high above in the Santa Monica Mountains.
But the biggest takeaway from that flight — hosted by nonprofitsNational Parks Conservation AssociationandEcoFlight— was just how developed the areaaroundthe Rim of the Valley is. When I joined the group for a tour of the region on Oct. 22, I saw thousands of homes (including a mansion with a Lakers-themed basketball court) and businesses drawing ever nearer to the foothills of our local ranges. It was witnessing that creeping urban sprawl from thousands of feet up that helped me understand why advocates are urging legislators to protect it.

For decades environmental activists and elected officials have tried to pass legislation that would add thousands of acres of the Rim of the Valley corridor to the Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation Area.
The concept was originally imagined byMarge Feinbergin the mid-1970s when she proposed a “green belt” in her master’s thesis. Feinberg wanted to see a trail system that connected the entire valley, allowing you to hike 200 miles around the area. (More on this in a minute!)
The Rim of the Valley corridor is generally said to include the mountains that encircle the San Fernando, La Crescenta, Santa Clarita, Simi and Conejo valleys. It includes the L.A. River and Arroyo Seco as well as existing parks, including Griffith Park and its Hollywood sign.
In 1990, Republican Gov. George Deukmejian green-lighted the completion of amaster planof the Rim of the Valley trail corridor, but that didn’t result in widespread action.
During the George W. Bush administration, Congressfinanceda study of the Rim of the Valley, which the National Park Service completed in 2016 after holding several meetings and receiving thousands of comments. A bill then wound its way through Congress during the Trump administration, passing in the House but dying in the Senate.
Previous iterations of legislation would have added 191,000 acres of land to the Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation Area, which isalmost154,000 acres. But, facing widespread backlash from developers and construction lobbyists, those bills never took.
The latest effort, primarily driven by aSenate bill, would protect 118,000 acres of the Rim of the Valley’s native grasslands, coastal sage scrub, forests and more. Local parks, including Ernest E. Debs Regional Park, Griffith Park and El Pueblo de Los Angeles, likely would be included and serve as hubs of the Rim of the Valley park area.
Any land that was zoned residential or commercial, or that was already developed for those purposes, was removed from the proposal.
“Really what’s left is open space already protected at the local level,” said Dennis Arguelles, a senior program manager in the National Parks Conservation Assn.’s L.A. field office.
So then, what’s the point of the federal legislation?
Adding the Rim of the Valley corridor to the Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation Area would allow the National Parks Service to offer its resources to local government agencies. If a local park within the Rim of the Valley land wanted to restore native habitat, its staff could consult with biologists, botanists and other experts who work for the National Park Service at no cost.
The National Park Service also could invest in ongoing restoration projects of local wetlands, watersheds and coastline, including theL.A. River,Arroyo SecoandTujunga Wash.
The proposed bill also would enable the National Park Service to spend money on trail maintenance. With that ability, the National Park Service could offer its support (and muscle) to work with counties and cities to create a interconnected200-miletrail system, making the late Feinberg’s dream a reality. Once completed, it could be designated as anational recreation trail— a remarkable thing to have in the heart of L.A. County, especially for outdoor explorers like us Wilders.
Connecting the land could help us protect wildlife. The National Park Service could coordinate with local and state government agencies and nonprofit groups to ensuremountain lions,bearsand other local critters can safely move among mountain ranges.
The National Park Service could hire local transportation agencies to improve access to parks. Many areas of L.A. remain “park poor,” activistssay, and millions of residents don’t have parks within a half-mile of their homes.
The Rim of the Valley land also includes areas that are culturally significant to local tribes and other historic sites, but overall its land is not well documented. The National Park Service would work with researchers to identify and protect these places.
If the law is passed, the National Park Service also would be able to buy land that’s a priority to conserve from willing sellers. So this wouldn’t be some sort of eminent domain situation.
And, in terms of public land included in the Rim of the Valley corridor, current land managers — whether that be the city of L.A., theMountains Recreation and Conservation Authorityor other local agencies or cities — would continue to operate and manage their land, facilities, rivers and other bodies of water. The National Park Service’s role would be to establish management agreements with these agencies and jurisdictions to share its staff, facilities and money, which would make it easier to collaborate. (No one wants the environmental equivalent of a college group project where just one person makes the slideshow.)
In its current iteration, the Rim of the Valley bill is supported by several local groups, including the nonpartisan National Parks Conservation Assn., Las Virgenes Homeowners Federation, multiple Audubon Society and Sierra Club local chapters and theChinese American Citizens Alliance(Los Angeles).  Several local jurisdictions whose land would be included in the Rim of the Valley corridor — including L.A., Ventura County, Santa Clarita and Glendale — support current efforts to develop the corridor.
Advocates hope that the Senate bill will be attached as an amendment to the National Defense Authorization Act, which has worked for other causes.
Whether it passes in thelame-ducksession of Congress will depend, like all the times before, on whether there is finally political will to get this done. Lawmakers have said they’d like tomove quicklyto push through the defense act, a must-pass piece of legislation, by the end of November.
To lend your support to the Rim of the Valley corridor, you can contactyour representativesin Congress and request their support for Senate Bill 1466 and House Bills 5881 and 2887, which all apply to the Rim of the Valley. You can learn more about getting involved atnpca.org.

I am elated to report that the world’s largest wildlife crossing is standing, a labor of love, lobbying and lions that took years to plan. Times staff writer Jeanette Marantosreportsthat the Wallis Annenburg Wildlife Crossing, which spans the 101 Freeway in Agoura Hills, is expected to be finished by 2026. But  you won’t be able to hike across it. “This space will be off-limits to humans once the crossing is completed, with locked gates to keep people out and discreet fencing to guide wildlife away from nearby homes into the wild hills beyond,” writes Marantos. “The crossing is designed to feel like an extension of the hills and valleys in the area to re-create the seamless corridor that existed before the noisy, busy freeway made passage so dangerous.” It is surprisingly quiet on the crossing, where over the next two years, workers will lay down gravel, tons of specially designed dirt and “hyper-local” native plants, including white, purple and black sage, and laurel sumac, whose seeds were procured within a five-mile radius of the crossing.
I personally cannot wait to drive under the crossing in 2026. I’m quietlythanking P-22for teaching us the necessity of these crossings
Happy adventuring,
Happy Halloween! This is my favorite holiday of the year. If you want to celebrate outdoors, perhaps consider hiking toPumpkin Rockin Norco.

Fact-checking Trump’s biggest claims on immigration: How do they measure up?,https://www.latimes.com/politics/story/2024-10-31/we-fact-checked-some-of-trumps-most-common-claims-on-immigration,2024-10-31,"WASHINGTON —Migrants, according to former President Trump, are violent criminals, voting illegally, eating your pets, draining emergency disaster funding and stealing your job.
These claims have elicited fear, hatred and anger among many voters.
We looked into the facts around some of his most frequent statements about immigration and the border, some of which he has repeatedhundreds of times.
Politics
Former President Trump says that if reelected, he will initiate the largest mass deportation of undocumented immigrants in history. Experts say that’s unlikely.
Trump’s claim:“The day I left office, the border was the safest it ever was in the history of our country,” Trump said this month at a Fox News town hall. “We had the fewest number of people.”
Fact check:Trump often uses a chart that he says demonstrates that border crossings were at an all-time low when he left office. He was pointing to such a chart during a July campaign rally when a gunman tried to kill him.
The arrow on the chart actually points to April 2020, eight months before he left office.That month marked athree-year low in crossings.Global migration at the time had dwindled because of the COVID-19 pandemic.
After that, border arrests began to increase through the end of Trump’s term, Border Patrol figures show.
Trump’s claim:that he built“571 miles of wall”on the southern border.
Fact check:After he took office, the U.S. Customs and Border Protection built458 miles of new wall, agency figures from January 2021 show. Just 85 of those miles were in locations where no barriers previously existed. The other 373 miles replaced dilapidated or outdated barriers.
Trump’s claim:“Twenty-one million people came in over the last three years with them,” he said. “We’re not going to have a country left. There’s no country that can sustain this.”
Fact check:It’s likely far less. Border agents recorded roughly10.5 million “encounters”with migrants nationwide since President Biden took office, a number that includes millions ofrapid expulsionsand multiple attempts by the same person to cross. Others were placed in deportation proceedings and have since been removed from the country.
House Republicans estimate roughly2 million migrantsevaded detection altogether, but that’s not nearly enough to total 21 million, as Trump claims.
Trump’s claim:Last month on Truth Social, Trump claimed that“13,000 convicted murderers”entered the U.S. under Biden.
They“roam free to KILL AGAIN,”hewrote the next day.
Fact check:The statistics Trump cited are not about people who entered specifically during the Biden administration. They refer to immigrants who entered under any administration, including Trump’s.
Politics
In the wake of the attempted assassination, Trump’s campaign messaging continued undeterred, casting immigrants as the source of violence in the United States.
In a letter to Rep. Tony Gonzales (R-Texas), Patrick Lechleitner, acting director of Immigration and Customs Enforcement, said there were13,099 people with homicide convictionson the agency’s “non-detained docket” as of July 21.
That docket is a list of people, with and without criminal convictions, who are not currently held in immigration detention. Some have been listed for decades because their country of citizenship won’t let the U.S. deport them back. Many are still serving jail or prison sentences for their crimes.
Trump has also broadly painted migrants as violent criminals. Researchers have found that undocumented immigrants commit crimes atsubstantially lower ratesthan native-born citizens.
Trump’s claim:“They’re going to be attacking — and they already are — Black population jobs, the Hispanic population jobs, and they’re attacking union jobs too,” Trump said during a recent campaign rally in Pennsylvania. “So when you see the border, it’s not just the crime. Your jobs are being taken away too.”
Fact check:Data on U.S. employment and the economy overwhelmingly suggest a different reality, asThe Times’ Don Lee reported. Migrants fill otherwise vacant jobs, help to keep job creation strong and provide an influx of millions of tax dollars.
Economists say immigrants without legal status most often take onlabor intensivepositions that native-born workers are unwilling to fill, such as in the agricultural sector. Two in three farmworkers are immigrants,according to the USDA, and 41% hold no work authorization.
In California, the population of U.S. citizens ages 16 and older fell by 625,000 from 2021 to 2023, according to data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, while employment rose by 725,000. Employment rates for native- and foreign-born residents fell by similar levels, indicating that immigrants aren’t taking jobs from Americans.
Trump claim:“You have large numbers of terrorists coming in like we’ve never seen,” Trumptold Asheville, N.C.’s ABC 13 Newsin August. “We have thousands of terrorists coming into our country.”
Fact check:Government data suggest the numbers are considerably smaller, and that domestic terrorism, such as that inspired by white supremacy, poses a far greater terrorism threat today than foreign-born extremists.
DHS data showthat arrests of people on the terrorist watchlist have declined since January after increasing each year with overall migration trends since fiscal year 2021. As of July, 139 people on the watchlist were stopped at the U.S.-Mexico border and 283 at the U.S.-Canada border. The watchlist includes people directly engaged in or supporting terrorist activities, as well as people associated with them, such as family members.
An analysisby the libertarian-leaning Cato Institute showed 230 foreign-born terrorists planned, attempted or carried out attacks on U.S. soil from 1975 through 2023, resulting in 3,046 murders. Nine entered the U.S. illegally, 13 were asylum seekers, 29 were refugees, 79 were permanent residents and the others were on some type of visa or from countries that aren’t required to get one. The status of 15 terrorists couldn’t be determined.
“During that period, the chance of being murdered by a foreign-born terrorist on U.S. soil was 1 in 4,449,257 a year,” the analysis states.
Trump claim:In January, Trump told an Iowa crowd that Democrats are allowing migrants into the country“to sign these people up to vote. They can’t speak a word of English for the most part, but they’re signing them up.”
Fact check:Illegal voting by migrants is a claim Trump and other Republicans have made in previous election cycles.Experts say such claims are unsupportedand give fuel to extremist ideologies, such as the so-calledgreat replacement theory, a racist conspiracy that there’s a plot to reduce the population of white people.
Politics
Republicans are betting that raising illegitimate fears about noncitizen voting will resonate with voters frustrated by illegal immigration.
By law, only U.S. citizens are eligible to vote for president and other top federal offices, and anyone else who attempts to will face fines, imprisonment and possible deportation.
Data indicate that voting by noncitizens is rare. For example, a study of the 2016 election by theBrennan Center for Justicefound that officials referred about 30 cases of suspected noncitizen voting for investigation or prosecution.
Trump claim:In New York on Sunday, Trump said,“325,000 children are missing, dead, sex slaves, or slaves. They came through the open border and they’re gone.”
Fact check:This appears to be based on an August reportby the Department of Homeland Security’s Office of Inspector General that stated more than 32,000 unaccompanied migrant children failed to appear for their immigration court hearings from fiscal years 2019 to 2023.
On top of that, Trump appears to be inappropriately adding 291,000 children who, according to the report, had not been served notices to appear in immigration court as of May 2024.
The report said children “who do not appear for court are considered at higher risk for trafficking, exploitation, or forced labor.”
But the report did not state that any children were, as Trump claimed, missing, dead, sex slaves, or slaves.
Experts saidthe report alsomissed crucial contextabout why some children failed to appear, including that some had pending applications for relief, distrust of federal agencies and outdated mailing addresses. In addition, the data cover more than a year of Trump’s presidency.
Trump claim:During his debatelast month against Vice President Kamala Harris, the former president claimed that in Springfield, Ohio, immigrants are“eating the dogs. … They’re eating the cats. They’re eating the pets of the people that live there.”
Fact check:That comment came after his running mate, JD Vance, stoked lies on X that Haitian migrants are stealing and eating pets in Springfield. In an interview with CNN, Vance defended amplifying the rumors, saying he was willing to “create stories” to get his message across.
Politics
Even if the topic was his 2020 election loss or the Jan. 6 insurrection, Trump brought up immigration in his debate against Harris.
Ohio leaders includingRepublican Gov. Mike DeWinesaid they received no credible reports substantiating the rumors. The city becameinundated with hoax bomb threatsthat forced lockdowns, evacuations and closures at schools, government buildings and hospitals.
Trump claim:In the wake of Hurricane Helene, Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro N. Mayorkas said the Federal Emergency Management Agency is meeting immediate needs butdoesn’t have the fundsto make it through the rest of the hurricane season. Trump and his supporters seized on the statement, claiming FEMA has given so much money to cities dealing with an influx of migrants that it has none left for natural disasters.
“It’s all gone,”Trump saidduring a visit to a hard-hit community in North Carolina.“They’ve spent it on illegal migrants.”
Fact check:In fiscal year 2024, Congressappropriated $650 millionto a program that helps state and local governments provide temporary shelter and other services to migrants who are released from federal custody near the border. The funding comes from the budget of U.S. Customs and Border Protection, but is administered by FEMA.
FEMA’s disaster relief funding is significantly higher — Congress appropriated $36 billion in fiscal year 2024, according tothe agency’s budget.
FEMA’s money also isn’t “all gone.” Agency officials said they can meet immediate needs but, after back-to-back hurricanes in a year of tornadoes, wildfires and flooding, theymight need to askCongress for more funding sooner than expected.

Could Trump really cut off wildfire aid for California? Absolutely,https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2024-10-31/can-trump-really-cut-off-california-wildfire-aid,2024-10-31,"Donald Trump has repeatedly threatened to cut off federal disaster aid for California’s wildfires if he returns to the White House, most recently ata campaign rally in Coachellaand in remarks at his golf course inRancho Palos Verdes.
Such a loss in federal funds would be a devastating blow to a state where wildfires have grown larger and more destructive in part due to climate change. A single severe fire season can rack up tens of billions of dollars in damage, firefighting costs and economic losses. The prospect of losing disaster aid has state officials and politicians mulling contingency plans ahead of next week’s election.
“This falls into Trump’s revenge agenda,” said Rep. John Garamendi (D-Walnut Grove). “He has promised revenge on those who did not support him, or who challenged him, California being one of several states.”
Trump has said he’ll withhold disaster funding if state officials don’t back his policies — most recently threatening to do so if Gov. Gavin Newsom doesn’t make more water available to farmers and homeowners.
“We’re going to take care of your water situation, force it down his throat, and we’ll say: Gavin, if you don’t do it, we’re not giving any of that fire money that we send you all the time for all the fire, forest fires that you have,”Trump said in Coachella.
The threats appear to be founded. Presidents have an extraordinary amount of discretion when it comes to disaster aid, which Trump reportedly wielded as a political cudgel during his presidency.
He initially refused to approve federal aid to California for wildfires in 2018 until a National Security Council staffer showed him that Orange County had a dense concentration of supporters, according toa report from Politico’s E&E News. Trump also ignored a 2020 request for aid for Washington state fires amid a feud with Gov. Jay Inslee, with the funds greenlighted only when President Biden took office months later,the outlet reported.
“We are building a track record of this kind of behavior becoming more than a threat,” said Brian Rice, president of California Professional Firefighters. “It is appearing to be a potential reality. And it’s very concerning.”
The California firefighters association endorsed Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris — breaking from its national union, which did not back either candidate — in part because of Trump’s threats.
Politics
Former President Trump has again questioned U.S. election integrity, claiming without evidence that Democrats are cheating in the presidential race. Experts condemned the rhetoric.
California and other states receive most federal wildfire aid through the Federal Emergency Management Agency in a process dictated by the federal Stafford Act and a regulatory framework that implements the law. That includes individual assistance — direct payments and services to homeowners and renters whose properties were damaged — and public assistance, which pays for things such as search-and-rescue teams, debris removal and infrastructure repair.
In order to qualify for such aid, a state must show that an incident is of such a severity and magnitude that a response is beyond the state’s capability. The governor must request, and the president must declare, a major disaster and then approve whatever aid the governor requests.
This is done through a step-by-step process in which local, state and federal governments assess damage and make sure they meet certain financial thresholds. Based on that information, FEMA decides whether a federal disaster declaration is warranted and issues a recommendation to the president. In the past, presidents have followed that recommendation, but there’s nothing in the law that requires them to do so.
Similarly, presidents are not legally compelled to consider certain factors when making a decision on disaster aid, and there’s no requirement that they do so in a timely manner.
States can appeal a denial of aid, but the president ultimately decides on the outcome of the appeal, said Matt Sedlar, climate analyst at the Center for Economic and Policy Research, who has studied how disaster relief funds are apportioned
“My main message is, yes, absolutely, bad things can happen to California, if Trump acts on his threats,” he said.
A denial of FEMA-recommended disaster aid would generate political fury and probably result in a lawsuit on the basis of the decision being arbitrary and capricious, said Garamendi, who sits on the Subcommittee on Economic Development, Public Buildings, and Emergency Management, which conducts oversight of FEMA. But it’s unclear how the courts would rule.
“It would be a hell of a stink from members of Congress and Senate putting a lot of pressure on the president, particularly given what Trump has said is his agenda,” Garamendi said. “I guarantee that would happen: political blowback and a lawsuit.”
All states are susceptible to hazards, ranging from storms and floods to fires and even terrorist attacks, that would make them eligible for federal assistance. Officials fear Trump would base his decisions on whether to approve aid on a state’s political leanings — for instance, by denying assistance to California or Washington while approving money to states where his campaign had strong support.
After Hurricane Michael hit Florida in 2018, Trump directed FEMA to pay 100% of most of the state’s disaster costs instead of the customary 75%, resulting in $350 million more in federal assistance than the state would have received without intervention,Politico reported.
According to Gov. Ron DeSantis’ autobiography, when he asked Trump for help, the then-president replied, “I must have won 90% of the vote out there. Huge crowds. What do they need?”
Politics
Trump’s visit to the home state of his opponent, Vice President Kamala Harris, offers him a chance to bash the liberal policies of the Bay Area native.
California has been denied federal money for wildfires in the past. In 2021, state officials spoke out when Bidendeclined to make available individual assistance to victims of the Caldor fire, which destroyed more than 1,000 structures in the Sierra Nevada. The president did declare a disaster and approve public assistance. But Biden’s decision was based on — not in spite of — a recommendation from FEMA, which said it had considered the amount of destruction, residents’ insurance coverage and income levels and the fiscal resources of the state before determining the fire did not warrant individual aid.
There is at least one notable exception: Fire management assistance grants, which provide federal funding for up to 75% of eligible firefighting costs for major wildfires, do not require presidential approval. They must be approved only by a regional FEMA administrator. The agency has approved nine of those grants to California this year so far.
Still, FEMA’s director and regional administrators are appointed by the president, making it possible Trump could install officials who would carry out his wishes.
“There are many mechanisms by which the federal government can hurt a state,” Sedlar said.
Experts believe that if a president rejects providing federal aid, state officials would seek alternatives. Some aid may continue to be available through other federal agencies such as the Department of Transportation, which could help with rebuilding highways, putting up road barriers and cleaning culverts, Garamendi said.
But the ultimate burden to make up the difference would fall on California, he and others said, raising the possibility of cuts to other programs or funds to come up with the money.
Newsom recentlytold Politicothat he’s working with other officials to create plans in the state budget for an account California can draw from to pay for disaster response, in the event FEMA aid is no longer available under a future Trump presidency.
“You’re going to have serious cash flow issues even in a state as large as California, even with budget reserves that are significant,” the governor told the outlet.
Politics
President Biden appeared to call supporters of former President Trump ‘garbage.’ He then said he only meant the racism on display at Trump’s New York rally was garbage.
California’s need for federal disaster assistance over the next four years is virtually guaranteed. Requests for federal aid are a routine occurrence, to deal with not only worsening wildfires but also severe storms that have become more common as the West suffers more extreme shifts from wet to dry.
Already this year, Newsom has requested presidential disaster declarations for damage to homeowners and renters stemming from thePark firein Northern California and theBorelfire in Kern County, both of which are  under review, FEMA said.
Biden has also granted two major disaster declarations for severe storms in California. The first, greenlighted on Feb. 19 forstorms and flooding in San Diego County, resulted in more than $27 million in FEMA assistance for homeowners and renters.
The second, declared on April 13 forsevere winter storms, tornadoes, flooding and landslidesin Glenn, Butte, Sutter, Santa Cruz, Monterey, San Luis Obispo, Santa Barbara, Ventura and Los Angeles counties, resulted in more than $5.1 million in FEMA assistance to communities that sustained damage to public infrastructure, according to the agency.
In some years, the dollar amount can be much higher. After California’sdevastating 2020 fire season, when the state saw more acres burn than any other year on record, FEMA approved more than $700 million in individual and public assistance.
Politics
A survey shows that most Americans have seen a deepfake in recent months, and most worry about AI-generated misinformation influencing elections.
To deny such aid on the basis of political grudges would strike at the heart of the time-honored mutual aid system on which the country’s disaster response has been based for hundreds of years, Rice said.
“Regional, state and federal support is everything — it’s how the United States functions,” he said. “We don’t threaten each other. We don’t play games with people’s lives.”
When that system is politicized, he added, community members are the ones ultimately hurt.
“The Legislature in California doesn’t lose a goddamn thing and neither does City Council or the Board of Supervisors,” he said. “It’s the people who live in California who are under threat, that’s who suffers.”

The world’s largest wildlife crossing is finally standing. Here is what’s coming next,https://www.latimes.com/lifestyle/story/2024-10-29/agoura-hills-wildlife-crossing-101-freeway-native-shrubs-wildflowers-to-come,2024-10-29,"It doesn’t take a hawk eye to recognize that the Wallis Annenberg Wildlife Crossing over the 101 Freeway in Agoura Hills is not your normal Caltrans project.
For one thing, there’s the color. Most Caltrans structures are the light gray of natural concrete. But to reduce reflectivity and help the crossing blend in more with the surrounding land, the new crossing’s 27 million pounds of concrete have been colored a shade dubbed “dusty mocha” by the project’s lead designer, Robert Rock, a landscape architect for Chicago-basedRock Design Associates.
The official name, however, isFederal Standard Color 595-33105, a hue “inspired,” Rock said, by the soil around the crossing that will eventually provide wildlife safe passage between the Santa Monica Mountains to the south and the Simi Hills and Santa Susana Mountains to the north when the project is completed.
For the record:
9:23 a.m. Oct. 29, 2024An earlier version of this story incorrectly reported that Robert Rock works for Living Habitats. He now has his own firm, Rock Design Associates. It also incorrectly reported that Katherine Pakradouni was the founder of the project’s nursery. She was the former manager.
When the project began in 2022, the end date was projected to be late 2025, but severe rain and heat the past two years caused delays that have pushed completion to sometime in 2026, said Rock. Weather extremes can wreak havoc on construction projects, especially when they involve so much concrete, he added.
Nonetheless, there’s been plenty of progress. The crossing now spans the 101, and up on the deck — 21 feet and 8 inches above the freeway — there’s a marked difference from the noise on the ground, where the traffic is so loud it’s hard to have a shouted conversation (unless all you’re saying is “What?!”).
On Oct. 16, Caltrans senior bridge engineer Darwin Vargas led a group to the top of the structure, promising serenity once we stepped on the deck. He was right. At the top, the deck looks like a moonscape,  and the roar of rushing cars and trucks was barely discernible, thanks to the thick, 12-foot-tall sound walls on either side of the structure, which is slightly wider than an American football field and about three-quarters  its length.
On that day, workers were using power tools (and even those sounds were muffled) to smooth the sides and surface of the concrete deck, preparing it for the next steps — waterproofing the concrete and covering it with heavy rubber sheets about 2 inches thick. After that will come a “giant mattress of gravel” 12 inches deep, Rock said, laced with perforated pipes to collect runoff and direct it  into Liberty Canyon Creek.
It’s hard to tell as you’re driving underneath, but the crossing is slightly slanted, about two feet lower on the north end than the south to help drain off any moisture, because the last thing you want on a concrete structure is a lot of standing water.
This space will be off-limits to humans once the crossing is completed, with locked gates to keep people out and discreet fencing to guide wildlife away from nearby homes into the wild hills beyond. The crossing is designed to feel like an extension of the hills and valleys in the area to re-create the seamless corridor that existed before the noisy, busy freeway made passage so dangerous.
Once the gravel is in place, the builders will add about 6,000 cubic yards of “engineered soil” to the structure, Rock said. It’s a sandy loam mixed with lightweight volcanic aggregate to provide the volume and moisture needed to support plant life while reducing the weight on the structure and allowing for easy drainage.
That quantity of soil is enough to cover three-quarters of an American football field in about 2.5 feet of soil, he said, but on the crossing, the “ground” will be higher in some places than others, contoured to mimic the dips and dents one might find on nearby hills.
The engineered soil will also be inoculated with mycorrhizal fungi spores collected within  five miles of the crossing, the same spores added to the soils growing the 5,000-plus hyper-local native shrubs and wildflowers that will be planted on the crossing. The plants are considered “hyper-local” because they are grown from seeds that were collected within a five-mile radius of the structure, Rock said.
“We’ve got to have the right microbes in order for these locally sourced seeds to flourish,” said Ted Hartsig, a soil scientist for the engineering company Olsson, one of many contractors working on the crossing.
If all this sounds a little fiddly, well, just understand that it’s tough to mimic Mother Nature. Success is in the details, and there are more than a 100 people led by Rock trying to ensure that every detail is done correctly.
After all the soil is in place, they plan to start planting early next spring, Rock said. The project has two nursery sites now: a seed bank near Paramount Ranch and the main nursery off Las Virgenes Road in Calabasas, where thousands of seeds have been planted in tiny flats and then repotted to grow large enough to be planted.
Those seeds were collected in 2022 by the nursery’s former manager, Katherine Pakradouni, who has since moved on to another position. The people who helped her set up the nursery, Jewlya Samaniego and Jose Campos, now run the site together and put in so many long hours that some people have questioned whether they live there. They don’t, Samaniego said laughing, but there are time it feels that way, especially during the heavy rains last winter and the scorching heat this summer.
Native plants don’t need much water once they’re established in the ground, but growing in little pots that dry out quickly, that’s another matter, Campos said. During the highest heat, they had to water the plants twice a day to keep them  alive, and they finally created a shaded area to protect tender seedlings from  the heat.
Most of the plants growing at the nursery  will be planted on the structure next year: native shrubs such as white sage, California fuchsia, California buckwheat, sagebrush, purple sage, black sage, toyon and laurel sumac, along with a variety of native grasses.
The hope is that the plants will be robust enough — thanks to the beneficial microbes — to crowd out the black mustard and other invasive plants growing nearby, Rock said. Once established, the plants shouldn’t need much water, but the crossing will have an irrigation system installed that can be activated to wet down the crossing in the event of a wildfire.
Stage 2 involves creating a tunnel over Agoura Road to the south to create a gradual slope that will allow animals to wander off the crossing into the Santa Monica Mountains. To the north, a deep gash in the hill will also be filled with soil, to create a sloping entry from the Simi Hills onto the crossing.
Those areas will have similar plantings along with native oaks and other native trees, which can’t be planted on the crossing because their roots run too deep, Rock said.
The nursery is growing those plants from seed too. The plants have been moved to the growing area called the “seed bank” near Paramount Ranch, he said. The goal is to collect seeds from them until they’re ready to be moved to their permanent homes on the shoulders that link the crossing to the hills, which likely won’t be until 2026.
Rock said they’re doing the planting in stages so the plants on the crossing have a year to get established before wildlife can reach them. Otherwise, the young plants could be nibbled to death by hungry travelers.
The design work for Stage 2 is nearly completed, Rock said, but it will likely take a good part of 2025 to get the tunnel over Agoura Road completed.
Then there will be lots of earth to move. Much will come from the north side of the crossing, where fill dirt was deposited from the 101 expansion in the 1950s and 1960s, said Rock.
The shoulders will have to be filled in slowly, a little at a time on each side, said Vargas. Too much soil on one side could destabilize the structure, causing it to topple, he said, “which would be really, really sad.”
Once the fill soil is in place, the builders will add a final layer of top soil, a rich mix that was dredged from the bottom of Malibu Lake 70 years ago and has been resting near Paramount Ranch ever since, teeming with the beneficial microbes so important to this project’s success.
All that won’t happen for another year at least. On Oct. 16, the only animals on the structure were human, but high above, circling in the brilliant blue sky, a hawk was keeping tabs.

"Evacuation warnings lifted in Riverside County, as wildfire is partially contained",https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2024-11-29/evacuation-warnings-lifted-in-riverside-county-as-wildfire-is-contained,2024-11-30,"Officials lifted evacuation warnings as firefighters made some progress containing a wildfire near the Jurupa Valley that ignited Thanksgiving Day.
By Saturday, the Canyon Crest fire had spread to about 284 acressince it was first reportedsouth of the Riverside and San Bernardino county line,according to Cal Fire.
More than 200 firefighters have battled the blaze, which is now 50% contained, officials said. Containment refers to what portion of a wildfire’s perimeter has been surrounded by a natural or human-made control line.
The progress led officials to cancel evacuation warnings in Jurupa Valley. The cause of the fire remains under investigation.

State releases new plan to protect Joshua trees,https://www.latimes.com/environment/story/2024-11-28/this-new-coalition-is-dedicated-to-protecting-joshua-trees,2024-11-28,"The Joshua tree is cherished for its distinctive silhouette and singular role as a linchpin of the Mojave Desert ecosystem. Yet the iconic succulent is losing suitable habitat at a brisk clip due to climate change, worsening wildfires and development, scientists and environmental advocates say.
A new plan by the California Department of Fish and Wildlife to ensure the Joshua tree’s survival calls for limiting development in certain areas, including those where the plant may be able to thrive in a future anticipated to be warmer and drier, even as other portions of its range become uninhabitable.
Thedraft planalso calls on government agencies to develop strategies to mitigate and fight wildfires that threaten Joshua trees.
“It’s groundbreaking in that it’s really the most comprehensive attempt done by the state of California or really any entity I’m aware of in the United States on how to manage a species that’s clearly threatened by climate change,” said Brendan Cummings, conservation director of the Center for Biological Diversity.
The nonprofit petitioned to list the western Joshua tree as threatened under the state Endangered Species Act in 2019.
The plan does not spell out exactly how much land should be prioritized for protection, or where it is. But it lists criteria for ranking its conservation value, like having a high density of healthy Joshua trees and existing within an area where conditions are cooler and wetter than much of the rest of the range. It sets a goal of identifying priority conservation areas by December 2025, and protecting 70% of these areas by 2033.
The plan also recommends introducing Joshua tree populations with genetic variations that make them more resilient to climate change into these areas, said Drew Kaiser, senior environmental scientist at the Department of Fish and Wildlife. That strategy, called assisted gene flow, can be accomplished by planting seeds or seedlings, or by relocating mature trees, he said.
Much of the western Joshua tree’s range is federal land, so the state will have to work across jurisdictions to effectively protect it, Kaiser said. Multiple federal agencies have shown interest in establishing conservation agreements under which they’d adopt the management actions suggested in the plan, which also include minimizing harms from wildfire, grazing, offroading and pesticide use, he said.
Cummings said the effectiveness of the plan will depend on how it’s implemented.
To that end, a new coalition of nonprofits and government agencies has formed to foster collaboration among the many researchers, land managers and tribes working to conserve Joshua trees, with the help of $1.4 million in seed money from California’s Wildlife Conservation Board. The coalition will be instrumental in carrying out the plan’s goals, Kaiser said.
More than a third of the western species’ range in California is private land and includes some of the fastest-growing communities in the region, Kaiser said. Large-scale renewable energy projects havebulldozed thousands of Joshua treesat a time.
“The Joshua tree is widespread and abundant now, but you have all these pressures with development, with wildfire and then, on top of that, climate change,” Kaiser said. “That really is a death-by-a-thousand-cuts kind of situation.”
The conservation plan was mandated bya law that enacted last yearafter the California Fish and Game Commissiondeadlocked on whether to declare the species threatened. The Western Joshua Tree Conservation Act also requires developers to obtain permits and pay fees to kill, damage or remove Joshua trees. That money is earmarked for a conservation fund to purchase and conserve suitable habitat.
The law drew criticism from some high desert politicians, who feared it would drive up the cost of living in some of the last affordable regions in Southern California.
Both the conservation act and the potential listing under the state endangered species act were opposed by the San Bernardino County Board of Supervisors, whose representatives said either move would discourage economic investment in Mojave Desert communities.
In a letter sent last year to the state Senate and Assembly budget committees, Supervisor Dawn Rowe pointed out that there are tens of millions of western Joshua trees over a range of roughly 5,300 square miles and said the species “is abundant, widespread, and is in no danger of extinction.” State biologists had alsorecommended againstdesignating the western Joshua tree as threatened, saying concerns about the effects of climate change were premature.
Assemblyman Tom Lackey (R-Palmdale) grew up in the desert town of Boron and appreciates Joshua trees as “part of the culture of desert existence,” he said.
But he thinks the conservation law goes too far in the fees it imposes on developers.
“For our communities to survive, we have to figure out a way to balance environmental stewardship with economic development,” he said, recalling a recent project in which a Lancaster high school sought to build new athletic facilities and learned the cost would increase by $200,000 due to the removal of Joshua trees on-site.
“It seems like the Joshua tree has become somewhat of an ATM for government officials,” he said.
Even though the Joshua tree is currently ubiquitous, climate models clearly show there won’t be much suitable habitat left by the end of the century, Kaiser said. The conservation plan states that just 23.4% of the western Joshua tree’s range in California falls into the category of predicted climate refugia — places where the species will be able to continue to survive as conditions get hotter and drier — and that’s under a modeling scenario in which carbon emissions remain lower than many expect.
Many of these cooler, higher-elevation areas that are expected to have the most hospitable climate are also susceptible to wildfires because they tend to have denser vegetation, he added. Two large wildfireshave killed an estimated 1.8 million Joshua treesin and around the Mojave National Preserve since 2020.
Kelly Herbinson, executive director of the Mojave Desert Land Trust, said the idea for the Joshua tree coalition was inspired by the Giant Sequoia Lands Coalition, which was similarly born out of concern for a tree that serves as the namesake of a national park and isunder threatfrom climate change and habitat loss.
“We won’t be able to protect them once there’s few of them left — we have to be thinking about it from a proactive approach,” she said.
The conservation nonprofit convened the coalition, which includes representatives from the Native American Land Conservancy, California Department of Fish and Wildlife, National Park Service and other federal agencies.
Climate & Environment
As Joshua trees struggle with climate change, habitat loss and increasingly intense wildfires, California is scrambling to complete a conservation plan.
California’s Wildlife Conservation Board provided $1.4 million in seed funding to build the coalition and launch a massive statewide monitoring effort led by scientists at the U.S. Geological Survey. Dozens of biologists will fan out across the western Joshua tree’s range and take measurements from each population to assess how the plants are doing, with the goal of returning every seven years to measure changes over time. They expect to start early next year and have results wrapped up in late 2026, Herbinson said.
The coalition partners plan to work on strategic land protection by identifying climate refugia and protecting those areas from development.
The Native American Land Conservancy will ensure the many Indigenous groups on whose ancestral land Joshua trees grow will have a seat at the table, said Elizabeth Paige, education and stewardship program manager of the nonprofit and a member of the Torres Martinez Band of Desert Cahuilla Indians.
“We hold thousands of years of hypotheses being tested and knowledge being bestowed from generation to generation — that’s how we learn history,” she said. “It’s a whole other level of holistic care of the environment.”

Mojave town protests solar energy project as crews chainsaw hundreds of protected Joshua trees
Joshua trees are two distinct species — eastern and western — that grow in California, Arizona, Nevada, Utah and Mexico. Across most of their range, they’re one of the few tall plants that provide shade and shelter.
Dozens of animals rely on them to survive. An estimated 25 bird species, including ladder-backed woodpeckers, loggerhead shrikes and western screech owls, nest in their trunks and branches. Desert night lizards sleep and forage beneath their fallen boughs. Yucca moth caterpillars, kangaroo rats and ground squirrels eat their seeds.

Strong Santa Ana winds bring wildfire danger to Southern California for New Year’s Eve,https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2024-12-30/strong-santa-ana-winds-bring-wildfire-danger-to-southern-california-for-new-years-eve,2024-12-30,"Santa Ana winds are expected to usher in dry wildfire conditions for Southern California on New Year’s Eve, according to the National Weather Service.
Temperatures are forecast to be in the upper 60s and low 70s on Tuesday for the Los Angeles metropolitan area, before cooling off to about 50 degrees by Tuesday night, said weather service meteorologist Ryan Kittell.
“It’ll be fairly chilly overnight,” he said. “If you’re doing anything outside, be sure to bring a jacket.”
A red flag warningis in effect for Tuesday and Wednesday for portions of Los Angeles and Ventura counties, the weather service said.
Winds are expected to peak Tuesday into Wednesday, with peak gusts around 30 to 45 mph over the mountains and hills, it said. Humidity levels are expected to be less than 10% in mountain elevations above 4,000 feet, with humidity  of about 8% to 20% in the lower mountain areas.
Lifestyle
The Mountain fire threatened SoCal’s premier iris growers, but both survived. December is prime time to plant these exotic flowers, plus a list of plant events.
Santa Ana winds last month helped propel theMountain fire, which razed 243 buildings and damaged dozens more in Camarillo and other communities in western Ventura County. It was the third most destructive wildfire in Southern California in a decade.
In the next couple of days, strong Santa Ana winds from Malibu blowing toward the Santa Monica Mountains and the San Fernando Valley are expected to bring gusts  of 20 to 30 mph, Kittell said. It’s not expected to be as windy in Pasadena, where the Rose Bowl game and the Rose Parade will take place New Year’s Day.
Kittell warned about the potential for wildfires due to the heavy winds and dry conditions, urging people to be extra careful with anything that could spark a fire.
“Don’t light fireworks in areas with a lot of trees and shrubs,” he added.

Inside the Grammy Awards’ response to the L.A. wildfires,https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/music/story/2025-01-31/grammys-2025-los-angeles-wildfires-harvey-mason-jr-ben-winston,2025-02-01,"As soon as Harvey Mason Jr. was convinced that firefighters had gotten a handle on  this month’s devastating Los Angeles wildfires, the head of the Recording Academy turned his mind to a somewhat less dramatic matter.
Hotel rooms.
“I know that sounds weird,” said Mason, whose organization’s biggest event — the annual Grammy Awards ceremony recognizing the best in pop music — was just weeks away when local officials assured him that moving forward would be safe. “But if we’re having people fly into the city for our show, are we gonna be displacing people who need rooms because they lost their homes?”
To find out, Mason began working the phones, soliciting input from L.A.’s tourism department and from hotels including the JW Marriott next door to downtown’s Crypto.com Arena, where the 67th Grammys will be held Sunday night with nominees, presenters and performers including Beyoncé, Taylor Swift,Billie Eilish,Sabrina Carpenter, Herbie Hancock, Shakira, Charli XCX, Doechii, John Legend,Chappell Roanand Kendrick Lamar.
Music
Mikael Wood and August Brown were at Inglewood’s Intuit Dome and Kia Forum for the FireAid benefit concerts starring Billie Eilish, Lady Gaga, Green Day and Stevie Wonder, among many others.
“I also called the guy who manages the Beverly Hills Hotel, which I thought was probably a place where a lot of people from our industry go,” Mason recalled. “He said, ‘We’re at below 30% occupancy. Everyone on the outside feels like the city’s shut down and everything’s burning and we’re out of business. Weneedpeople to come.’ ”
For the Recording Academy, Sunday’s show — set to be broadcast live on CBS and streamed on Paramount+ — isn’t just an opportunity to reveal who won record of the year and who was named best new artist. It’s also a crucial gig for the 6,500 people the academy says the Grammys employ in Los Angeles: dancers and drivers and caterers and stagehands, many of whom have yet to recover from the economic stresses of the COVID-19 pandemic and the Hollywood strikes.
Just as important, in Mason’s view, is the chance to use the telecast and its associated events to aid in fire relief. Already, the academy says it’s distributed north of $4 million to more than 2,000 music professionals affected by the wildfires; the TV show itself will feature appeals to donate to MusiCares, the academy’s philanthropic arm, as well as to groups providing relief throughout Southern California.
Mason said those considerations outweighed his concerns about “the optics” of essentially throwing a party at a moment when thousands of Angelenos have seen their homes or business destroyed.
“People in the business were concerned about: If we do this, are we gonna look bad?” he said. (Indeed, music companies like Spotify and Universal Music Group called off their annual Grammy-week parties.) “But to me, canceling does the opposite of what needs to happen,” Mason added. “We need to raise money, we need to raise awareness and we need to show a unity around our community and around the city of L.A. — that we’re going through a hardship but we’ll bounce back.”
Music
The 67th Grammy Awards take place Sunday in Los Angeles. Check out our picks for album of the year, record of the year and other top categories.
Striking the right tone for the show “is a high-wire act, there’s no question,” says Ben Winston, one of the Grammys’ executive producers along with Raj Kapoor and Jesse Collins. Winston has experience in that effort: In 2021 he and his team designed the telecast around COVID-19 restrictions that had pop stars in masks; in 2022 they mounted the show just a week after Will Smith shocked the world by slapping Chris Rock at the Oscars.
Until 2023, Winston ran James Corden’s CBS late-night show, which he called “an hour of fun and silliness” that frequently ran up against the real world. “A natural disaster or a school shooting happens right before you go on, and you’ve got this superstar dancing in the street. We got very used to saying: ‘Is that appropriate? How do we get there?’ ”
Sunday’s show will honor firefighters and other first responders and showcase impacted small-business owners; it will also “celebrate the spirit of the city of Los Angeles,” according to Winston, including several performances “that didn’t exist before the fires,” he said. “There’s a couple of artists who called afterwards and said, ‘I was gonna singthis, but how would you guys feel if I now sangthat?’ ”
There’s also a tribute planned to Quincy Jones, the hugely influential music figure who died at 91 in November. Said Kapoor of the segment: “It’s maybe a little bigger than what we would normally do. The entire Grammy show could actually be Quincy because of how many genres he touched and how much work he accomplished and the love of the industry for him.”
Music
Ahead of Sunday’s 67th Grammys, here’s a ranked list of all 66 songs that have won record of the year since the Recording Academy’s first ceremony in 1959.
One element the showwon’tinclude, Winston said, is a performance by Kendrick Lamar of “Not Like Us,” the Grammy-nominated diss track that capped Lamar’s epic feud last year with Drake. Lamar is scheduled to headline the Super Bowl halftime show on Feb. 9, “and the NFL always make their Super Bowl halftime performers sign a deal that says they’re not allowed to perform anywhere for a matter of weeks,” Winston said. “We’ve never had a Super Bowl performer on the Grammys. That’s the NFL’s call, it’s not the artist’s.” (Winston did promise that the show would contain “a couple of surprises.”)
Ratings of the previous two telecasts were both up significantly, but Winston expects numbers to be down this year, in part because the show’s marketing campaign was narrowed to just over a week in length, compared to the usual month.
“I was very passionate about the show happening,” Winston said, “but what we weren’t comfortable with while people were evacuating was: ‘Hey, watch the Grammys!’ ”
Mason didn’t seem worried by the prospect of a ratings dip, though he also knows that viewership matters — particularly this year.
“The reason we give these awards is so that we can have a broadcast, and the reason we have a broadcast is so we can have a licensing fee come in the door that goes back out to serve music people,” he said. “There’s no greater example of that than this fire and this show.
“Whoever wins a Grammy on this telecast is gonna be directly tied to the people who get help from the money that comes in from the show.”

These 24 Angeles National Forest trails and campgrounds are closed following the Eaton fire,https://www.latimes.com/lifestyle/story/2025-01-31/angeles-national-forest-trails-campground-closures-eaton-fire,2025-01-31,"Much of Angeles National Forest reopened Thursday after a weeks-long closure because of wildfires and red flag warnings, but some beloved trails and campgrounds will remain inaccessible while the land recovers from the blazes.
The areas that burned in theEaton firein January andBridge firein September will remain closed, anareathat makes up about 17% of the 700,000-acre forest. Both fires’ closure orders are set to expire Dec. 31, 2025, although the U.S. Forest Service has the authority to extend those orders if necessary.
One of the biggest losses to L.A’s outdoors community is the closure of trails inBig Santa Anita Canyon, which had only just reopened in October after being closed for four years. The Bobcat fire raged through the area in 2020, andvolunteer crewsspent hundreds of hours rebuilding trails, including the path to the serene 55-foot Sturtevant Falls.
TheChantry Flat Recreation Areain Big Santa Anita Canyon is technically open, but because of the Eaton fire, the Los Angeles County Public Works has temporarily closed the county-managed section of roadway that leads visitors into the area. This cuts off access to the charmingAdams Pack Station(and its famous donkey herd) andSturtevant Camp. Staff at Adams Pack Station weretoldit could be three or four months before the road reopens, according to the store’s Instagram page.
Several miles of hiking and popular mountain biking trails remain closed, including much of theGabrielino National Recreation Trail, a 28.8-mile tree-lined treasure popular among hikers, backpackers, horseback riders and mountain bikers.
Here is what is closed in Angeles National Forest because of the Eaton fire. The Times previously reported on the26 trailsthat burned in the Eaton fire and the25 trailsthat burned in the Bridge fire.

Drone pilot to plead guilty in collision that grounded aircraft fighting Palisades fire,https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2025-01-31/la-me-drone-pilot-palisades-fire-feds-guilty-plea,2025-01-31,"A man who was piloting a drone that collided with a firefighting aircraft working on the Palisades fire has agreed to plead guilty to a misdemeanor, pay a fine and complete community service, federal prosecutors said Friday.
Peter Tripp Akemann, 56, of Culver City was charged with unsafe operation of an unmanned aircraft. He could still face up to a year in federal prison, prosecutors said.
The drone, which authorities say was flying in restricted airspace on Jan. 9, put a fist-sized hole in the left wing of a Super Scooper — a massive fixed-wing plane that can drop large amounts of water onto a fire. The collision knocked theplane out of commissionfor about five days and destroyed the drone.
“Like a lot of individuals, he was curious about what was happening in that area,” acting U.S. Atty. Joseph T. McNally said on Friday. “The problem with that... is with the amount of firefighting planes you have in that area dropping so they can get water in the Pacific Ocean it interferes with those operations. It’s not the time to fly drones anytime that we have these emergencies in Southern California.”
As part of the plea agreement, Akemann agreed to pay full restitution to the government of Quebec, Canada, which supplied the plane, and the company that repaired the plane. It cost at least $65,169 to fix the aircraft, prosecutors said.
Akemann also agreed to complete 150 hours of community service in support of wildfire relief efforts.
Attorneys Glen T. Jonas and Vicki Podberesky, who are representing Akemann, said in a statement that their client is “deeply sorry for the mistake he made.”
“He accepts responsibility for his grave error in judgment, and is cooperating with the government in effort to make amends,” the attorneys wrote.
Akemann appeared in court in downtown Los Angeles on Friday afternoon and was released on a $15,000 bond.
In the plea agreement, Akemann admitted to launching a DJI Mini 3 Pro unmanned aircraft from the top floor of a parking structure at the Third Street Promenade in Santa Monica and flying it toward Pacific Palisades to observe the damage caused by the fire. He flew the drone about 1.5 miles before losing sight of it.
Prosecutors said the drone then collided with the Super Scooper carrying two crewmembers. McNally said in an interview that authorities suspect the impact occurred over the ocean where planes often pick up water during firefighting missions.
Maintenance crews located “drone wreckage” in parts of the plane and used that material to help identify the owner of the drone, McNally said.
Akemann’s attorneys said their client was relying on the DJI Drone’s geofencing safeguard feature, which they allege failed to work. The feature, which has been on DJI drones for more than 10 years, was created as a safety mechanism to prevent consumer drone operators from unintentionally flying in restricted airspace.
On Jan. 13 — four days after the crash in Los Angeles — thecompany announcedit was dropping geofence restrictions on most of its consumer and enterprise drone products in the United States. Representatives for DJI could not immediately be reached for comment on Friday.
The wind-driven Palisades fire raged for days in Pacific Palisades and surrounding communities, burning 23,400 acres, killing 12 people and destroying more than 6,800 properties, according to the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection.
Temporary flight restrictions were put in place across portions of Southern California as the firestorms tore through Los Angeles County. Those restrictions mean that all aircraft not involved in wildfire suppression operations have to get permission to enter the airspace. Officials said no permission had been given at the time the drone collided with the plane.
FBI Assistant Director Akil Davis said there is no evidence that the drone was intentionally flown into the aircraft, but it’s an inherent risk when piloting one in a restricted area.
“Going forward, we’re going to be dealing with more drones, and the likelihood of a disastrous result will increase,” Davis said.
Drones flying in the fire zone were a persistent problem as firefighters battled the Palisades fire. Aerial footage of the devastation wrought by the blaze went viral on social media, but was frequently criticized by officials and others who said the drones that captured the images were jeopardizing the fire fight.
The collision — and the flouting of the flight restriction by others — prompted the Federal Aviation Administration to issue a stern warning against flying drones near wildfires.
“It’s a federal crime, punishable by up to 12 months in prison, to interfere with firefighting efforts on public lands,” the FAA said. “Additionally, the FAA can impose a civil penalty of up to $75,000 against any drone pilot who interferes with wildfire suppression, law enforcement or emergency response operations” during a temporary flight restriction.
Drones flying in wildfire zones has been an issue for the FAA and fire officials for at least a decade.
In 2019, the U.S. Forest Service reported there were at least 20 unauthorized drone flights over or near wildfires in seven states, including California. Flights resulted in aerial firefighting operations being temporarily shut downnine times that year, according to the forest service.
“As this case demonstrates, we will track down drone operators who violate the law and interfere with the critical work of our first responders,” McNally said.
Meanwhile, officials are continuing to probe the cause of the Palisades fire.
The U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives has spent weeks scouring a hiking trail and hillside where they suspect the fire started, breaking it down into a grid. They have examined 250 leads, obtained 90 hours of relevant video and conducted 50 interviews.
From the beginning, there has been speculation an 8-acre blaze that fire officials thought they had put out on Jan. 1 in the same area reignited and spread because of intense winds, or a new fire was somehow sparked nearby that morning.
But sources saidthis weekno conclusion had been made.

California’s monarch butterfly population plummets; fire wipes out Topanga habitat,https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2025-01-31/california-monarch-butterfly-population-hits-alarming-low-fire-wipes-out-topanga-habitat,2025-01-31,"The Western population of the monarch butterfly has declined to a near-record low with fewer than 10,000 found living in California this winter, a foreboding sign for the future of the beloved black-and-orange insect.
Anannual countrecorded 9,119 butterflies this winter, according to results released by theXerces Society for Invertebrate Conservation. This is the second-lowest population recorded since tracking began in 1997. An all-time low of fewer than 2,000 monarchs was recorded in 2020.
The society said these numbers underscored the importance of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service’s new proposal to list the butterfly as a federally endangered species.
Climate & Environment
Federal wildlife officials on Tuesday proposed protecting the striking long-distance migrators under the Endangered Species Act after dramatic population drops.
The butterfly’s Western population has plummeted more than 95% since the 1980s, when as many as 4 million butterflies were estimated to spend winter in California, according to the California Department of Fish and Wildlife. Without urgent conservation efforts, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service estimates that the Western population faces a 99% chance of extinction by 2080.
Habitat destruction, pesticides and extreme weather fluctuation due to climate change are to blame for the butterfly’s decline.
This year’s particularly poor showing can also be attributed to an usually hot and dry fall, which probably slowed butterfly breeding and the metamorphosis of caterpillars into butterflies, said Emma Pelton, an endangered species biologist with the Xerces Society.
The recent Los Angeles-area wildfires damaged tree groves where these butterflies live, including a habitat in Lower Topanga Canyon where more than 100 butterflies were recorded in last year’s count, she said. Another alarming finding was made at a site in Santa Barbara County, where only 198 were recorded this year after 33,200 monarchs were found there last winter.
The count is conducted by about 400 volunteers at 257 sites along California’s coastline and Baja California, Mexico, where the Western monarch population gathers to pass winter before fanning out across the West from Arizona to Idaho in spring.
The Eastern monarch population — which has decreased more than 80% since the 1980s — spends winters in the mountains of central Mexico and warm months in the eastern half of the United States, according to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service.
This year’s Western monarch count marks a sharp decline from the last three years, when more than 200,000 Western monarchs were recorded each year, thanks, in part, to more favorable weather conditions, Pelton said. But even counts in the 200,000 range mark a dangerous decrease from the millions of butterflies observed in the 1980s that scientists considered a stable population level.
“Insect populations commonly fluctuate from year to year,” according to theCalifornia Department of Fish and Wildlife. “The overall downward trend remains concerning, particularly if the threats are not ameliorated.”
The monarch butterfly was first petitioned to be listed under the federal Endangered Species Act in 2014, but that effort was shelved due to more urgent population priorities. In December, the U.S. agency released aproposalto list the butterfly as an endangered species.
“The iconic monarch butterfly is cherished across North America, captivating children and adults throughout its fascinating lifecycle. Despite its fragility, it is remarkably resilient, like many things in nature when we just give them a chance,” Martha Williams, then-director of the Fish and Wildlife Service, said in a December statement. “Science shows that the monarch needs that chance.”
The service also has proposed designating 4,395 acres as critical habitat for the Western monarch population across Alameda, Marin, Monterey, San Luis Obispo, Santa Barbara, Santa Cruz and Ventura counties to help support population regrowth.
The agency will be acceptingpublic commentson the proposed threatened species designation until March 12 and make a final decision by the end of the year.
In addition to supporting the designation, the Xerces Society is urging the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency to take into account theeffect of pesticides on butterfliesbefore approving the products for market. Currently, the only insect included in the EPA’s required pesticide testing is the adult honeybee.
Testing by the Xerces Society and the University of Nevada in Reno in 2019 found that milkweed leaves, the main food source for the monarch caterpillar, were contaminated by 64 pesticides. One of these pesticides, methoxyfenozide, was found in 96% of milkweed samples, but it is allowed to be used under current pesticide regulations because it is not toxic to bees.
“We know pesticides are a key driver of monarch and other pollinator declines. Yet there are glaring gaps in the EPA’s oversight of pesticides: the vast majority of pesticides have never been tested for their impacts on butterflies,” Rosemary Malfi, director of conservation policy at the Xerces Society, said in a statement. “How can we protect these essential species if we’re missing the basic information needed to make better decisions?”

Three atmospheric river storms are headed for California. Will one be enough to end SoCal’s devastating fire season?,https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2025-01-31/atmospheric-river-storms-los-angeles-rain,2025-02-02,"After an extraordinarily dry start to the year, three atmospheric river storms are expected to hit California over the next week — with one of them potentially bringing much-needed moisture to the still-withered Southland while packing a more powerful and prolonged punch up north.
The latest forecasting models are predicting rain totals will generally not exceed 1½ inches for much of Los Angeles County, though some areas could see considerably less. Such a soaking would benefit vegetation parched by a historically dry start to the water year and has the potential to finally end one of SouthernCalifornia’s most destructive wildfire seasons.
This week’s storms coupled with the last — which dropped a half an inch to 1½ inches across the L.A. Basin last weekend — could near a total above 2 inches of rain for the season. Experts say it will take 2 to 4 inches  over the region to comfortably consider the wildfire season over.
“It could get us close to that,” said Bryan Lewis, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service office in Oxnard. “There’s still somewhat of a range of outcomes [for rain totals]. ... It might not be widespread enough.”
Though that last storm, L.A.’s first major rainfall of the season, did ease some immediate fire threats, it didn’t quite pack the punch to finally mitigate lingering wildfire concerns. Downtown Los Angeles received a total of 0.54 of an inch of rain during that storm.
That rainfall also didn’t make a dent in worsening drought conditions across Southern California, which have only intensified over the last few weeks, according to the latest report from the U.S. Drought Monitor.
At the end of December, much of Southern California hadswung toward drought conditionsfor the first time in years, but the last few weeks have elevated those concerns, with much of L.A. County now considered in “severe” or “extreme” drought conditions. The only category worse is “exceptional” drought.
Thestate’s latest snow survey on Fridayalso found that the state’s snowpack has fallen well below average for this time of year, after a relatively dry January statewide.
Though the conditions may be concerning — drought monitor officials note that the area is seeing “significant short-term drought” that has intensified without considerable rainfall — the previous two wet years mean that the region’s water systems are not yet strained.
And these latest measurements are also nowhere near as dire as they were during the years-long drought that stretched through much of the early 2010s. In January 2015, almost the entire state was considered in extreme or exceptional drought; currently, just 11% of California has reached those levels.
However, the U.S. Drought Monitor report released Thursday did show drought conditions have extended into much of Central California and across the state’s major agricultural valleys, where “the water year has continued to be drier than normal,”the latest analysis said.
There’s a chance next week’s storms could help.
Moderate to heavy rainfall is forecast in Los Angeles and Ventura counties from Tuesday through Friday, according to the weather service office. It could rain for many hours each day, with the highest chance of precipitation between Tuesday afternoon and Wednesday afternoon in Ventura, and Thursday into Friday in L.A.
Rose Schoenfeld, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service office in Oxnard, said  rainfall will stem from one of the atmospheric rivers moving in from the north, followed by a second storm currently brewing off the coast, which is expected to hit Los Angeles County Thursday night.
However, forecasters warned that these rains could bring a minor-to-moderate risk for debris flows and mudslides in some of the recent burned areas, such as around the Palisades and Eaton fires in Los Angeles County — a concern that wasmostly alleviated during last weekend’s winter storm.
The wildfires have made soils repellent to water, and during heavy rains, water can easily flow across burn scars and pick up rocks, branches and sometimes massive boulders, sending debris flowing downhill quickly — with destructive and deadly consequences.
“There is some risk … there is likely to be a good amount of areas that will see periods of [rain falling at a rate of] a half inch an hour, and that is the threshold for debris flows,” Schoenfeld said. “So we may see some impacts with this storm.”
Under the most likely scenario, L.A. County could see a quarter of an inch to an inch of rain from Tuesday to Thursday, followed by as much as an inch Thursday night into Friday morning.
But there’s also a worst-case scenario, where downtown L.A., Long Beach and Redondo Beach could get more than 1.6 inches of rain, and Santa Clarita more than 1.8 inches, Santa Barbara more than 3 inches and Cambria nearly 4 inches.
But with the storm still far enough out, there’s also an underperforming scenario, where downtown L.A. could get one-third of an inch of rain. Both the worst-case and “low amount” scenarios have a 10% to 20% chance of occurring, forecasters said Friday.
The chance of rain is lower in the Inland Empire and San Diego and Orange counties. The National Weather Service said there was a slight chance of rain in that region on Tuesday and also on Wednesday.
There are chances of light rain in Santa Barbara and San Luis Obispo counties from Friday night through Monday. From Tuesday through Thursday, those counties have a 30% chance of high amounts of rain, and a 50% chance of moderate rainfall.
Wide swaths of Southern California have seen only one significant rainstorm in more than eight months — producing for many areas a record dry start to the water year, which began Oct. 1. In the lead-up to the Palisades and Eaton fires this month, the intense dryness kept vegetation tinder dry — a recipe for disaster when combined with strong Santa Ana winds and an ignition source.
Northern California did have a wet start to the rainy season but also experienced a dry January. After the area enjoyed robust rain in November and December, when precipitation in the Sierra Nevada was above average, precipitation there is now merely average.
The northern Sierra, for instance, has had 26.5 inches of cumulative precipitation. That’s 98% of the average for this date, but it’s the first time in months the region has dipped below 100%. The northern Sierra is a key piece of the state’s water supply, which relies on a natural reservoir of snow and ice in the mountains that slowly melts to refill reservoirs in the spring, summer and fall.
January is not quite over yet, but so far, downtown San Francisco has endured its third-driest January on record, with just 0.19 of an inch of rain so far this month, according to Nicole Sarment, a meteorologist with the weather service’s office in Monterey. That’s just 4% of the city’s average January rainfall of 4.4 inches.
But that dry spell looks set to end — and not with a whimper.
Northern California is primed to get three atmospheric river storms, according to Courtney Carpenter, a meteorologist with the weather service’s Sacramento office. Atmospheric river storms are long plumes of water vapor that can pour over from the Pacific Ocean into California. They carry so much water that they’re said to be like a river in the sky. Just a few atmospheric river events can bring California from one-third to one-half of its annual precipitation.
The first storm for Northern California started arriving Friday and could last through Sunday, with a second arriving Monday and a third not far behind on Wednesday, Carpenter said.
The first storm will probably bring accumulating snowfall to just the higher Sierra peaks, according to the weather service office in Reno. The second is expected to be colder, potentially bringing heavier mountain snow and more widely affecting travel, Carpenter said.
In the Sacramento Valley, given the dry weather, “we’re not expecting widespread major flooding impacts across our area, but do look for extended periods of moderate, heavy rain, significant rises on area waterways ... localized flooding in our usual trouble spots, and the potential for mud and rockslides in the mountains and foothills below the snow line,” Carpenter said.
Sacramento could get 2 to 3 inches of rain during this weekend’s storm, and Donner Peak could see 6 to 8 inches of snow. Sacramento could see another 2 to 3 inches of rain during next week’s storm, with potentially another 30 to 36 inches of snow falling at Donner Peak.
The area of the 429,603-acre Park fire, which burned through Butte and Tehama counties north of Chico, is not expected to see intense enough rainfall to trigger debris flows, Carpenter said, but “you can expect increased muddy and woody runoff,” which occurred in northern Chico neighborhoods in November.
At least six days of rain are expected for the San Francisco Bay Area and surrounding areas, and there could be moderate effects  in San Francisco, the North Bay and San Mateo County, as well as in Santa Cruz and San Benito counties.
The Bay Area has a better-than-even chance of 1 inch of rain for the first atmospheric river storm, hitting Friday through Sunday. More significant rainfall is expected next week.
The “main question is timing and extent of moderate-to-heavy rainfall,” the weather service office in Monterey said, which could cause elevated levels of water in creeks and streams and minor street flooding.

L.A. County had extra firefighters ready. How many were near Altadena?,https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2025-01-30/l-a-county-had-extra-firefighters-ready-how-many-were-near-altadena,2025-01-31,"L.A. County Fire Chief Anthony Marrone woke up in his San Fernando Valley home Jan. 7 to a swimming pool filled with leaves and roof shingles.
Marrone’s chief deputy, Jon O’Brien, told his boss that his Sierra Madre house felt like it was “going to get blown off the foundation.”
Around 6:30 a.m., the two men consulted Windy, a forecast app popular with surfers and sailors, and made a “seat of the pants” call, Marrone recalled.
None of the 900 firefighters on duty would be going home. At 8 a.m., the next shift would join them.
That meant the county had about 1,800 firefighters available when a fire erupted in Pacific Palisades a few hours later — nearly double the manpower of the city Fire Department, which decided not to keep firefighters on for a second shift that morning.
“I think we viewed the risk differently” than L.A. city fire officials, Marrone said in an interview.
Marrone’s firefighters poured into Pacific Palisades that morning to assist the city, which had beencaught flatfootedafter staffing a fraction of its available engines amid a parched landscape and forecasts of life-threatening winds. Later in the afternoon as the fire spread, some county firefighters headed to neighboring Malibu and unincorporated areas.
California
Fire officials made the critical decision to forgo calling in scores of extra firefighters and equipment in the hours before the fire, according to internal documents reviewed by The Times.
“We doubled our workforce that morning, and we staffed every available piece of equipment,” said Marrone, whose department is responsible for fire protection across unincorporated parts of L.A. County as well as 60 cities.
But when the Eaton inferno began in the Altadena area, nearly eight hours later and 40 miles away, it’s unclear how many county firefighters were nearby to fight the flames. Many residents in West Altadena say they watched their houses burn with no fire engines in sight.
Firefighters who were already battling the Palisades fire stayed there, raising questions about how much Altadena suffered from the misfortune of being the second catastrophic blaze to break out that day.
Fred Fielding, a spokesperson for the department, said fire officials would release only personnel from a wildfire when the threat was receding.
“Anybody who showed up there was going to stay there,” he said of the Palisades fire. “They were working something like 36 hours straight.”
Three weeks later, Marrone said he did not know how many firefighters and engines were positioned at each fire on Jan. 7. He said his agency plans to do a breakdown of that day’s staffing.
“The second fire is always the hardest fire to staff — then when the third fire happens, oh, forget about it,” he said. “But we always keep people in reserve. We never say, ‘Oh, dump the whole county to the Palisades fire,’ because we always have to be prepared for the second fire.”
At 7:20 a.m. on Jan. 7 — 40 minutes before 800 L.A. County firefighters were supposed to go home from a 24-hour shift — an email went out telling them to stay. They would soon be joined by another 800 firefighters.
The combined force would staff all their usual engines, as well as smaller utility vehicles known as patrols and 42 “reserve apparatus,” typically used when front-line engines are out of service.
Others would staff  county strike teams positioned in Agoura Hills, La Cañada Flintridge and Pacoima. Two additional strike teams were in Santa Clarita, requested by county fire officials from the state that Sunday as wind forecasts grew more dire.
Around 10:30 a.m., the blaze started in Pacific Palisadesnear a popular hikingtrail.
L.A. Fire Chief Kristin Crowley “contacted us. ‘Hey, I need help. I got a bad fire,’” Marrone recalled.
Three of the county strike teams, each consisting of five engines, sprang toward the coast. Marrone said the county also dispatched a “first-alarm brush response” to the Palisades. At 6:09 p.m., three additional strike teams responded to the Palisades fire as it moved toward Topanga Canyon, according to a timeline provided by the county Fire Department.
Despite their efforts, the fire cut a destructive swath,killing 12 people.Almost 1,200 structures were destroyed in county areas and more than 4,500 in  the city of L.A., including Pacific Palisades and Brentwood, according to a Times analysis. The city areas were more densely populated and made up 60% of the fire’s footprint.
Marrone credited “personnel and our staffing” with limiting the damage in the county areas.
The first reports of the Eaton fire came in at 6:18 p.m. Radio transmissions show that county firefighters arrived quickly but were soon overwhelmed.
Altadena, which is an unincorporated part of the county, took an unimaginable hit. Most of the community was affected, with 9,400 structures lost. All 17 people who died were in areas of western Altadena that received evacuation ordershours after the fire started.
Some have asserted that there were not enough firefighters in the area that night. On social media and in interviews, West Altadena residents have expressed anger as they share stories from the hellish evening, with some claiming that the area was purposefully forgotten and others lamenting that it appeared resources were directed elsewhere.
California
As the Eaton fire spread, many areas were notified of evacuation warnings and orders well in advance. In the heart of Altadena, where all 17 reported deaths occurred, evacuation orders came hours after fire did.
“Why didn’t anyone help us?” said Jon Carmody, anAltadena Town Council memberwho represents a part of the westside where many residents say they watched their houses burn with no fire engines in sight.
The historically Black area, wheremany settledin decades past due to redlining east of Lake Avenue, “has definitely felt undervalued and overlooked in many ways,” Carmody said. “The fire made it more obvious.”
Others said the flames grew so big so fast, in a nighttime fire battle with powerful gusts scattering embers deep into neighborhoods, that no number of firefighters could have handled it.Fire expertshave saidthat even with more resources, the fast-moving, erratic blaze would have been impossible to fight, given the winds and the dry landscape.
“I don’t know if the firefighters would’ve been able to do anything because the fire was so massive,” said Salomon Huerta, a 59-year-old Altadena resident, who said he never saw any firefighters near his house on Krenz Avenue when he fled with his wife around 9 p.m. The whole block burned down.
Marrone said much of L.A. County Fire’s top brass sped to the Eaton fire as soon as it broke out. He headed from the Palisades fire to Eaton Canyon around 6:45 p.m. after being briefly stranded on the ember-filled Pacific Coast Highway due to a flat tire from a fallen utility pole.
Around that time, Marrone said, he asked the state’s Office of Emergency Services for 50 strike teams that could be distributed around L.A. County.
“I thought to myself, if I’ve over-ordered, I’m gonna seem foolish, right? Like, ‘Look at Marrone overreacting,’” he said.
“Nobody wants to be the boy who cried wolf,” he added. “But it didn’t work out that way.”
By the time the Eaton fire erupted, new county strike teams had been formed in La Cañada Flintridge, next to NASA’sJet Propulsion Laboratory— about seven miles away — and Pacoima, more than 20 miles away, to replace the teams dispatched to the Palisades. Those new teams were sent to the Eaton fire at 6:35 p.m. and 6:36 p.m., according to the county Fire Department.
Marrone said crews from county Fire Stations 11 and 12, both in Altadena, were also in the vicinity.
Pasadena city firefighters arrived at the fire at 6:27 p.m., less than 10 minutes after it was first reported. Firefighters from Station 66 near the bottom of Eaton Canyon, which was the closest county fire station, arrived a few minutes later.
As flames encroached on Station 66 at 7:06 p.m., firefighters asked for backup. A minute later, another fire official called for 20 fire engines and 10 strike teams.
“If we can get resources rolling here, that’s what I need right now,” the official said.
At 10:35 p.m., the Eaton incident command confirmed that 10 strike teams had been deployed to the fire, according to the county’s timeline.
It was too late — ferocious winds had scattered the embers. Firefighting aircraft that had been shifted from the Palisades fire to the Eaton fire were quickly grounded.
“I get asked that question all the time: Why didn’t you squirt the fire out?” Marrone said. “You add fire into Category 1 hurricane-force wind, you cannot put the fire out.”

‘We don’t want it!’ San Gabriel Valley rages against shipment of Eaton fire hazardous waste,https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2025-01-30/san-gabriel-valley-pushes-back-epa-hazardous-waste-eaton-fire,2025-01-31,"Hundreds of San Gabriel Valley residents confronted state and federal officials during a heated community meeting Wednesday, asking how a local recreation area had become a processing site forhazardous waste from the Eaton firewithout community input.
The Environmental Protection Agency began trucking hazardous waste 15 miles from the Altadena burn zone to Lario Park in Irwindale for sorting and storage on Monday. Officially known as the Lario Staging Area, the rocky area is owned by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and was leased until this month to the Los Angeles County parks department.
The 5-acre site is now home to workers in protective gear who are organizingpotentially hazardous household items— which can include paint, bleach, asbestos and lithium-ion batteries — that cannot be sent to landfills.
State Sen. Susan Rubio (D-Baldwin Park) and several local mayors said they learned about theEPA’s use of the Irwindale sitefrom news reports.
Residents of Duarte, Azusa and nearby cities said they were furious that they had not been notified that waste was arriving by truck at a site near a popular recreation area, which includes the San Gabriel River trail. Some said they were afraid that toxic chemicals or other fire debris would leach into the air, soil or water.

Nearly two weeks after the Eaton fire forced Claire Robinson to flee her Altadena home, she returned, donning a white hazmat suit, a respirator and goggles.
Officials from the EPA and the California agencies that handle environmental protection and toxic substances control assured residents they were taking safety precautions, but were repeatedly interrupted by audience members who yelled, “We don’t want it!” and “Find another place!”
“Once you have a community that’s that upset, it’s really hard to walk it back,” Rubio said.
At one point, a woman rose from her seat and asked whether officials would be comfortable sending their children to school near such a site.
Yes, said Katie Butler, the head of the state’s Department of Toxic Substances Control: “Hazardous waste sounds really scary because sometimes it is, and that’s why experts have to handle it properly.”
The EPA is working under a 30-day deadline to remove all hazardous waste from the Eaton and Palisades fire burn areas so that the Army Corps can safely clear the rubble, said Tara Fitzgerald, the agency’s incident commander.
Fitzgerald had toldfrustrated Pacific Palisades residentslast week that the process could take months.
The EPA was told, “by order of the White House,” to expedite the removal work to 30 days, Celeste McCoy, an on-scene coordinator for the EPA, said in testimony to the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors this week. McCoy said it’s likely that the cleanup will take less than six months, but that was an estimate.
“Again, this is kind of unknowable,” she said. “The scale of this is bigger than we’ve dealt with before.”
Rubio and several mayors, including Duarte’s Cesar Garcia, repeatedly pressed Fitzgerald about whether the 30-day deadline could be extended, or at least whether the EPA could move the disposal of lithium-ion batteries to another site.
“I don’t know that we can reassess the deadline,” Fitzgerald said.
Fitzgerald said the EPA chose the Irwindale site because it was big and flat enough to suit their needs, and because it was available. Other potential sites closer to the burn zone, including the Rose Bowl and Santa Anita Park, are being used for fire crews and relief efforts.
Household waste from the Palisades fire will be trucked to the site of the former Topanga Ranch Motel in Malibu. Fitzgerald said the EPA is looking at additional processing sites for both fires, including the Altadena Golf Course and the Irwindale Speedway.
Los Angeles County Supervisor Kathryn Barger recalled Tuesday that President Trump, who met with her and other local officials during his brief visit to Los Angeles last week, “said 30 days.”
“The EPA’s got to begin, like, yesterday,” Barger said.
The cleanup begins in the burn zone with EPA contractors in respirators, white suits and hard hats sifting through the rubble of homes and businesses.
Each material is placed in a container at the burn site, EPA spokesperson Anna Drabek said. Waste containing asbestos is sealed into two layers of polyurethane bags and then into a plastic container with a lid, she said, while liquids such as bleach and motor oil are poured into drums.
The items are loaded onto lined stake-bed trucks to be driven to Irwindale. The trucks stop multiple times inside the facility to drop off materials such as batteries, bleach and propane in separate areas of the  site, Drabek said.
“There’s nothing out in the open, no open bags, no dust, none of that,” Drabek said. “There are several layers between whatever is in the bags and the actual soil. At no point do we expect there to be contact with these materials.”
The waste won’t stay at the Lario site permanently. Drabek said that each type of material will be sent to a different permanent facility, and that the agency is looking for options in California and other states.
President Trump pushed local leaders to allow homeowners affected by the fires access to clear and clean their properties quickly. But is that putting speed ahead of consequences?
Fitzgerald said the EPA has installed liners to prevent toxic materials from leaching into the soil. She said the agency performed soil testing before beginning and will test the soil again before leaving.
The site also has eight air-quality monitors at the perimeter, Drabek said, and water trucks that spray three times daily to suppress dust.
After the2023 wildfires in Maui, Hawaii, the EPA trucked waste to a shooting range on the island about 10 miles from the burn zone. About 2,200 buildings were destroyed in that fire, and the EPA’s cleanup took about four months.
Jennifer Roman of Duarte attended the meeting with her sister-in-law and did not leave reassured. She said that she was worried that the waste was being trucked through more than a half-dozen cities to reach the site. The meeting was so raucous, she said, that it was hard to learn much about how residents or workers would be protected.
“I don’t know why we should trust them,” Roman said of the government agencies. “Don’t they always lie?”

Everything that happened at the FireAid benefit: From Stevie Nicks’ thank you to Lady Gaga’s hopeful closer,https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/music/story/2025-01-30/fireaid-benefit-concert-live-updates-kia-forum-intuit-dome,2025-01-31,"Less than three weeks after a series of historic wildfires killed 29 people and destroyed more than 16,000 structures in the Los Angeles area, more than two dozen of music’s biggest names  gathered for theFireAid benefit concert— “an evening of music and solidarity,” as organizers described it, meant to raise money for affected Angelenos and to “prevent future fire disasters throughout Southern California.”
In fact, FireAid encompassed two concerts — one held at Inglewood’s Intuit Dome and the other about a mile north at the Kia Forum.Billie Eilish, Green Day,Joni Mitchell, John Fogerty, Gracie Abrams, No Doubt, Jelly Roll and Stevie Nicks  were among the acts who’ve taken the stage. Katy Perry took the stage backed by the Pasadena Chorale, which lost its home base when the Altadena Community Church burned down. Some of its singers and its founding artistic director, Jeffrey Bernstein, lost homes in the fire.
The bill also included Olivia Rodrigo, Lady Gaga, Stevie Wonder, Peso Pluma andthe Red Hot Chili Peppers, among many others. Produced by a team of music-industry veterans led by Irving Azoff and his family, FireAid was    live-streamed on an array of platforms including Netflix, Hulu, Max, Apple TV+, Prime Video and Twitch. Connie and Steve Ballmer, who own the Clippers as well as Intuit Dome and the Forum, have pledged to match all donations made during the show.
The Times’ Mikael Wood and August Brown  were on site,  delivering live updates as they happened.
Lifestyle
The havoc caused by the blazes — more than 28,000 acres have been scorched — necessitates immediate and long-term relief.
5:45 p.m.Hello from the floor at the Forum for the early shift of FireAid, which may not quite be Music’s Biggest Night (that’s theGrammyson Sunday), but it certainly feels like it given the sheer star caliber of lineups here and at Intuit Dome a little later. Dave Matthews dropped off the bill for a family emergency, but still in store here are Alanis Morissette, Anderson .Paak, John Mayer, Dawes, Graham Nash, No Doubt, P!nk, Stephen Stills and the Black Crowes. Interested to see how Dawes performs given two memberslost homes or studios in Altadena.(August Brown)
6:11 p.m.And greetings from a very empty Intuit Dome, where the music is supposed to get underway at 7:30 — a message that appears to have reached the people of L.A. loud and clear. FireAid organizers have said the Forum bill leans rock while the lineup at Intuit is more pop. Wonder what Rod Stewart (who’s on the bill here) thinks about that.(Mikael Wood)
7:02 p.m.Green Day kicking this off with an elegant version of “Last Night on Earth” only to bring out another Billie from the second show down the road: Eilish, who came out to sing the second verse.(AB)
7:04 p.m.Intuit Dome is showing the Forum performances on the arena’s so-called Halo Board, and the two Billies drew a huge cheer from the crowd here.(MW)
7:17 p.m“Here at the Forum,” comedian Billy Crystal said, “the goal is to raise more money than the Dodgers spent on free agents.” They’re off to a good start–Crystal announced U2 just called in a million dollar donation. He also acknowledged losing his own home in the Palisades Fire. “These are the clothes I fled in,” he said, explaining that he looks like an evacuee or “somebody who robbed a 7/11.” He said that this gig had echoes of a similar fundraising host gig he took on after 9/11. “Now I’m one of the hurting thousands asking ‘have you seen my church, have you seen my town?”(AB)
7:18 p.m.Nice monologue from Crystal, who’s been doing this kind of thing — threading the needle between humor and pathos — for … what? Half a century? “One city, one heart,” he concludes.(MW)
7:24 p.m.Hopeful vibes from Alanis Morrissette, whose “Hand in My Pocket” and “Thank U” carried an air of gratitude and resilience as she wore an “I Heart LA” shirt: a “colorful, Wild place,” as she called it.(AB)
7:27 p.m.Alanis Morissette singing “Thank U” is a great opportunity to ponder one of the wildest opening lyrics in pop history: “How ‘bout getting off of these antibiotics?”(MW)
7:30 p.m.If you hold an all-star concert in L.A. and you don’t have Sheila E show up to whale on the timbales — as Ms. E just did with Anderson .Paak — did the concert really happen?(MW)
7:32 p.m.Glad they’re making ample time for individual horror stories about surviving the fires. “I wish it was just a terrible dream or a nightmare,” one Altadena resident said in a video. “Everything I’m wearing was provided by someone else. But I’m a carpenter, I want to rebuild Altadena. There are brighter days ahead.”(AB)
7:39 p.m.Crowd goes absolutely ham to Dr. Dre popping out for “Still D.R.E.” And “California Love” With Anderson .Paak. The Azoff Rolodex goes deep.(AB)
7:41 p.m.Crowd in here includes very soused Gen Xers who got a babysitter so they could happily justify dropping a grand on a big night out for fire relief.(AB)
7:42 p.m.Crowd at Intuit (which is nearing a full house) is older than I would’ve expected — but, as August suggests, FireAid tickets weren’t cheap.(MW)
California
As firefighters continue to battle multiple major wildfires, The Times has compiled a list of resources to help.
7:50 p.m.“I can’t think of anyone better to console us than Joni Mitchell,” Morrissette said, introducing the doyenne of the California canyons to perform the regal and resonant “Both Sides Now,” with a stripped back version of her Joni Jam band. “I really don’t know life at all,” she sang to close on a plaintive note. A reminder to Cherish your L.A. treasures while we’ve still got them.(AB)
7:52 p.m.I’ve had the privilege of seeing Mitchell perform several times in the past couple of years — that may have been the strongest she’s sounded yet.(MW)
7:56 p.m.Members of the Williams family from Altadena recalled onstage, “At 3:30 in morning, the warning hit our phones. We grabbed what we could — our grandmothers special clock, our father’s ashes, our 47-year-old parrot Hank. Among the five of us standing here, we lost four homes and we’re struggling to find places to live. We love our community — we’re all grieving immense loss.”
“At our mother’s home, everything was destroyed except her front door,” they said. “It stands. It’s a sign, because that door was always open.”(AB)
8:08 p.m.Poignant lyrics from the band Dawes, whose singer and drummer both lost homes and studios in Altadena. “You’ve got that special kind of sadness, a tragic set of charms / That only comes from time spent in Los Angeles / Makes me want to wrap you in my arms.” This city can feel like it’s got disaster in its bones right now and surviving is a mark of making a life here.
Then they brought out Stephen Stills and Mike Campbell of the Heartbreakers for Buffalo Springfield’s “For What It’s Worth.” A reminder of all the music history that went up in this blaze, too.(AB)
8:13 p.m.Graham Nash joins his old bandmate, Stephen Stills, to dispense a bit of local mythology — “Whenever Los Angeles gets into trouble, the musicians are right there,” he says — and a comforting rendition of “Teach Your Children.”(MW)
8:22 p.m.“If you’re hurting, I’m hurting with you,” said Pink in an all-black funereal outfit. “I’m gonna keep my feet on the ground tonight,” she promised, alluding to her usual aerial routines, but sang a knockout take of “Me and Bobby McGee,” a song she said brought her comfort in bad times.(AB)
8:28 p.m.Pink digs deep into her classic-rock bag for a scorching version of (Led Zeppelin’s version of) “Babe I’m Gonna Leave You.”(MW)
8:35 p.m.Samuel L. Jackson is starting the show here at Intuit Dome by shouting out the first responders in the house: “We love our firefighters and we need to help them,” Jackson says. Then he introduces Rod Stewart as a two-time Rock and Roll Hall of Famer — and his former neighbor. L.A.!(MW)
8:36 p.m.Can you imagine the Samuel L Jackson / Rod Stewart dinner parties we’ve been missing out on? Rod doing the Ezekiel 25:17 speech? Sam covering “Maggie May?”(AB)
8:39 p.m.“Here’s a new song,” Stewart says. “Not.” It’s “Maggie May,” of course, a song nobody in history has ever been sad to hear. Invite Rod to everything, is what I say.(MW)
8:48 p.m.Pink’s way of addressing the crowd to John Mayer: “Ladies and gentlemen and every other gender that absolutely exists.”(MW)
8:49 p.m.Despite the conflicts about climate and class inherent in the fires, the hosts have been avoiding politics until Pink tossed in that allusion to the current administration. Wonder if Billie Eilish or anyone with a passion for climate activism will make a more fervent point about it later.(AB)
8:57 p.m.Mayer, understanding the assignment as usual, describes Tom Petty’s “Free Fallin’” as “our first insight into the dream of living in California.”(MW)
9:04 p.m.I love that Earth, Wind and Fire tapped straight in with “That’s the Way of the World” — a song about “hearts of fire” — without a second thought. That’s how strong their vibes are and how welcome this tune is.(AB)
9:05 p.m.And now Earth, Wind and Fire is bringing the house down with the immortal “September,” a song with real-deal healing powers. Somebody give Verdine White a seat on the county Board of Supervisors.(MW)
9:16 p.m.John Fogerty is hitting us where we live right now with Creedence Clearwater Revival’s immortal “Have You Ever Seen the Rain?” If only this parched city had seen a lot more of it earlier in winter.(AB)
9:18 p.m.Second Zeppelin cover of the night: Chris and Rich Robinson of the Black Crowes doing “Going to California” with Slash, whom Chris accurately notes needed no introduction. (The top hat helps.)(MW)
9:21 p.m.Not the point of the evening, necessarily, but consider Gracie Abrams’ stardom secured. The crowd at Intuit just roared louder for the 25-year-old singer — a proud Palisades native, for what it’s worth — than they roared for anyone else all night. Accompanied by Aaron Dessner on acoustic guitar, she’s doing a stone-cold L.A. classic: Counting Crows’ “A Long December.”(MW)
9:33 p.m.Truly, who else are you going to call for this gig than No Doubt, the SoCal-est of SoCal bands, launches with “Just a Girl.” The band reunited for Coachella last year and might well have to keep it going if the Forum crowd has any say in it.(AB)
9:36 p.m.“Don’t Speak.” That’s it — that’s the tweet.(MW)
9:49 p.m.Stray thought during Tate McRae’s set: the long tail of OneRepublic’s “Apologize.”(MW)
9:56 p.m.I remember talking to McRae about moving to L.A. from Canada and what a culture shock it was for her. Wonder how the imagery of the fires will affect people around the world who had considered moving here for the usual reasons – and now see how quickly that fantasy can turn devastating.(AB)
9:54 p.m.“I am honored to play some country music” Jelly Roll says before muscling through “I Am Not OK,” a song about knowing that he can’t be the only one holding on for dear life. And then: a rollicking cover of the great Bob Seger’s “Hollywood Nights,” for which he’s joined by Travis Barker. What a song! More Seger (just in general), please.(MW)
10:02 p.m.I tell you, anytime I think of leaving this town, there is nothing like some “Hollywood Nights” to pull me right back in.(AB)
10:13 p.m.“Gonna go a little rogue here,” Stevie Nicks says as she recounts the night that the fires raced toward her Palisades home, a 1938 wood house that miraculously survived thanks to firefighters from Santa Rosa. “I cannot believe the bravery of these men,” she says. From the stage she gives them a special dedication of “Landslide,” which has got to be an all-timer of a thank you.(AB)
10:15 p.m.Stevie sometimes hits the autopilot in concert these days — hey, she’s been at it a while — but this “Landslide” is stunning: a full-body immersion into the certainty that life is gonna throw you for a loop now and then.(MW)
10:39 p.m.St. Vincent, Kim Gordon and Joan Jett each fronting a full-on Nirvana reunion — what a way to wind down the night! Good on Dave Grohl for turning out for this, given everything. Really hope Kim Gordon wins a Grammy this weekend. “The Collective” absolutely rules.(AB)
10:39 p.m.Grohl, Pat Smear and Krist Novoselic have almost-reunited Nirvana a few times over the last decade or so, often without warning and often for a good cause. Joan Jett just popped out to do “Territorial Pissings,” and now Grohl’s 18-year-old daughter, Violet, is here to sing “All Apologies” (with Novoselic on accordion). The band sounds great — bludgeoning but tuneful, heavy yet light on its feet.(MW)
10:51 p.m.Good on the producers for including a segment acknowledging all the animals lost or affected. To me that’s one of the undercovered parts of this tragedy.(AB)
10:53 p.m.For all its stars, FireAid is extremely short on hip-hop — and now, sitting inside Intuit Dome as Lil Baby plays to a dead room, I can see what organizers were trying to avoid. Definitely not a rap crowd.(MW)
11:05 p.m.And now, of course, we have arrived at the end, ready for the undisputed Los Angeles poet laureates of songs about California, the voices born ready at a moment of lament and longing for the Golden State, the only fair choice to wrap this thing up…who else could it possibly be but the Red Hot Chili Peppers with Flea in a Speedo?(AB)
11:26 p.m.Cute moment at the end where Green Day’s Tré Cool snuck up and handed off a replacement pair of drum sticks a fan from the Palisades lost in the fire.(AB)
11:29 p.m.We’re entering the homestretch at Intuit with Olivia Rodrigo, who says that she finds L.A. “so beautiful and so inspiring” and that she’s written many songs about the place, including the one she’s gonna play now: “Deja Vu,” in which she recounts a drive to Malibu for strawberry ice cream.(MW)
11:40 p.m.I stand corrected that the Red Hot Chili Peppers were gonna close this thing. Five hours in, we’ve still ostensibly got Lady Gaga and Peso Pluma and Sting and Billie Eilish and Stevie Wonder to come! The Grammys are amateurs compared to this monster runtime.(AB)
11:42 p.m.Wearing a turtleneck, tight trousers and a motivational speaker’s headset microphone — call him Sting Jobs? — Sting is power-trio-ing his way through the Police’s “Message in a Bottle.”(MW)
Music
The musician and former Police frontman talks about his life and career ahead of a five-night stand at the Wiltern in Los Angeles.
11:52 p.m.All respect to Peso Pluma for coming out to this, but this also would have been a great moment to showcase some local Latin music on a big stage in some capacity, especially given how deeply the fires affected local livelihoods and working class families.(AB)
11:57 p.m. Billie Eilish and her brother, Finneas, are going the acoustic-on-stools route for delicate versions of “Wildflower” and “The Greatest” — all the better to admire the siblings’ intricately intertwined vocal harmonies.(MW)
12:09 a.m.“L.A. is like my favorite place in the world and my only home,” Eilish says as she introduces an especially airy “Birds of a Feather.”(MW)
12:24 a.m.Lovely to still have Stevie Wonder as a fixed point in a turning world for fraught moments like this. “Love’s in Need of Love Today” is the top of the canon for healing and optimism, and this probably hits home for the intergenerational Black families in attendance that lost so much in Altadena.(AB)
12:30 a.m.“Let’s hit it,” Stevie tells his band — his cue to rev up “Superstition,” for which Sting joins him. Now Flea is up there too (in a Lakers-gold beret) for a thrumming “Higher Ground.” Who’d ever turn down an offer to jam with Stevie?(MW)
12:35 a.m.Finally, Jimmy Kimmel offered a specific thank you towards the incarcerated firefighters who play a fundamental role on the front lines of protecting urban and wildlands in SoCal. Let’s take the occasion to give them a raise and better path to a career in firefighting down the road.(AB)
12:37 a.m.FireAid’s closer is Lady Gaga, who’s starting her set behind a piano with a pair of tunes from “A Star Is Born”: a solo take on her and Bradley Cooper’s “Shallow” and a muscular rendition of “Always Remember Us This Way.” Her vocals are on point.(MW)
Music
The pop superstar talks about her smash duet with Bruno Mars that’s nominated for two prizes at February’s Grammy Awards.
12:42 a.m.Gaga says she “wanted to do something hopeful” for the show but couldn’t find the right song — so she wrote a new one with her fiancé, Michael Polansky. “It’s just for tonight — just for you,” she says, and it’s a bouncy musical-theater-ish number about the healing power of time.(MW)
12:46 a.m.Well, a new single-use, one-night-only Lady Gaga single seems like a fitting and hopeful way to sign off. The recovery effort in SoCal will take years, but this was a heartfelt and hopefully lucrative step on the way to whatever healing comes next. Thanks for coming along on the ride with us, see you all Sunday at the Grammys.(AB)

State officials approve Edison rate hike for 2017 wildfire sparked by its equipment,https://www.latimes.com/environment/story/2025-01-30/state-officials-approve-edison-rate-increase-for-thomas-fire,2025-01-31,"The California Public Utilities Commission voted Thursday to allow Southern California Edison to raise electric rates to cover payments it made to victims of the devastating 2017 Thomas wildfire.
Investigators found that the utility’s equipment sparked the blaze, one of the largest in California history. The fire’s devastation also helped spur the catastrophic debris flows in Montecito, which killed 23.
With no discussion, the commission approved the rate hike by a 4-0 vote. The vote means that more than $1.6 billion of the $2.7 billion that Edison paid to more than 5,000 victims of the fire will be covered by its customers. The rest will be paid by shareholders of the for-profit company.
After the vote, seven Democratic state legislators sent a letter to the commission, saying the action harmed customers and failed to hold Edison accountable.
“Those in regions prone to wildfires have already suffered the consequences of utility failure by being forced to endure power outages, property destruction, and displacement,” wrote the legislators, who include Sen. Ben Allen (D-Santa Monica). “It is reprehensible to require these same consumers to assume the financial responsibility for corporate mismanagement and infrastructure deficiencies.”
Edison said it planned to minimize the impact on customers by spreading the cost over 30 years. Most customers would see an increase to their monthly bill of about $1, the company said.
The commissioners approved the rate hike despite dozens of written comments from the public saying it wasn’t fair to make customers pay for costs of a wildfire that state and local government investigators had determined was started by the utility’s equipment.
“Relieving Edison of its duties to provide safe and reliable services by forcing its customers to foot the bill for their outright negligence is unconscionable,” wrote Emma Mailey, a resident of Los Angeles. She added that such an action “will teach them nothing and lead to more inaction on Edison’s part.”
Edison disputed investigators’ claims that its actions negligently caused the fire, saying in apress releaselast year that it had “prudently operated its system, managing it at or above what is required by regulators.”
“Climate change is driving catastrophic wildfires,” Pedro Pizarro, president of Edison International, said in the release, “and SCE will continue its work to mitigate the effects.”
The company has also asked the commission to approve a second rate increase for $5.4 billion in payments to victims of the devastating 2018 Woolsey fire, which the commission will consider at a later date. Investigators found Edison’s equipment also sparked that fire.
Combined, the two proposals would increase rates by more than 2%.
Climate & Environment
As Southern California Edison fights claims that it caused the deadly Eaton fire, the company is lobbying state regulators to have its customers cover more than $7 billion for damages it paid to the victims of two massive wildfires in 2017 and 2018.
California’s electric rates are the second-highest in the nation. Edison’s rates have increased 48% in the last three years, according toa December reportby the utility commission’s public advocates office.
After the vote, Alice Reynolds, the commission’s president, said that if she and the other members hadn’t approved the settlement agreement it could have led to litigation “with an unknown result.”
Reynolds and the other commission members were appointed by Gov. Gavin Newsom.
She said the commission was operating under a legal standard in a 2019 law that said if a wildfire was sparked by a utility’s equipment but the company was found to have acted “prudently,” the costs would be covered by customers.
The 2019 law, known as AB 1054, created a wildfire insurance fund. The Thomas and Woolsey fires don’t qualify for money from the fund because they happened before the law passed.
Climate & Environment
State regulators criticized Southern California Edison for falling behind in inspecting transmission lines in areas at high risk of wildfires just months before the deadly Eaton fire, according to state documents.
Edison’s equipment is now under scrutiny in the wake of the Eaton firestorm in Altadena, which killed at least 17 people and destroyed thousands of homes and businesses.
Lawyers representing victims point to cellphone videos taken by eyewitnesses that show the first flames below the company’s transmission tower in Eaton Canyon.
Edison said it is conducting its own investigation while cooperating with government fire investigators probing the cause of the inferno.
The 2017 Thomas fire swept through almost 282,000 acres in Ventura and Santa Barbara counties, destroying more than 1,000 structures and causing two deaths.
Investigators said Edison’s equipment was the cause of two separate ignitions on Dec. 4, 2017, near Santa Paula. The two fires eventually merged together.
Cal Fire and Ventura County fire investigators said one ignition was caused by an electric wire falling and igniting dry brush. The other ignition happened, the investigators said, when two wires slapped together, releasing molten metal into the vegetation.
The commission’s safety and enforcement division later said the company had violated five rules and regulations, including failure to cooperate with investigators.
In January 2018, while the fire was still burning, heavy rainfall led to debris flows in Montecito. Officials said the mud and boulders were dislodged in part because of the fire’s toll on vegetation and soil.
Edison has argued that its equipment wasn’t responsible for one of the two ignitions. And it says it disagrees with findings of the commission’s safety and enforcement division that it had violated any rules or regulations, including the claim that it had failed to cooperate with investigators.
Terrie Prosper, a commission spokesperson, said that although the agency’s enforcement staff identified the violations, the commission approved a 2021 agreement with Edison that found no violations related to the Thomas fire. As part of that agreement, Edison agreed to $550 million in financial penalties for multiple wildfires, including the Thomas fire.
Edison said it blames the damage and deaths caused by the Montecito debris flows on “inadequate governmental flood control infrastructure and deficient evacuation communications.”

Online tracker shows insurance payments to wildfire survivors,https://www.latimes.com/business/story/2025-01-30/online-tracker-shows-insurance-payments-to-wildfire-survivors,2025-01-30,"A new online toolthat tracks insurance payouts stemming from wildfires that devastated parts of Los Angeles County shows more than $4 billion has been paid so far, largely to replace lost personal items and cover living expenses.
California Insurance Commissioner Ricardo Laraannouncedthe new tracker Thursday.
Lara’s office said insurance companies have madethe quick disbursementssince the fires largely because of laws implemented after previous wildfires that help people find housing and replace personal items.
Business
For those who lost their homes to the wildfires around Los Angeles, filing for an insurance claim is one of many tasks to take care of in the aftermath.
Monetary amounts shown on the tracker are expected to grow in the coming weeks and months as more people begin the claims process.
CoreLogic, a property data and analytics firm, estimates the Palisades and Eaton fires will result in$35 billion to $45 billionin insurance payouts to homeowners and businesses.
“With so much misinformation and speculation about our insurance market after the Southern California wildfires, it is critical for the public to track claims and monitor payouts. All eyes are on the insurance companies, and so are mine,” Lara said in a news release.
The  numbers show that as of Jan. 27, 31,210 claims have been filed, with nearly half of those already partially paid under the laws requiring advance payments to speed recovery.
The bulk of unpaid claims are related to property damage and debris removal, Lara’s office said.
State law requires certain upfront payments by request. Insurance companies are required to provide fundsfor replacing personal propertyin an amount representing 30% of the policy’s dwelling limit, up to $250,000, without requiring the policyholder to file an itemized claim.They are also requiredto provide advance payment of no less than four months of living expenses.
Lara said he expects insurance companies “to continue providing advance payments that are essential for getting survivors back on their feet as quickly as possible.” After reports that some people were not getting upfront payments, Laraput out a bulletinreminding insurance companies of their obligations under the laws.
Michael Soller, a spokesperson for the insurance commissioner, said data were collected expressly for the purpose of promoting understanding among consumers that claims are being paid immediately and keeping insurance companies accountable.
“You’ve probably seen estimates out there. But this is the first real number of what’s been paid out to date to consumers,” Soller said.
The data displayed on the tracker were collected directly from insurance companies, including California’s FAIR Plan, the state’s insurer of last resort, and represent most residential and commercial property insurers. The insurance commissioner’s office expects to update the data every few weeks.

"A world away from the Palisades and Altadena, landlords try to sell fire victims on living downtown",https://www.latimes.com/business/story/2025-01-30/a-world-away-from-the-palisades-and-altadena-apartment-landlords-try-to-sell-fire-victims-on-living-downtown,2025-01-30,"With thousands of  houses and apartments lost to wildfires in an already tight housing market,  landlords in  downtown Los Angeles  are trying  to woo displaced fire victims to a more urban setting far from the burn zones.
A social media  campaign has been launched by members of theHistoric Core Business Improvement Districtto get people searching for housing to consider moving into one of L.A.’s oldest neighborhoods, where century-old office and retail buildings on blocks south of City Hallhave been converted to apartments.
Downtown is outside the familiar haunts of most displaced people, district Executive Director Blair Besten acknowledged, but she said she hopes the availability and price of apartments there might tempt them to consider it.
“The Westside and the Pasadena area might be saturated with people wanting to move in proximity to where they lived before,” Besten said. “That might not be possible.”
California
With thousands of people displaced from their homes, the real estate markets around Pacific Palisades and Altadena are raging, with rentals and homes attracting multiple offers.
Quite a few displaced people were already apartment renters. Real estate data provider CoStar said 480 multifamily buildings with 9,500 rental units were potentially damaged or destroyed within the fire zones.
The affected properties are overwhelmingly older, small-scale apartment buildings owned by mom-and-pop landlords. Nearly 75% of the buildings contain fewer than 15 units, CoStar said, and have an average age of 71 years. Many of them lack common modern amenities such as central air conditioning, fitness centers or pools.
The cost to rebuildsuch modest housing “poses a nearly insurmountable challenge,” CoStar said. “New apartment construction in Los Angeles has skewed toward luxury, with units completed last year averaging $3,300 in rent, a stark contrast to the rates associated with the rental properties in the fire zones” where the average asking rate was $2,640 per month.
Modern seismic building codes and inflation-driven construction costs further compound the difficulty of redevelopment, making it financially prohibitive for many property owners, CoStar said.
The Historic Core program has about 500 units available at an average of $2,046 per month, Besten said. To  increase the appeal to fire refugees, landlords are offering leases as short as three months and will arrange with furniture rental businesses to furnish units for new tenants.
“We’ve tried to very quickly furnish some homes, including kitchen essentials and bath essentials,” said Laurie Miskuski of landlord ICO Group. “There are many people who have lost everything, and the last thing they need to be worrying about is a toaster or a coffee maker.”
Among ICO Group’s properties is theMercantile Lofts, which opened as a department store in 1907 and was turned into housing more than a decade ago. ICO also owns   theBroadway Lofts, a 1907 Renaissance Revival-style building also dating to 1907.
The fires that turned people out of their homes have been “an incredibly traumatic event,” Miskuski said. “We’re trying to extend a hand and say, ‘Hey, we may not be the neighborhood you’re used to, but we are a vibrant neighborhood with many things to offer where more people are welcome.’”
The bulk of the units included in the business improvement district’s outreach program  so far are in five historic buildings that have had  problems of their own as a new owner took on deferred maintenance and ejected tenants who weren’t paying rent.
“COVID did a lot of damage to downtown in a lot of ways,” said Mark Sanders, co-founder of landlord Fifteen Group. “Habitually, people were not paying rent, and the eviction moratorium didn’t help.
“It’s taken us a long time to cycle through a lot of those units, which is why we have this vacancy” well above market standards, Sanders said.
He hopes that the ample vacancy in his buildings that include theMarley Loftsand theThurman Loftsmight even be a selling point to people displaced by the fire who might want to live close to family members, friends or members of their church or synagogue.
“Now they have a chance to kind of stay together by renting in the same building,” he said.
The business improvement district  is looking to add other landlords to the appeal program, which Besten hopes will also improve the public image of the Historic Core.
The district’sadvertising campaign on Instagramfocuses on the availability of short-term leases and the chance to live in architecturally historic buildings in a neighborhood that has shops, restaurants, offices and entertainment in walking distance.
Once the commercial heart of the city for business, shopping and entertainment, the district fell on hard times in the late 20th century as businesses moved a few blocks west and department stores followed their customers to the suburbs. It revived after 2000 with the arrival of apartments, trendy stores, bars and upscale restaurants, but the tenor of some streets changed again during the pandemic as homelessness became more prevalent.
Reaching out to people displaced by fire offers district stakeholders an opportunity to reach out to “people who have been curious about what it’s like to live somewhere and not have to get in their car for an entire weekend” she said. They may ask, “what does that look like and would I be willing to give it a shot?”

"Prosecutors claim defendant strangled, beheaded and buried homeless woman in Huntington Beach",https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2025-01-30/prosecutors-claim-defendant-strangled-beheaded-and-buried-homeless-woman-in-huntington-beach,2025-01-30,"A man accused of killing a homeless woman in Huntington Beach more than two years ago strangled her to death before decapitating her and burying her body, Orange County prosecutors argued in court Wednesday.
But the defense attorney for Antonio Padilla said the woman had been in poor health and her cause of death was never confirmed. Public Defender Daniel Kim also attempted to cast suspicion on other possible suspects during opening statements in Padilla’s trial.
Padilla faces one count of murder in connection with the death of Gina Marie Lockhart. Her body was unearthed by detectives in the yard of his parents’ mobile home on the 7800 block of Slater Avenue on July 17, 2022.
“The lingering question is ... how did Ms. Lockhart die?” Kim said.
Padilla was homeless at the time of the woman’s death and occasionally stayed in a shed at the back of the property, Janine Madera, senior prosecutor for the Orange County District Attorney’s office, told the jury. His relatives began smelling a foul odor at the home about 15 days before Lockhart’s body was found. Loud noises could be heard from the shed in the days that followed, and the defendant’s sister reported seeing her brother burying something in the yard.
At one point, Padilla’s mother saw him carrying items wrapped in blankets that appeared to be stained with blood and crawling with maggots, Madera said. He refused to show her what was inside and fled when she decided to call the police.
Although officers responding on July 11 took note of a strong odor at the home, they didn’t immediately suspect a crime, Madera said. They thought a dead animal may have been on the premises, and suggested that residents deep clean the area.
When the defendant’s mother tried to tidy up the shed, she found a patch of hair still attached to a piece of scalp, women’s clothing she didn’t recognize and a dirty pair of Vans shoes that were missing laces. She called police again on July 16 and showed them what she found.
Investigators began excavating the lot and found Lockhart’s head and body buried together in a makeshift grave. She had been hogtied with a pair of shoelaces.
A cadaver dog searched the area and indicated to officers that the victim may have been killed in the shed. Blood matching Lockhart’s DNA was found on its floor and on the blade of a large knife stashed in a toolbox inside.
There were no signs of a struggle, sexual assault or injury found on the victim’s body aside from her decapitation, which led forensic investigators to conclude the latter took place after she had already died. Madera suggested she had been strangled, and any physical signs of that would be difficult to identify conclusively after her head was removed.
“It was a clean cut, no hesitation marks,” Madera said.
Padilla’s defense attorney emphasized the absence of broken bones or other injuries inflicted on the victim prior to her death. Kim said Lockhart was an apparent alcoholic in poor health that was exacerbated by life on the street.
Lockhart was 60 at the time she died and had been hospitalized in August 2021 with seizures that would last as long as two minutes, Kim said. She had been admitted to a hospital for alcohol poisoning on June 24, 2022, less than a week before she was last seen alive.
An employee at a taco truck typically parked at Morgan Lane and Slater Avenue, Emilia Martinez, may have been the last person to interact with the victim. The witness testified that she spotted Lockhart in a nearby yard two years ago on June 30, apparently clutching her belly in pain and lying in the fetal position.
Martinez also recalled frequently seeing Lockhart with a homeless man the victim had identified as her boyfriend, Rick Burnhardt. Kim attempted to paint Burnhardt as one of the last people who had contact with Lockhart and a potential suspect in her death.
However, the prosecutor pointed out that Burnhardt was working and staying at a job site in Long Beach at the time the victim went missing. She also noted cadaver dogs that searched his van did not appear to find anything suspicious.
The defense attorney told jurors that Antonio Padilla’s father, Mario Padilla, was seen rummaging in and around the shed as police investigated their property. He claimed the shed was actually the latter’s “man cave” and that his son would crash inside the mobile home instead of the shed. Kim also said his client’s father planted tomatoes over the site where Lockhart was buried, insinuating he attempted to conceal the grave.
Although the defendant and victim were both homeless and known to frequent the same area, there didn’t appear to be any prior connection between them, Madera said. Lockhart had been living on the street for about two years, her mother, Donna Ashbaugh, said from the witness stand Wednesday. They managed to keep in touch with each other and spoke on the phone at least once a week.
Ashbaugh described her daughter’s demeanor the last time they spoke as “kind of upbeat. She would always call me early to assure me she was OK.”

What we know about Edison and the Eaton fire,https://www.latimes.com/california/newsletter/2025-01-30/what-we-know-about-edison-and-the-eaton-fire-essential-california,2025-01-30,"Good morning. Here’s what you need to know to start your day.

Southern California Edison is under familiar scrutiny as investigators work to determine whether the utility’s equipment sparked the deadly Eaton fire earlier this month.
Edison provides power for millions of residents in Los Angeles, Ventura, Orange and adozen other countiesin the Golden State. The company has been found at fault for a few major wildfires in Southern California in recent years, including the2017 Thomas fireand2018’s Woolsey fire.
Now, facing multiple lawsuits from homeowners and atemporary restraining order, Edison has revealed more information about its equipment as investigators focus on an electrical transmission tower that may hold answers.
Residents reported seeing flames at the base of the tower perched above Eaton Canyon, visible in photos andvideosshared online.
Two days after the fire started, the utility companyreportedthat an early analysis showed “no interruptions or electrical or operational anomalies until more than one hour after the reported start time of the fire.”
But this week, SCE told state regulators that power lines over Eaton Canyonsaw a surge in currentjust before the fire was first reported. The utility stated that a fault in a line about five miles away sent the increased current across its lines over Eaton Canyon.
“That equipment is now part of an expanded court order for Edison to preserve data and hardware that could shed some light as to what exactly caused the deadly blaze,” Times reporter Salvador Hernandez wrote this week.
Critics say the delay in reporting the surge to investigators only raises more questions.
“They had a duty to tell the regulator,” Loretta Lynch, former president of the California Public Utilities Commission, told Salvador. “They either didn’t know, which should strike fear in the heart of every Californian that the utility didn’t know that their system failed, or they did know, and the question is why didn’t they say.”
Edison wants ratepayers to cover the cost of damages for its role in previous wildfires.
The state Public Utilities Commission is meeting today (Thursday) and will consider Edison’srequest to bill its customers to cover the cost of the $1.6 billion in damagesit paid to victims of the deadly 2017 Thomas fire in Ventura and Santa Barbara counties.
The commission will hear a similar request from Edison at a later meeting to allow it to charge ratepayers for the $5.4 billion in damages it paid out after being found liable for the 2018 Woolsey fire in Ventura and Los Angeles counties.
“If both measures are approved, Edison customers will have a roughly 2% surcharge on their bills for the next 30 years, according to regulatory documents,” The Times’ Melody Petersen explained. “That means the average monthly bill for a residential customer, now $177, would rise to $181.”
Edison’s equipment ignited both wildfires, investigations found. Edison also violated multiple state safety regulations and impeded investigations, according to utility regulators.
More recently, federal officials haveaccused Edison of withholding evidencethat implicated its equipment as the cause of 2017’s Creek fire.
The company has denied the accusation and that it was responsible for that 2017 blaze.
What about the Palisades fire?
The U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives is leading the investigation into what caused the deadly fire in Pacific Palisades and Malibu, but it appears to be more of a mystery at this point.
The probe has centered on a popular hiking trail where the blaze is believed to have started on the morning of Jan. 7.
“Investigators have scoured each part of the trail and hillside, breaking it down into a grid,” my colleagues Richard Winton and Hannah Fry reported this week. “They have examined 250 leads, obtained 90 hours of relevant video and conducted 50 interviews.”
Sources with knowledge of the probe told Richard and Hannah that the fire appears to have human origins, and they have two leading theories.
Theory one: The fire was a reignition of a small brush fire that started on New Year’s Eve and was knocked down in the same general area. Fire officials believe that earlier blaze was sparked by holiday fireworks.
Theory two: The fire was entirely separate and started on Jan. 7 in a so-far unknown way.
“The ATF is seeking to issue a report on the cause of the fire in about 60 days,” they wrote. “That would be considerably faster than for the deadly August 2023 fire on the Hawaiian island of Maui, which took a year. But that may depend on whether more sophisticated tests are needed back at the bureau’s Maryland fire lab.”

Column: The Los Angeles fires are no excuse to slow down on clean energy,https://www.latimes.com/environment/newsletter/2025-01-30/column-the-los-angeles-fires-are-no-excuse-to-slow-down-on-clean-energy-boiling-point,2025-01-30,"If we want to build a safer future for Los Angeles, we can’t keep repeating the mistakes of the past.
So I was disappointed to learn that shortly after the Palisades fire broke out, L.A. Mayor Karen Bass suspended a crucial clean energy requirement for new homes, in a misguided effort to help Angelenos build back — a mistake that could soon be repeated by state officials, paving the way for a continued cycle of more destructive blazes.
As part of awide-ranging orderto help people rebuild their burned homes, Bass suspended a city requirement that new construction be all-electric. Unless she changes course, many builders will default to gas furnaces and water heaters — instead of more efficient electric heat pumps that don’t use planet-warming fossil fuels.
The more fossil fuels people burn, the more likely it is that L.A. willkeep suffering catastrophic fires.

Bass described her order as “the first step in clearing away red tape and bureaucracy” to expedite rebuilding. But there’s no reason to believe suspending the all-electric rule will make things faster — or substantially cheaper.
In fact, there’s strong evidence that all-electric homes can save families money.
If you’re shopping for a new heating system, an electric heat pump will run you a few thousand dollars more than a gas furnace (before accounting for government incentives, which can cover some or all of the difference). That’s according to theBuilding Decarbonization Coalition, a pro-electrification advocacy group.
When you’re building a new house, though, the California Energy Commission hasfoundthat going all-electric is often just as cheap as building the infrastructure for both gas and electric appliances. That’s because when you’re starting from scratch, you can save a lot of money by avoiding the cost of installing gas pipelines.
When the Energy Commission voted last year to update the statewide building code, it strongly incentivized heat pumps for space and water heating in new homes,starting in 2026. The agency estimated that the average newly built home would cost slightly more up front ($757). But it found that cost would be offset by $6,692 in long-term savings from lower utility bills, because heat pumps are more energy-efficient than gas appliances.
This stuff is a no-brainer, right? Especially with state and federal incentives, no one should build with gas.
Unfortunately, there’s a chance Gov. Gavin Newsom, an avowed clean energy champion, will follow Bass’ lead and throw out California’s cost-effective electric building rules — in the name of helping Angelenos rebuild.
In a Jan. 12executive order, Newsom directed state officials to report back to him within 60 days on whether any provisions of the building code should be suspended for people building back from the Palisades, Eaton or other L.A. County wildfires, “in order to facilitate rapid, safe, and cost-effective rebuilding and recovery.”
Even worse, Assembly Speaker Robert Rivasproposed legislationthat would mandate “no new additions to state or local building standards, unless required to address health and safety risks or to add fire resistant technology.”AB 306would block most building code updates until 2031 — meaning six excruciating years with no new energy efficiency rules or electrification standards. The prohibition would apply statewide, not just in burn zones.
That is a terrible idea, full stop. Lawmakers shouldn’t use the fires as an excuse to slow down on clean energy — not when scientists say humanity mustslash emissions much fasterto keep the climate crisis from getting worse, and not when the climate crisis is a significant reason we’re seeing these catastrophic fires in the first place.
I asked a spokesperson for Rivas, Nick Miller, what the Assembly speaker is thinking.
AB 306 “will provide certainty and reduce delays for Angelenos who urgently need to rebuild their homes, while preserving and protecting climate-smart building laws,” Miller said in an email. “Our goal is to put L.A. on a quick path to recovery and accelerate new housing in Southern California and across the state.”
It’s unclear whether Newsom will try to pause existing clean energy codes. A spokesperson declined to offer any insights, saying in an email that Newsom is “laser-focused on removing unnecessary bureaucratic hurdles so that the communities impacted by the wildfires in the Los Angeles area can rebuild faster, safer, and stronger.”
In theory, that makes sense. Everyone wants to make life as easy as possible for wildfire victims.
But here’s the reality: Fossil-fueled appliances in homes and businesses spewmore than 10%of California’s heat-trapping emissions. If California wants to lead the world on fighting climate change — more important now than ever withPresident Trump in the White House— state and local leaders need to do more, not less.
Climate advocates are alarmed by the apparent rush to rethink clean energy rules.
Ben Stapleton serves as executive director of the nonprofitU.S. Green Building Council California, which worked with families whose homes burned in theThomasandWoolseyfires to help them rebuild more sustainable, fire-resilient houses. This month, the group is talking with Los Angeles officials about a program to educate families, architects and contractors about building back with electric appliances, rooftop solar and fire-resistant materials.
Stapleton said he was disappointed by Bass’ executive order, because there’s no reason building a house without gas should be slower. If anything, avoiding the need to lay gas pipes can make the process faster and cheaper.
When I asked Stapleton about Newsom’s executive order and Rivas’ bill, he was clearly frustrated.
“The message to people is that all-electric must cost more and take longer,” he said.
A few hours before we talked, Stapleton drove through Altadena, which wasdevastated by the Eaton fire. He lives nearby, in Pasadena. The flames stopped half a mile from his home. His family evacuated for nearly a week.
“I do think this is going to be a collective scar on the psyche of L.A.,” he said.
Healing that scar should involve embracing clean energy, not doubling down on the dirty fuels that scientists tell us areexacerbating California’s wildfire crisis— and causing more intense heat waves, storms and floods.
Lisa Hart, executive director of theNeighborhood Council Sustainability Alliance, feels the same.
Hart lives in Silver Lake and started fielding calls from her parents as the Eaton fire grew, warning her to be ready to evacuate. Fortunately, she was able to stay put. She offered up her place to friends looking for shelter.
Hart said she understands that politicians “want to make things cheaper and faster and easier” for people whose houses burned down. She hopes they’ll learn that building without gas actually supports those goals.
There are also health benefits to getting fossil fuels out of household kitchens. Although gas stoves cost less than electric induction cooktops, they can release nitrogen dioxide, benzene and otherpotentially deadly pollutants.
“Going all-electric is safer and faster, and right for the climate,” Hart said.
One complicating factor: Although state officials estimate that electric space and water heating adds just $757 to the upfront cost of a new home, the California Building Industry Assn. gave me a higher figure of $2,500.
That’s not a lot relative to the state’s astronomical home prices — and homeowners would probably still save plenty of money in the long run from lower utility bills. But Chris Ochoa, a senior counsel at the building industry group, pointed to anestimatethat for every $1,000 increase in the price of a home, 7,905 households are priced out.
That said, Ochoa expects many households will continue to ditch gas by choice.
“We’ve got a bunch of our builders already building all-electric,” he said. “We can continue to do it.”
Most folks rebuilding in Pacific Palisades, one of L.A.’s wealthiest enclaves, should be able to afford any potential cost increase for heat pumps and induction stoves (even before accounting for incentives). For politicians looking to help lower-income Altadena residents build back without gas, additional financial support could go a long way.
This isn’t just a conversation about money, though. It’s also a conversation about values.
When I asked state Sen. Ben Allen (D-Santa Monica), who represents Pacific Palisades, about Bass’ order waiving the all-electric rule, he told me he suspected it had a lot to do with giving people “options and flexibility.”
“These people are just trying to get back on their feet after suffering an extraordinary disaster,” Allen said. “I am loath to want to be too micromanage-y of the homeowners who want to rebuild their homes.”
Most people don’t care how their homes are heated. But cooking is another story.
Bass may not want to tell Angelenos whose houses burned that they need to switch from gas stoves to induction cooktops — not a lifestyle downgrade, at leastaccording to many chefs, but still a significant change.
If that’s what the mayor is thinking, she hasn’t said. In a written statement, spokesperson Zach Seidl told me that Bass “absolutely wants to rebuild the Palisades to be more resilient — and it will be.”
Allen, the state senator, wants to see demolished communities in his district build back with clean energy as a top priority — but ideally through rebates, tax incentives and other encouragement, not strict mandates.
As a possible model, he pointed to a billsigned by Newsomlast year that makes it easier for utilities to transition whole neighborhoods from gas heating and cooking to electric appliances — specifically in areas where doing so can save utility ratepayers money by negating the need for expensive gas pipeline replacements.
“I don’t want to be too heavy-handed, given the delicacy of the situation,” Allen said.
That’s an admirable instinct — especially given Allen’s acknowledgment that California also needs to work harder on climate, not rest on its laurels. Representatives for several other politicians I contacted for this column pointed to the state’s existing accomplishments as if they were some kind of proof that it’s OK to take a breather.
Now is not the time to press pause. Unless emissions drop a lot faster, tragedy will keep coming.
The burden of confronting global warming can’t and shouldn’t fall on fire victims alone. But building new homes without gas hookups should be a relatively easy lift. Especially for California. Especially for Los Angeles.
Bass, Newsom, Rivas: Tread delicately during a tragic time. But please don’t take us backward.

What — or who — started the Palisades fire? Two leading theories emerge as investigation intensifies,https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2025-01-30/inside-the-intense-search-for-what-or-who-started-the-palisades-fire,2025-01-30,"For the last few weeks, a team of investigators from the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives has worked out of a command post in the Highlands neighborhood of Pacific Palisades.
It’s here, near a popular hiking trail, where officials believe the Palisades fire began around 10:30 a.m. Jan. 7.The remnants of thousands ofburned-out homes line the path the flames took down from the hillside as it charged all the way to the ocean.
But the cause remains a mystery that this team is trying to solve.
Investigators have scoured each part of the trail and hillside, breaking it down into a grid. They have examined 250 leads, obtained 90 hours of relevant video and conducted 50 interviews.
California
The origin point of the Palisades fire could be around a beloved hiking trail with ocean views — and where another fire was sparked days earlier. Here is what we know.
Fifteen ATF team members across the country with various science backgrounds armed with high-tech mapping, drones and a portable lab are aiding in the investigation, officials said.
ATF officials declined to provide information about what they suspect started the Palisades fire, which charred 23,400 acres and leveled more than 6,800 structures, including many homes.
But sources with knowledge of the inquiry said there are two leading theories: An 8-acre blaze that fire officials thought they had put out on Jan. 1 in the same area reignited and spread because of intense winds, or a new fire was somehow sparked nearby that morning. Either scenario, the sources said, would likely be a human-caused fire because there are no power poles near the point of origin and trail area is well-traveled.
The Los Angeles Fire Department declined to answer specific questions about the Jan. 1 blaze, called the Lachman fire, saying the files were “sealed” and were part of the ongoing investigation into the Palisades fire.
“We won’t leave a fire that has any hot spots. But with that, I will tell you that the investigation, the team that we have on board right now, will be able to determine whether or not that did indeed happen,” Los Angeles Fire Chief Kristin Crowley told residents during a community forum this month.”I can look you in the eye and tell you that full disclosure if that indeed is what they find out, we will tell you that.”
The Lachman fire was reported about 12:17 a.m. on New Year’s Day in the hillside above Pacific Palisades by a resident whose home is about two blocks from the popular Skull Rock trail. Sources with knowledge of the investigation who were not authorized to speak publicly told The Times the Lachman fire appears to have been sparked by fireworks.
California
We’re tracking damage assessments from the Eaton and Palisades fires, which destroyed 12,000 structures in Altadena and Pacific Palisades.
Water-dropping helicopters initially were not able to fly  because of wind, according to the agency, but around 1:40 a.m. they began launching an aerial attack to support crews on the ground. News footage captured the charge, with walls of flames towering over homes and firefighters with hoses running into backyards.
Shortly after 3:30 a.m., fire officials reported they had stopped forward progress of the blaze.
A little over an hour later,LAFD reportedthat firefighters had “completed the hose line around the perimeter of the fire and it is fully contained.” However, some firefighters remained at the site to mop up and ensure the fire didn’t flare up again.
Assistant Chief Joe Everett, who oversees LAFD’s West Bureau, which includes Pacific Palisades, said firefighters conducted a cold trailing operation at the site in which crews feel for any lingering heat along the fire’s edge, dig out every live spot and trench live edges of the fire to ensure nothing can later flare up.
They kept patrol on the site for more than 36 hours, Everett told residents at a community meeting this month.
“I can tell you those people on that fire ground were highly qualified and well trusted,” he said.

‘Mom, are we going to have to run?’ Here’s how the first 24 hours of our unprecedented conflagration unfolded across L.A. County
Everett expressed skepticism  that the Palisades fire was sparked by a rekindling of the earlier blaze.
“That fire was dead out. If it is determined that was the cause, it would be a phenomenon,” he said.
LAFD officials declined to detail whether they conducted thermal imaging of the area in the aftermath. Agencies frequently use thermal imaging during large wildfires to find hot spots during periods when there is no visible light or in conditions with heavy smog or mist.
UC San Diego cameras that monitor the mountains and hills, including Pacific Palisades, captured the Jan. 1 blaze. The Times reviewed available footage over the next six days, and no new smoke was visible. But about 10:30 a.m. Jan. 7, new smoke is seen in the same area.
By midmorning, firefighters were back at the same Palisades hillside amid hurricane-force winds fighting what would become a much larger inferno: the Palisades fire.
Palisades resident Darrin Hurwitz told The Times this month that he was hiking in the area — a five-mile loop that took him above Skull Rock and gave him a view of the burn scar from the New Year’s Day fire — on the morning of Jan. 7. It’s a busy trail, but on that day the open space seemed quiet, he said.
“Around the same time, I noticed a bit of a smoky smell. I didn’t make much of it. I figured it was either coming from somewhere else or was the remnants of the fire itself,” he said.
Others also smelled smoke in the area that morning, but flames weren’t seen until about 10:15 a.m.
A Los Angeles firefighter who was among the first on the scene acknowledged over the radio that they were going “back up to where the Lachman fire was.”
The ATF is seeking to issue a report on the cause of the fire in about 60 days. That would be considerably faster than for thedeadly August 2023 fire on the Hawaiian island of Maui,which took a year. But that may depend on whether more sophisticated tests are needed back at the bureau’s Maryland fire lab.
Complex fire investigations in which a cause isn’t immediately clear can sometimes take many months to conclude. Typically, investigators will start by finding the area of ignition, which they determine largely through burn patterns. In a massive inferno, such as the Palisades fire, that process alone can take more than a week, experts say.
After they find the location of the fire start, investigators will search for any evidence that could point to the source of ignition and any witness statements or videos that can help them piece together how the fire began.
Materials found at a fire scene will often need to be tested, and those results can take weeks or months, said Gianni Muschetto, staff chief of law enforcement for the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection.
“These larger fires take time,” Muschetto said. “Sometimes it’s months, and sometimes just based on the evidence we have that needs to be evaluated, it just takes time to do.”
The first images of Palisades fire, as it ignited in the brush on a trail above Pacific Palisades, are eerily similar to those captured as fire lighted up the night’s sky as the new year began.
California
Edison says current increase “remained within the design limits and operating criteria” for the circuits and “did not trigger system protection on these lines.”
Fire experts say it’s possible for a blaze to rekindle days and even months in some environments after an initial fire is thought to be extinguished.
The immense Oakland Hills fire in 1991, which destroyed 2,500 structures, exploded after firefighters believed they contained an earlier 6-acre fire the day before. Firefighters left equipment at the scene but did not continuously monitor it. Winds picked up, and the conflagration consumed homes.
The Maui fire, the deadliest in more than a century, killed at least 101 people and also ignited from an earlier brush fire caused by downed power lines that firefighters believed they had snuffed.
Rekindling days or weeks after a wildfire has been put out is not a phenomenon that frequently occurs. It’s more typical for rekindling to happen when firefighters are still on scene mopping up, allowing them to get control of it quickly, Muschetto said.
“You’re trying to get all those hot spots out, but occasionally something will still hold that heat and blow something across the line or burn under through the roots and have enough exposure to vegetative material to burn out and cause a fire,” he said.
Ed Nordskog, a former Los Angeles County sheriff’s arson investigator who looked into 2,500 fires, said that in forestry environments particularly, embers can bury themselves in tree roots and get covered by heavy ash. They can stay buried until a wind event sets them free.
The U.S. Forest Service uses infrared technology to monitor fires underbrush for sometimes weeks after a blaze is contained. Nordskog said thermal imaging is the safest way to check to prevent such an issue.
But even that isn’t a perfect solution.
“A super small smoldering fire may not put off enough heat signature for that imagery to pick it up,” Muschetto said. “That’s why the crews on the ground, especially when they are mopping up along the fire’s edge, they’re really looking for anything that’s smoking, anything that might be able to hold heat and watering that down.”

"CSU, reeling from budget cuts to classes and faculty, decries more proposed state reductions",https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2025-01-30/csu-leaders-decry-deep-proposed-budget-cuts,2025-01-30,"Leaders of California State University voiced alarm Wednesday that proposed state funding cuts would be “catastrophic” and cripple the nation’s largest four-year public higher education system’s ability to serve as a powerful engine of progress for low-income and underserved students.
Under Gov. GavinNewsom’s proposed 2025-26 budget, CSU faces a $375-million funding cut — a 7.95% reduction, the equivalent of 20% of its entire full-time faculty — university officials told the Board of Trustees. The shortfall would leave no new funds for student support, mental health, basic needs, employee pay, infrastructure and other needs, they said.
“Cuts have consequences, and with a proposed cut of this magnitude those consequences will be stark, painful, heartbreaking,” CSU Chancellor Mildred García told the board.
The CSU’s 23 campuses enroll more than 450,000 students — and graduate 125,000 each year, with alumni accounting for 10% of the California workforce. Nine of 10 CSU students are Californians who generally mirror the state’s demographic makeup, with nearly half Latino, 20% white, 15.7% Asian and 4% Black students. About 46% are low-income and nearly 30% are the first in their families to attend college, leading to several rankings as national leaders in helping students move up the social and economic ladder.
But the proposed cuts could jeopardize that mission, García and others said during a finance committee meeting in Long Beach.
“You can’t have us be the economic engine of the state and destroy the system at the same time with these budget cuts,” Trustee Jack McGrory said.
California
The California State University system plans to shift the endgame for student success, boosting efforts to help students get not only a four-year degree but also a good job in a reset of years of focus on graduation rates as the ultimate goalpost.
H.D. Palmer, state Department of Finance spokesman, said in an email to The Times that the 7.95% proposed reduction is being applied to all state agencies, not only the public university systems.
“Neither CSU nor UC are being singled out, and are being treated consistently with the rest of the state and with a half-year of advance notice (the current budget was signed last June 29th),” he said in the email. “Further, there’s significant discretion in how these reductions are applied across the system, and can take into account the financial condition and/or student enrollment of a campus when determining how to schedule this reduction.”
The proposed cuts would exacerbate reductions that some campuses have already made in the last few years. Systemwide, 73 degree programs were suspended and 63 degree programs were discontinued by the trustees last year; course sections were reduced. Among 23 campuses, 17 cut positions while six increased them, for a net loss of 823 jobs between 2023 and 2024. Eight campuses with ongoing, declining enrollment trends — including San Francisco, Sonoma and Humboldt — accounted for nearly half the cuts.
Even campuses with growing enrollment are facing budget deficits. Cal State Long Beach is projecting a $15-million budget deficit because additional tuition revenue from more students won’t fully cover the state’s proposed cut and higher mandatory costs for health care, insurance and utilities. The campus is not anticipating layoffs but implemented a hiring freeze last fall and has asked division leaders for specific plans on how to mitigate the deficit, President Jane Close Conoley told faculty and staffin a memo this month.
Cal State L.A. is struggling with a $32.4-million deficit this year brought on by state cuts, unfunded employee pay increases and inflation — and the proposed cut for 2025-26 could widen that gap by another $19.7 million, President Berenecea Johnson Eanes told the campus community in a memo last fall.
“Combined, these are more than 20% of our budget. A 20% budget cut is not survivable without significant changes and a lot of tough decisions,” she wrote.
So far, Cal State L.A. has not eliminated any degree programs, but course offerings have been reduced. In the political science department, for instance, upper-division electives have been reduced from 22 in spring 2022 to 13 in spring 2025; sections for the required Introduction to American Government class are down from 14 to nine during that same period.
The use of lecturers has declined by as much as 70%. Three lecturers lost all classes and four others were reduced to part-time work this year. The result, faculty say, is that students are having a harder time getting needed classes, taking a lower course load and delaying their graduation.
Cuts are more dire at other campuses.
Sonoma State University announced last week it wouldeliminate its entire athletic program— disbanding 11 teams with as many as 235 student athletes. The campus will also axe 23 degree programs, including physics, economics, philosophy, geology, theater, dance, modern languages and women and gender studies. Among 302 students enrolled in those programs, 132 with more than 60 units will need to finish their programs with online classes elsewhere or transfer to other institutions, President Emily F. Cutrer told trustees Wednesday.
The university’s actions drew a flood of protest from students, faculty, coaches and alumni who spoke out in public comments at the meeting Tuesday. Many criticized Cutrer for announcing the cuts in an email, without adequate consultation with the community.
Cutrer said her leadership team is trying to support those who are “grieving” but see the changes as a necessary “reset” for Sonoma State, whose enrollment has plunged from a peak of 9,100 students in 2015 to 5,800 today. The decrease, she said, was triggered by such factors as the pandemic, the 2017 wildfires in Sonoma and Napa and the declining numbers of the traditional college-age population known in higher education as the “demographic cliff.”
“We strongly believe that the changes we are making are needed,” Cutrer said, adding that they would bring greater fiscal stability and meet the changing demand of students for particular careers.
California
But they will need to meet comprehensive targets to improve access, affordability and equity under Gov. Gavin Newsom’s revised budget proposal set to be unveiled Friday.
Some trustees also criticized the state for deferring $252 million in funding for enrollment increases and other goals set out in afive-year compactamong Newsom, CSU and the University of California. The compact guaranteed an annual 5% increase in base funding in exchange for progress in increasing graduation rates, eliminating achievement gaps and enrolling more California residents. The state is expecting the university systems to continue progress on those goals even though it is deferring the funding for it.
Palmer reiterated that the state is not eliminating the funding but is proposing to defer it. But some CSU officials expressed concern that continued projected state budget deficits, along with enormous costs to address the Palisades and Eaton fires, could potentially jeopardize the funding. Palmer also confirmed that “consistent with the compact agreements, we expect that the state’s university systems will continue to prioritize enrollment growth and equitable outcomes for students.”
He said he could not make any “definitive statement” on what budget changes, if any, may be made in the governor’s revised budget proposal to be released in May.
For now, CSU leaders said they plan a full-scale advocacy campaign to ramp up public pressure against the cuts.
“It’s a political campaign, and we’ve got to be aggressive acting like it is, said Trustee Douglas Faigin, who has served on the board for 12 years. “This is the biggest crisis that I’ve experienced since I’ve been on the board.”

Cannabis community rallies to help fire victims one bong and one fundraiser at a time,https://www.latimes.com/lifestyle/story/2025-01-30/la-cannabis-fire-relief-weed-charity-efforts,2025-01-30,"Medical marijuana patients and other 21-and-older weed consumers who left behind their pipes, bongs, rolling trays and other pot paraphernalia in the recent wildfires in L.A. County can get new gear — free of charge — at six West Hollywood dispensaries through an accessories drive organized by the local cannabis community.
“Not everyone thinks about putting that stuff in their go bag,” said Scott Schmidt, executive director of canna-business marketing organizationEmerald Village West Hollywood, which spearheaded the effort with help from theCannabis Chamber of CommerceandLos Angeles NORML.
Asked how the drive came about, Schmidt said: “We were really inspired by the generosity of folks that came out, donating clothes, donating water, diapers, first aid supplies and all of the necessities, but we weren’t seeing that the cannabis community was being included in that ... Especially because of federal prohibitions, a lot of nonprofits probably don’t want to touch any of these [cannabis-related] things.
California
Companies, businesses and nonprofits that are offering free supplies, resources and services to victims of the Los Angeles-area fires.
“And with 100,000 to 150,000 people evacuated, any number of those would be people who are regular users of cannabis and likely many medical patients who really rely on it,” he said.
Last week, drop boxes were set up at at six local dispensaries, and the call went out to the cannabis community in search of unused dab rigs, bongs, vaporizers, pipes, rolling trays, grinders, odor-proof storage bags, pouches and containers, joint rollers and cone fillers, rolling papers, lighters and cleaning supplies for fire evacuees.
“Basically we can accept anything except hemp-based products or THC, which is for legal reasons,” Schmidt said.
Under state law, dispensaries are prohibited from giving away cannabis products, and the only ones they can legally sell need to go through theMetrc track-and-trace program. Schmidt estimates that to date, $2,000 worth of gear has been collected.
Lifestyle
In response to L.A.’s still-raging wildfires, hairstylists and barbers are offering free hair services to affected Angelenos.
Impacted local residents hoping to replace that lost vape battery, pipe, stash jar or grinder can do so free of charge by heading to one of six West Hollywood dispensaries serving as distribution points:CalmaWest Hollywood (1155 N. La Brea Ave.),MedMen West Hollywood(8208 Santa Monica Blvd.),PleasureMed(7715 Santa Monica Blvd.),Urbn Leaf(8477 Sunset Blvd.),the Woods WeHo(8271 Santa Monica Blvd.) andthe Artist Tree West Hollywood(8625 Santa Monica Blvd.) during regular business hours. (Schmidt said the dispensaries will cross reference addresses on valid, government-issued IDs — which are already required to enter a dispensary — with a list of fire-affected ZIP Codes to confirm eligibility.)
Lifestyle
With creative canna-cocktails now and new kitchen offerings to come, the Artist Tree’s second consumption lounge is L.A.’s first legal weed lounge outside of West Hollywood.
In addition, the dispensaries with consumption lounges (the Artist Tree, the Woods and PleasureMed) are waiving cover charges and minimum purchase requirements for displaced card-carrying medical marijuana patients who want to smoke or vape on-site through Feb. 28. That’s an effort to smooth out another wrinkle caused by the disconnect between state and federal law, Schmidt said.
“Federal rules prohibit cannabis patients from consuming — or even possessing — cannabis in [Federal Emergency Management Agency] housing,” he said. “So if you’re receiving FEMA assistance for housing — funding to stay in a hotel or to rent an apartment — you can’t [legally] consume there.”
A FEMA FAQ published in 2019in the aftermath of the 2018 California wildfires confirms the prohibition against cannabis use in its manufactured housing units and temporary housing, but doesn’t specifically address transitional shelter assistance, which funds short-term hotel stays and the like. Calls and emails on Wednesday to confirm further with FEMA were not returned as of press time.
For those interested in donating items, those distribution sites also serve as drop-off sites. “As for what we’re looking for, everything from the very big to the very little,” Schmidt said. “Dab rigs and gravity bongs are very expensive products, but pipes can start at five to $10. And there’s [also the need for] grinders, rolling trays and rolling papers — all those little things people usually have to pay for.”
California
Officials warn of possible fraudulent GoFundMe accounts, the platform explains its verification process and experts share guidance on GoFundMe fundraisers.
Additional aid efforts in the cannabis space include L.A.-based accessories maker Puffco’soffer to replace deviceslost in the fires,a wildfire relief sesh and mixerat the Artist Tree Studio Cannabis Lounge on Friday (100% of the $20 ticket price and event purchases will benefit wildfire victims),a pledge by the Artist Treeto match up to $25,000 in donations to theCalifornia Community Foundation’s Wildfire Recovery Fundandthe United Cannabis Community Fire Relief Fund, a centralized GoFundMe campaign launched by Sacramento-based dispensary chainEmbarcto benefit World Central Kitchen.

State senator retains key role over fire insurance laws despite cannabis corruption probe,https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2025-01-30/insurance-committee-chair-corruption-probe,2025-01-30,"State Sen. Susan Rubio, a Democrat from Baldwin Park, was reappointed last week as chair of the committee that oversees insurance-related legislation, a powerful position that went unoccupied for weeks while swaths ofLos Angeles burned.
Even as the fires created anunprecedented insurance crisisthat has leftthousandsscrambling to cover their losses, Senate Pro Tem Mike McGuire (D-North Coast) kept the chairperson position vacant despiteannouncingall other leadership positions earlier in the month.
Rubio’s reappointment as chair, a position she has held since 2019, comes amid lingering questions about her role in an ongoing federal investigation into an alleged cannabis industry bribery scheme that dates to her time on the Baldwin Park City Council and her 2018 campaign for state office.
McGuire previously said he was awaiting more information from the U.S. attorney’s office regarding the federal inquiry before deciding whether Rubio should retain the chair position.
Rubio has not been named by authorities in connection with the case, but The Times previously reported on court documentsmade publicby the U.S. attorney’s office in December that described an unnamed public official with details that matched the state senator’s profile.
California
Newly unsealed documents suggest that state Sen. Susan Rubio was involved in a cannabis bribery scheme when she served on the Baldwin Park City Council and campaigned for the Legislature in 2018.
For the record:
4:09 p.m. Feb. 2, 2025An earlier version of this story said Baldwin Park’s former city manager pleaded guilty in connection with a cannabis corruption scheme. The plea was from the City of Commerce’s former city manager.
Baldwin Park’s former city attorney and Commerce’s city manager have both pleaded guilty to soliciting kickbacks in exchange for issuing permits to cannabis businesses. The unnamed official who fits Rubio’s description is accused of taking $30,000 in cash in exchange for protecting the scheme, with money allegedly funneled into a state campaign account through straw donors.A Rubio spokesperson, Matthew Z’berg, previously said in a statement that federal officials had informed Rubio she is not a target in the investigation, and that she “volunteered hours of her time” aiding the authorities in their investigation. Her office did not respond on whether she was the unnamed official in the plea. A spokesperson for the U.S. attorney’s office said he could neither confirm nor deny those claims.
With a district that includes parts of the San Gabriel Valley devastated by the Eaton fire, Rubio said as chairperson she will continue to dedicate time to help with the recovery.
“Following the appointment last Friday, Senators are meeting to discuss the work to be done,” Rubio said in a statement. “After having the opportunity to meet with all members of the committee, we’ll solidify and highlight the next steps forward for California and to support those impacted by the wildfires in being made whole.”
The Senate insurance committee chairperson role “carries considerable weight,” said Chris Micheli, an adjunct professor at the McGeorge School of Law and veteran lobbyist.
Micheli, who closely tracks legislative actions, said the committee is likely to tackle issues of affordability and eligibility on the homeowners front — issues that could shape the fire insurance market going forward. He said that “right now, [Rubio] is the most qualified individual to lead that committee,” and noted that the federal investigation probably had no bearing on her reappointment because she has not been directly implicated.
As a state legislator, and during herunsuccessful bidfor Congress, Rubio hasaccepted sizable donationsfrom the insurance industry, and so have her colleagues.
Although those donations are legal, that money is often from the same people who lobby for bills heard before the Insurance Committee. Rubio’s role gives her the power to advance or kill legislation that could either harm or benefit the industry. Lisa Calderon (D-Los Angeles), the chairperson of the Assembly Insurance Committee, has also previously accepted donations from the industry.
McGuire, who oversaw Rubio’s reappointment, recently revealed his intent torun next year for state insurance commissioner, an elected positionthat helps regulatethe state’s insurance industry. The current commissioner is Ricardo Lara, who was elected in 2018.
California
After devastating fires in Los Angeles County, California lawmakers will consider changes to the state’s troubled insurance marketplace.
Jamie Court, president and chairman of Consumer Watchdog, said he is “very concerned” with Rubio’s appointment as California is in “an escalating crisis.”
“She’s given the insurance commissioner whatever he wants to do, which is screw up the system,” Court said. “The Insurance Committee is owned by the insurance industry and Susan Rubio is the gatekeeper.”
McGuire reaffirmed his support for Rubio in a statement issued last week.
“I have confidence in her experience and her ability to lead the Committee while the State faces unprecedented challenges with the insurance market,” he said.

"What to learn from rebuilding of Paradise after 2018 wildfire? Plenty, says top insurance executive",https://www.latimes.com/business/story/2025-01-30/mercury-executive-rebuilding-paradise-2018-wildfire-la-wildfires-eaton-palisades-camp-fire,2025-01-30,"The2018 Camp firethat destroyed most of the town of Paradise caused $12.5 billion in insured damages, making it the costliest wildfire in U.S. history. Now, the multiple Los Angeles County fires are expected to easily surpass that, raising questions about the future availability and affordability of homeowners insurance. Many who had lost homes in the fires had beendropped by their insurersbefore the disaster struck.
Last month, Mercury Insurance, one of the state’s largest homeowners carriers, offered a glimmer of hope when it said it would start writing new policies in the Sierra Nevada foothills community, still in the early stages of rebuilding with less density under a new building code intended to make it more fire resistant.
Mercury also disclosed  that it would have to absorb at least $150 million in losses from theLos Angeles fires, with one analyst this week pegging its losses possibly as high as $1.7 billion.
Nevertheless, Victor Joseph, president of the Los Angeles-based insurer and son of its founder, said the company remains committed to insuring homes in the state. In an interview, he discussed how Paradise’s reconstruction offers lessons for rebuilding after the Palisades and Eaton fires and steps that would make it more likely for insurers to offer policies.
Why would you start writing new policies in Paradise after the huge losses insurers suffered there?
It’s very different, the construction you see there now from how it was before the fires happened. If you go on something like Google Street View, and pull up the images of Paradise, it looks like a completely different city.
Business
Chubb expects that its losses from the L.A. County fires will total $1.5 billion, making the Swiss company the first major insurer to release such a figure.
What are the most important changes in the community?
First you have a kind of broad outlying area — how they’re managing fuel. And what we’ve seen with the science is once you get over 30 feet of separation between structures, you have much less concern about radiant heat as a factor in causing urban conflagrations. Then you have a number of codes and changes that they’ve made within the city. Companies like us put a lot of emphasis on what you have zero to five feet from your home.
People love to have shrubbery and trees near their homes.
They found a few sort of creative workarounds. They have little planters in the front yard or right against the house. And on windy days, what they do is they move them farther away from the home. So they found ways to create sort of this lifestyle or this aesthetic that is really sensitive and savvy as it relates to wildfire. So you don’t have to move towards some barren landscape or moonscape that is unattractive.
How can you get 30 feet of separation between structures?
There were a large chunk of folks who decided not to come back. Some of the folks who stayed ended up buying up lots of land that were near them.
Getting 30 feet of separation from structures might be more challenging in dense communities such as Pacific Palisades and Altadena, even if some residents don’t return.
It’s easier when you’re starting with a blank slate. You don’t want the blank slate to be there in the first place, but unfortunately, now you have two more places in California where that’s the case.
Business
A.B. 238, which would make it easy for victims of the Los Angeles County wildfires to get mortgage relief, will proceed despite voluntary agreements Gov. Newsom reached with hundreds of lenders.
Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass has ordered building permits to be expedited and Gov. Gavin Newsom has suspended certain elements of the California Environmental Quality Act. Plus, there is a huge need for housing in Los Angeles and the pressure will be on to increase density.
I think people have to maybe pause just for a beat and think about, do you want to build back exactly the same way? Because if you do, we’re going to be having this conversation again in a few decades.
Are there other ways that an urban community could improve its fire resilience short of depopulating and creating large fire breaks between homes?
I do think there are a few developments in Orange County that provide some inspiration on how you can do that well. There’s a famous one called Orchard Hills. When the Silverado fire came [in 2020], that was being blown by some pretty strong winds and they did very well — even though the homes are close together. They designed it with the Orange County Fire Authority to be ready for an ember storm.
So what was done in Orchard Hills?
They designed the terrain around the community, the landscape, in a way where embers would be more likely to fly over the community rather than into it. They’ve designed a wall around the community that is meant to help with embers. All the homes on the outer edge of the community are built to a standard with a real fixation on being a line of defense for ember storms. If that first layer of homes is ignited, you’ve already sort of lost the battle.
California
As the cleanup phase of recovery begins after the devastating fires in L.A. County, displaced residents grapple with new uncertainty surrounding the cost and timeline for rebuilding.
How do you build homes to a higher standard?
It’s pretty uncommon nowadays to see a roof or siding that you’d be too concerned about. Stucco is very common and that’s fine. So it comes back to that zero-to-five foot space, ember resistant vents with smaller mesh screens, and then if they’ve got a deck or something elevated that’s combustible — or it’s a place where embers can kind of sneak under and gather and ignite — you really need to seal those off.
Business
California’s Fair Plan, the state’s insurer of last resort, may be unable to pay billions in claims arising from the Los Angeles fires and may require a bailout that could ultimately be paid by homeowners statewide.
Well that’s doable.
My hope is that we’ll build back something that maybe takes a few pages out of the book of Paradise, and maybe Orchard Hills and other newer communities.
What do you think is the cause of the destructive fires we have seen in California? Talking climate change can be politically tricky these days.
Well, what I would say is the year 2000 in my mind represents a clear transition in things like vapor pressure deficit, that feeds  into vegetation being a lot drier in California. I don’t see any indication that that’s anything other than human-driven climate change. Whether it’s the primary cause [of the fires], I’m not really comfortable saying, but I do think it’s something we certainly feel is a part of the problem.
Unlike some other insurers, Mercury has not made news for non-renewals. In fact, you reached a deal to offer insurance to policyholders of Tokio Marine America and its subsidiary when they exited the state’s homeowners market last year. Why is that?
Most of our business is in California. We don’t have a position that we can take, like other companies, where we just say, “Let’s pause in California. Let’s forget it.” Three-quarters of our employees live here, so one way or another, we’re going to figure this out.

The L.A. wildfires left neighborhoods choking in ash and toxic air. Residents demand answers,https://www.latimes.com/environment/story/2025-01-30/la-wildfires-hazardous-waste-cleanup,2025-01-30,"Nearly two weeks after the Eaton fire forced Claire Robinson to flee her Altadena home, she returned, donning a white hazmat suit, a respirator and goggles.
The brick chimneys were among the few recognizable features of the quaint three-bedroom 1940 house neighboring Farnsworth Park. Nearly everything else was reduced to ashes.
The scorching heat melted the glass awards her daughter had received for her theater performances, leaving behind deformed globs of crystal. Where her washer and dryer once stood, Robinson found only a blackened metal frame. The flames even managed to consume her cast-iron bathtub.
“The screws were the only thing that didn’t vaporize,” Robinson said after she scoured through the debris. “Everything else is in the air.
“How do we live in this highly toxic environment and make sure that people aren’t being sent back to their homes prematurely?” she said. “Families are just being told, ‘You’re clear to go in.’ They’re callingusand saying, ‘Is it safe?’ I’m like, ‘I don’t know.’”
Tens of thousands of wildfire survivors, including Robinson, have returned to ash-cloaked neighborhoods, even as serious questions about what could be lurking in the debris remain unanswered.
Environmental regulators and public health officials have warned survivors that fire-damaged neighborhoods are probably brimming with toxic chemicals and harmful substances, such asbrain-damaging leadandlung-scarring asbestos fibers. Air monitors have measured elevated levels ofheavy metals miles downwindof the wildfires.
However, despite the dire warnings from environmental and health officials, fire officials and law enforcement have decided to reopen large swaths of the evacuation zones before disaster personnel could sweep residential communities for some of the most dangerous materials — such as firearm ammunition, propane tanks, pesticides, paint thinner and car batteries.
The EPA’s hazardous waste cleanup was initially projected to last three months. Earlier this week, President Trump signed a federal directive to shorten the cleanup time to 30 days, prompting EPA officials to increase the number of personnel and teams assigned to the hazmat response, and accelerate the process.
Meanwhile, the Army Corps of Engineers’ debris removal was expected to take 18 months. After Trump’s recent visit to L.A., the Army Corps  now says it can be done in a year.
“Once a crew shows up to a property, depending on the complexity of that site, it can take two to ten days to clear the debris from that site,” said Col. Eric Swenson of the Corps. “It just really depends on how fast we get those rights of entry.”
As the monumental work of cleaning up the burned zones begins, Robinson and others say they would like to have clearer guidance and support from government agencies to keep people safe from toxic materials.
I think it’s unbelievable that people are being told just to go ahead and go back in.
— Claire Robinson, Altadena resident
Robinson said she thinks it’s alarming that many people have been returning to their destroyed homes without wearing protective gear, and have not been adequately warned about the risks as they begin to clean up their contaminated properties.
“We know that it’s all combusted, and it’s all in the air — metals, plastics. I think it’s unbelievable that people are being told just to go ahead and go back in,” Robinson said. “There’s a lack of coordinated, comprehensive expert response.”
This week, officials from the federal Environmental Protection Agency supervised specialized crews as they began collecting these substances, the first step in what is expected to be a yearlong, multibillion-dollar cleanup and recovery.
As of Wednesday morning, the EPA-led personnel had conducted preliminary surveys of about 2,500 of an estimated 14,500 fire-damaged properties. These crews have been collecting and removing hazardous waste only since Monday. After two days, they had cleared a total of three homes — marking the properties with laminated placards fixed on wooden posts.
“As places were being [reopened], we had to take a different strategy,” said Harry Allen, an on-scene coordinator for the EPA. “Most fires, we haven’t had [people returning] this early. Because we’re in L.A., it’s really important that people are able to return. … So in this case, as Cal Fire lifted evacuation zones, we said, ‘Let’s get in there, let’s do recon as quickly as we can in advance of repopulation.’”
In California, where electric vehicles and plug-in hybrids make up more than one-quarter of car sales, the U.S. EPA has had to exercise extreme caution around an estimated 1,000 fire-damaged, lithium-ion car batteries — perhaps the most ever damaged by a wildfire. These batteries — also used in e-bikes, scooters and small electronics — have been known to ignite, explode or release toxic gases when exposed to extreme heat or fire.
It’s probably going to be the biggest lithium-ion battery removal activity that’s taken place in this country, if not the world.
— Steve Canalog, deputy incident commander for EPA Region 9
“It’s probably going to be the biggest lithium-ion battery removal activity that’s taken place in this country, if not the world,” said Steve Canalog, deputy incident commander for EPA Region 9, who has overseen cleanups of wildfires, floods, earthquakes and chemical spills.
“Just the high heat can damage the integrity of these battery systems, and they become very unstable and have the risk of spontaneously catching on fire and exploding,” Canalog said. “We have to treat them as unexploded ordnance.”
Because of the risk, EPA personnel transport each battery individually to processing areas. The batteries are often soaked in a saltwater bath to drain the remaining power, and are eventually shredded and taken to recycling facilities.
Hazmat crews typically hear popping and hissing sounds from damaged lithium-ion batteries. In neighborhoods where homes are only a few dozen feet apart, the EPA is telling residents that they shouldmaintain a football-field-length distancefrom such batteries to avoid injury.
“At the end of the day, you can’t put out a lithium-ion battery fire. It burns so hot and energetically, and you can’t put it out with water or sand or fire blankets. The firefighting strategy is just to let it burn,” Canalog said.
On Wednesday morning, EPA-contracted crews fanned out across a fully razed block in Altadena.
Personnel wore white hazmat suits, blue latex gloves, black sunglasses and respirators as they navigated around a burned-out panel van and blackened metal bed frame. The workers sifted through the ash and debris left in the footprint of a house on Pine Street with shovels and hand tools until they discovered hazardous waste.
One worker carefully held the charred remnants of an iPhone between his index finger and thumb, gently placing it into a black trash bag held by a colleague. Soon after, another approached with his hands full.
“These are all batteries,” he said as he dropped about 20 scorched cylinders into a 5-gallon bucket one by one.
Earlier in the week, another crew extracted a lithium-ion battery from the husk of a Tesla sedan next door. They placed fire-damaged compressed-gas tanks in a row on the front lawn and marked each canister with a white “X,” an indication the fuel had already been burnt.
The EPA has been gathering EV batteries and other hazardous materials found on wrecked properties and moving them to two processing areas: a site near Topanga Beach, where the Santa Monica Mountains meet the Pacific Ocean, for Palisades fire debris; and a site in Lario Park near the foothills of the San Gabriel Mountains in unincorporated Irwindale for Altadena waste. There, EPA crews sort the materials before they’re transported to landfills — exactly where is still unknown.
The decision to stockpile hazardous waste in Lario Park sparked swift backlash from residents and public officials. Four nearby cities — Duarte, Azusa, Irwindale and Baldwin Park — have lodged official complaints arguing that transporting hazardous substances 15 miles outside the Eaton fire and into a popular recreation area poses a risk to thousands more.
“The wildfires that have ravaged Los Angeles County must be cleaned up, but I cannot understand how trucking hazardous waste through so many vulnerable communities, and placing near homes and schools, is the best possible option,” said Michael Cao, mayor of Arcadia, another city near the site.
The EPA has not responded to the complaints, but agency officials said its crews have installed liners to prevent toxic chemicals from leaching into soil. They will also conduct soil testing after their work has concluded.
The EPA’s hazardous waste removal alone is expected to take several months. Once that work is completed, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers will step up for the second phase: the removal of ash and debris from properties whoseowners have signed up for free cleanup, which is expected to take up to 18 months. Property owners can also opt to hire specialized private contractors if they choose to pay the cost themselves.
Although the smoke and ash from any wildfire are considered harmful, urban wildfires are especially dangerous. The smoke and ash from structures and cars can contain more than a hundredtoxic chemicals and poisonous gases, according to state officials. Perhaps the most notable is lead, a heavy metal — which has no safe level of exposure for anyone, and which can permanently stunt the development of children when inhaled or ingested.
During the 2018 Camp fire in Paradise, elevated levels of airborne lead lingered for longer than a day. The metal-infused pollution traveled more than 150 miles and was measured as far away as San Jose and Modesto.
On Jan. 7, as the L.A. County wildfires broke out, air samples measured“highly elevated levels”of lead and arsenic over a dozen miles downwind of the Eaton fire, according to the South Coast Air Quality Management District. The highest concentration was recorded in Vernon, about 13 miles southwest.
Separately, a Los Angeles-based air quality monitor supported by federal funding showed thathourly measurements of airborne lead spikedon Jan. 8 and 9, when smoke from the Eaton fire cast a pall from Altadena to San Pedro.
As the Eaton fire approached the home of Felipe Carrillo, he urged his wife and two children to evacuate while he stayed behind to protect the home with a garden hose fitted with a high-pressure nozzle. For hours, Carrillo said, he tried to defend their home by preemptively spraying water onto the roof and later extinguishing small fires sparked by the onslaught of wind-driven embers.
By the next day, his was one of the few homes left standing on the block. It wasn’t until a week later that it dawned on Carrillo that he should also be worried about the smoke and toxic chemicals he was exposed to in the overnight firefight — which he waged without any protective gear.
“In that moment, it was fight or die,” Carrillo said.
After things calmed down, he went to see a doctor, who monitored his breathing for any signs of fluid buildup.
“They told me, you know, unfortunately, there’s no way of knowing any effects that may linger from the fact that you fought a fire without a mask or anything,” Carrillo said.
Ahead of the recent rainfall, Carrillo returned to the house to put sandbags around the perimeter of his property to keep ash from drifting onto the property. He’s also temporarily moved his family out of Altadena out of worry that his 14-year-old son and 10-year-old daughter could inhale the same toxic chemicals that he may have already been exposed to. In addition to the recent strong winds that have whipped up dust, Carrillo fears the ensuing cleanup will also kick up contaminants.
Army Corps of Engineers officials said they would spray water and mist on wildfire ash and debris to reduce the risk of airborne contaminants during their cleanup, but Carillo remains concerned.
“What about these dust storms that they’re gonna cause?” Carrillo said. “Let’s say my kids are in the backyard playing football and this big bulldozer kicks up a lot of dust and my kids inhale it?”
Some of the most concerning toxic contamination could be from older buildings. Lead-based paint and asbestos-containing construction materials were commonly used in homes until they were banned in the late 1970s. About 86% of the buildings near the Eaton fire, and 74% near the Palisades fire, were built before 1980, according to Cal Fire.
For Jane Williams, executive director of the nonprofit California Communities Against Toxics, the copious amounts of ash and rubble hearken back to the aftermath of the Sept. 11 attacks on the World Trade Center. In the months that followed, first responders and residents were exposed to a hazardous mix of asbestos, silica dust, heavy metals and other dangerous substances.
As the years passed, many of those affected by the devastation at Ground Zero were diagnosed with long-term health issues such as asthma, diminished lung function and other respiratory problems.
Over the course of January 2025, Williams watched in dread as social media videos and news coverage emerged showing Southern California residents whose homes had been destroyed sifting through the rubble unmasked.
This is the disaster after the disaster.
— Jane Williams, executive director of California Communities Against Toxics
“It’s exactly what happened with the Twin Towers,” Williams said. “This is the disaster after the disaster. Tens of thousands of people will go back to their properties, and most of them will not wear masks.”
At this point, little is known about the contaminants lingering in the wildfire ash in Altadena and Pacific Palisades. The August 2023 fire in Maui similarly incinerated residential communities composed largely of older housing. After that wildfire was quelled, experts found thatash contained a myriad of heavy metals, including lead, arsenic, copper and cobalt.
The L.A. fires have also led to concerns about water contamination. Water districts in Altadena and the Pacific Palisades/Malibu area have issued“do not drink” advisoriesfor some areas. Suppliers that manage these water systems are assessing impacts of the fires, making repairs and testing for contamination.
According to theState Water Resources Control Board, these advisories “were issued as a precautionary measure until the condition of the system could be determined.” That said, the board’s website also notes that while building materials can contain chemicals that may contaminate water runoff from burned areas, this generally does not affect drinking water supplies, which are protected from exposure as long as infrastructure wasn’t directly damaged.
Completing the extensive cleanup efforts in the burned areas of L.A. will probably take years. In the meantime, residents — not just in the neighborhoods that burned but those nearby too — wonder how to protect themselves.
For example, Garo Manjikian evacuated from his Pasadena home with his wife and three children as the Eaton fire exploded. The family returned to find their house and garden covered in a layer of ash.
They spent days cleaning the house; washing their clothes, bedding and rugs; and throwing away pillows that had absorbed smoke. Manjikian said he hosed ash off the roof and out of the gutters, and power-washed the outside walls. Inside, he used the power washer and a shop vac to clean out ash that had collected in the windowsills.
I decided to just do everything I can myself to remove the ash.
— Garo Manjikian, Pasadena resident
“I decided to just do everything I can myself to remove the ash,” said Manjikian, who rented three industrial air purifiers and ran them in the house for about a week. “I still don’t for sure know how toxic it still might be in the house, but at this point, there is no more smell of smoke.”
But fine ash continued to float down, coating the house and the yard. Manjikian and his wife have been urging their three sons, the oldest aged 8 and the twins aged 5, not to play outside. And when they do have to leave the house, the boys are getting used to wearing masks again, like they did during the pandemic.
Manjikian has heard that some homeowners, schools and businesses have been paying for lab tests out of their own pockets to determine what types of contaminants need to be cleaned up. He said it would be helpful if the results of those tests could be made available for him and others who might have been exposed to hazardous waste.
“If they do the testing and find out there’s toxic material there, that would be good information for the neighboring houses to have, whether it came back positive on the toxic particles or negative,” Manjikian said.
For Robinson, the Altadena resident whose home was destroyed in the Eaton fire, the disaster has brought multiple layers of grief and unanswered questions.
Robinson is the founder of Amigos de los Rios, a nonprofit group, and already knew the importance of wearing protective gear to guard against hazardous materials during river cleanups and park construction projects.
When she returned to inspect the ruins of her home, as well as the group’s nearby office, which also was destroyed, she and her husband spent about $250 at a hardware store buying two disposable coverall suits, nitrile gloves and leather gloves to go over them, plus multiple packages of goggles, booties and N100 masks.
Robinson said she thinks L.A. County officials should be doing much more to help residents understand the risks and to protect themselves. Residents shouldn’t be left in the dark, she said, about how much danger they might encounter as they sift through the ashes.
“I would expect there to be a much more concerted, organized, comprehensive effort to share information,” she said, and also to provide protective gear for those who can’t afford to buy it.
Robinson is also concerned about the health effects. Recently, she has had difficulty breathing unlike anything she remembers. At times, she feels tightness in her chest, and experiences a fit of coughing and wheezing.
She said it’s crucial that as others return to inspect their devastated neighborhood, they take measures to protect themselves.
“I’m less concerned about looting,” Robinson said, “than I am about people being exposed to these things and facing short, medium and long-term health impacts.”

These House newcomers came to the Capitol with big plans. Then the wildfires hit,https://www.latimes.com/politics/story/2025-01-30/california-house-newcomers-wildfires,2025-01-30,"WASHINGTON —Rep. Luz Rivashad barely begun her day in Washington when her cellphone rang at 7 a.m.The Hurst firehad erupted around 10:30 the night before and — fueled by high winds and dangerously dry conditions — ballooned to more than 500 acres in her northern Los Angeles County district by morning.
On the line wasRep. George Whitesides, her new neighboring congressional colleague, who was already rushing to Ronald Reagan National Airport that Jan. 8 morning for the first flight back to Los Angeles.
“Are you planning to go? Are you staying?” she recalled him asking. “Let’s coordinate.”
The two agreed that Whitesides would immediately start on-the-ground outreach to folks affected by the Hurst fire, which broke out in Sylmar and bordered their districts. Rivas would make calls to the Federal Emergency Management Agency and the White House.
She took a later flight to Los Angeles to join him and Rep. Laura Friedman, another newcomer to Congress, whose district borders Rivas’ and was surrounded by infernos. They had been sworn in as members of Congress just five days earlier.
“All three of us, that was our first instinct: We have to be home. We have to go assess the damage, we have to see what the community needs. And then come back with, what can we do together?” Rivas said in an interview in her Washington office.
“While it’s not what I envisioned for week one or month one, I felt prepared and ready,” Rivas added. “That’s why we get elected, right? To serve our constituents and to be there for what they need from the federal government. And I felt the L.A. delegation has done that.”
The Democratic trio knew each other before coming to Washington. Rivas and Whitesidescampaignedtogether last year. Friedman and Rivas served in the California Legislature together. Now the three freshman Congress members have a partnership literally forged by fire.
Politics
Veteran Reps. Pete Aguilar (D-Redlands) and Ted Lieu (D-Torrance) hold the positions of Democratic Caucus chair and vice chair, respectively.
Rivas had anticipated a little time to get used to her Washington digs. She intended to rearrange the sitting area in her office and hang art on the walls. Three weeks in, the walls remained bare. A “New Members Orientation” memento candle on the side table was unlit.
Rivas and Friedman hadn’t completed hiring their congressional staffs in their rush “to get the doors open and get the phones working,” to help constituents, Friedman said.
After eight years in the Legislature, Friedman faced her new job in Congress with the mindset that she could “walk in feeling that I can do the job.”
“But what I thought was going to be a more typical transition, of course, was interrupted by the devastating fires that have traumatized my community in Los Angeles,” Friedman said. “So my focus has had to shift, as many others have, towards support and recovery. But I feel very determined to be able to do that work.”
An engineer by trade, Rivas had campaigned on climate change resiliency. She went from chairing the California Assembly’s Committee on Natural Resources to joining the same committee in the U.S. House. Now, she is clear-eyed that the wildfire recovery will take up much of her time and attention for her two-year tenure in Congress.
“We’ve gone through several big wildfires in California while I was a legislator, and so it’s not completely new to me,” Rivas said. “[But] I didn’t envision this to be the focus of, like, week one.”
The most destructive fires this season — the Palisades and Eaton fires — took place in the districts of veteran Congress members Brad Sherman (D-Sherman Oaks) and Judy Chu (D-Monterey Park), who in another January weathereda mass shootingat a ballroom in her district.
But whole swaths of northern Los Angeles County were also torched and blanketed by smoke. Whitesides’ district, the 27th, includes the Santa Clarita Valley. To the south and east is Rivas’ 29th District. That, in turn, abuts Friedman’s 30th District, which is centered on Burbank.
“We haven’t seen the vast structure loss that we’ve seen in Altadena and the Palisades, but that’s kind of just like dodging a bullet. It is a matter of time before we have our own next wildland fire,” said Whitesides in a phone interview on Jan. 15.
A week later, the Hughes fire erupted in his district.
California
As the cleanup phase of recovery begins after the devastating fires in L.A. County, displaced residents grapple with new uncertainty surrounding the cost and timeline for rebuilding.
The California fires have baptized the new lawmakers in Washington politics. They coincided with a torrent of executive orders from President Trump — including several that Friedman said could hamper California’s recovery.
“We can’t hire firefighters to keep California safe,” Friedman said, noting Trump’s hiring freeze on federal workers. “We’re not going to be able to hire enough people to remove debris and build new houses. So there’s profound ramifications to the policies that are being designed without Democrats.”
The fires were still raging when House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) first floated the possibility of tying future federal funding for California’s disaster to conditions, such as forcing the state to observe strict voter ID laws.
The House Democratic Caucus — led by California Reps. Pete Aguilar (D-Redlands) and Ted Lieu (D-Torrance) — swiftly pounced on the suggestion, reminding Johnson that conditions were not added to funding for previous disasters. Days into her tenure in Congress, Rivas joined her party’s senior leaders for a news conference in the Capitol.
“Constituents who evacuated and were unsure if their home was still standing called my office and asked how they could help their neighbors,” Rivas said. “This is what L.A. is about, and it is what my California congressional delegation colleagues on both sides of the aisle know to be true. … This isn’t about party or politics. It’s about getting our constituents the resources that they need to rebuild their lives in the wake of this disaster.”
Friendman echoed the comments later, saying, “It’s really wonderful to be here and see how close the California delegation is.”
Group text message chains abound, with lawmakers sharing articles, updates, meeting times and locations.
In the few weeks since taking office, Rivas, Friedman and Whitesides have pushed for legislation dealing with wildfires or disaster response — including joining their San Diego neighbor and fellow Democrat, Rep. Sara Jacobs, tointroduce legislationto streamline the bureaucracy of federal disaster response.
Whitesides, who co-founded the organization Megafire Action, also co-sponsored theFix Our Forests Act— a sweeping piece of legislation that passed the House last week.
“Unfortunately, this is what I ran on,” Whitesides said. “Every campaign event that I did over the last two years, I would talk about my fear that we would have a wildland-initiated fire that would sweep down into a dense community and set off a house-to-house conflagration. And I did not expect that we would get not just one, but two massive examples of that on my first week. That’s exactly why I ran.
“Now,” he hastily added, “is it the only reason I ran? No. I want to solve all kinds of problems.”
But for Whitesides, Rivas and Friedman, their tenure in Congress is already being defined by fire and, perhaps when reelection comes around, determined by it too.

L.A. fires wreaked havoc on the land. Scientists are racing to learn what they’ve done to the sea,https://www.latimes.com/science/story/2025-01-29/scientists-have-been-testing-ocean-waters-for-decades-theyve-never-seen-it-like-this,2025-01-29,"The Reuben Lasker was about four miles off the coast of Manhattan Beach when ash began to rain upon the sea — first in delicate flurries, then in noxious clouds.
The fisheries research vessel had set sail days earlier for a coastal survey. It was supposed to be a routine voyage, the kind that theCalifornia Cooperative Oceanic Fisheries Investigations (CalCOFI)program embarks upon four times a year as part of the world’s longest-running marine ecosystem monitoring effort.
But when the Palisades and Eaton fires broke out, scientists aboard the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration ship inadvertently became the first investigators on the scene of a brewing disaster that could upend life underwater.
The smoke that has choked Los Angeles, the debris piled up along decimated streets, the charred and  toxic remnants of thousands of destroyed homes, businesses, cars and electronics — nearly all of it, eventually, will come to rest in the ocean.
There is no precedent for how an urban fire of this magnitude could change the ecosystem that countless species, including our own, rely on for food and sustenance.
But there’s also no team better equipped to understand how the fires that transformed Los Angeles will affect life in the sea.
Unlike the smoke that emanates from rural wildfires, the charred material now entering the ocean is the stuff of “people’s homes: their cars, their batteries, their electronics,” said Rasmus Swalethorp, a biological oceanographer at UC San Diego’s Scripps Institution of Oceanography. “It’s certainly going to contain a lot of things that we ideally don’t want to see in our oceans — and in our soils, for that matter, and our water streams, and certainly not on our dinner plates.”
CalCOFI was formed in 1949 to study the collapse of the sardine industry, in a joint effort by Scripps, NOAA Fisheries and state fish and wildlife officials.
But scientists quickly realized that question could only be answered by studying the interconnected layers of the broader marine ecosystem.
CalCOFI began to methodically collect detailed ocean samples from the same 113 locations multiple times a year, along a systematic grid that spans the California coast. Millions of samples of plankton, fish eggs and marine animals have since been preserved in its archives, providing invaluable snapshots of the ocean over time.
As this month’s fires raged on land, the Reuben Lasker continued that orderly lawnmower-style route through the sea. Its researchers from Scripps and NOAA’s Southwest Fisheries Science Center donned goggles and masks. Wildlife counts were temporarily suspended when the smoke became too thick to make out seabirds and marine mammals.
Fire debris clouded the ocean’s surface as far as 100 miles offshore. Once-white collection nets came up blackened with soot and charred detritus. As the team hauled up samples of ash-filled seawater, Swalethorp recoiled at the odor, which was unlike that of any wildfire smoke he’d encountered before.
“It didn’t have your typical bonfire smell to it,” said Swalethorp, who runs CalCOFI’s ship operations. “The first thing that sprang to my mind when I smelled it, and immediately pulled away, was: this smells like burned electronics.”
A typical CalCOFI cruise collects data on everything from water clarity to local plant and animal species. The program’s decades-long data archives make it ideal for studying long-term changes to marine ecosystems.
“I don’t think there’s a precedent for this kind of input into the ocean ecosystem,” NOAA Fisheries’ CalCOFI Director Noelle Bowlin said of the fires. But with 76 years of data to measure against, “we can provide the context needed to answer the question of, how big of a perturbation is this event?”
The samples collected at the start of the fires can help provide much-needed answers on whether higher concentrations of toxic metals, PCBs, PFAS and other forever chemicals will wind up in the ocean — and for how long, said Mark Gold, an environmental scientist at the Natural Resources Defense Council.
“It’s so serendipitous, having CalCOFI being there literally during the catastrophe and being able to collect such extensive samples,” Gold said.
Among the most immediate concerns is ocean water contamination. In addition to the already-massive footprint of ash offshore, Gold noted that runoff from the first few rainstorms is a huge concern. He’s had a flurry of conversations with city, county and state officials, who have been trying to proactively limit the amount of fire pollution going into the ocean.
Imagine Los Angeles County, framed by foothills and mountains, as a giant bowl tilted toward the sea. Whenever it rains, water rushes off rooftops and down streets and sidewalks, picking up any pesticides, trash,car tire residueand other contaminants in its way.
Unlike the region’s sewage, which is filtered through treatment facilities before it’s discharged, this mix of rainwater and debris usually flushes straight into the ocean through a massivenetwork of storm drainsand concrete-lined rivers.
The rain this week was the first significant precipitation in the region since May. In addition to the fires’ ash and chemical residue, it was also the first flush of nine months’ worth of daily pollution into the sea.
Local environmental groups like Heal the Bayhave urgedbeachgoers to avoid water contact at any beaches from Malibu’s Surfrider Beach down to Dockweiler State Beach near L.A. International Airport.
The Los Angeles County Department of Public Health has issuedsimilar ocean precautionsand evenbeach closures, along witha map of closed or contaminated beaches.
California
Although the beaches remain open, health advisories prohibit or urge residents to avoid swimming, surfing or playing in the ocean water because of debris runoff from fire zones.
Public health officials cautioned that even the sand may contain toxic or carcinogenic chemicals, advising beachgoers to avoid any fire debris and any runoff that may flow onto or pond on the beach sand. Gold, as an extra precaution, added that he wouldn’t swim or surf in the water for at least two or three weeks after it rains.
Longer term, there are serious questions about whether contaminants released by the fire will penetrate the food chain.
Ash from forest fires can sometimes boost the growth of phytoplankton, the microscopic algae at the base of the marine food web, thanks to the infusion of nutrients from burned plants. No one yet knows how a massive infusion of ash from urban fires — with its mix of asbestos, lead, microplastics and heavy metals — will affect our food supply.
“Is it going to be having an impact on all the food web interactions, starting with the base of the food chain, the phytoplankton and the microbes, and then slowly accumulating ... all the way up to the fish that we are eating?” said project leader Julie Dinasquet, a Scripps marine ecologist. “Maybe in a few months to a year, people are going to realize that there’s a bioaccumulation of heavy metals in [these fish], or something else from these fires.”
L.A.’s devastating fires are only the latest episode in which the ocean has served as an unappreciated receptacle for trash and hazards originating on land.
Climate & Environment
Scientists have found DDT in zooplankton and deep-sea fish off the coast of L.A., indicating the toxic chemical might be infiltrating the base of the food web.
Aseries of Times reportsin recent years have unraveled a haunting history of how the nation’s largest manufacturer of DDT hadonce dumped its wasteat sea, just off the coast of Los Angeles. Further research has since uncovered that this part of the ocean had also served as a dumping ground formilitary munitionsandradioactive waste.
“To me, the circumstances and the magnitude of these fires have shown that the L.A. region is not climate resilient at all,” Gold said. “One of the consequences of not being climate resilient … is that the ocean once again becomes a dumping ground, whether it’s intentional or not.”

Chubb reports L.A. County fire losses will hit $1.5 billion,https://www.latimes.com/business/story/2025-01-29/chubb-reports-los-angeles-fire-losses-will-hit-1-5-billion,2025-01-29,"Chubb Ltd. is estimating that it will need to pay out $1.5 billion to cover its Los Angeles County fire claims, making the Swiss insurer the first company to report its expected losses from the conflagrations.
Chairman and Chief Executive Evan Greenberg said the figure includes the cost of “supporting our customers and helping them recover and rebuild from this catastrophe,”according to a statementin the company’s fourth-quarter earnings report released Tuesday.
“The California wildfire disaster is a terrible tragedy that is still unfolding. Our colleagues have been on the ground from the beginning, endeavoring to assist our policyholders who have lost property, been displaced from their homes and businesses, and had their lives severely disrupted,” he said.
Chubb, which earned $2.6 billion in the fourth quarter,   said it anticipates the financial impact to the company will be limited to the first quarter of this year.
Business
California’s Fair Plan, the state’s insurer of last resort, may be unable to pay billions in claims arising from the Los Angeles fires and may require a bailout that could ultimately be paid by homeowners statewide.
The size of the loss to Chubb indicates just how large the damages will be for insurers. Chubb had a 2.27% share of the California homeowners market in 2023, putting it outside the top 10 largest home insurers in the state.
The Eaton and Palisades fires have consumed nearly 40,000 acres of homes, businesses and landmarks in Altadena and Pacific Palisades and have killed more than two dozen people.
Moody’s RMS said in a reportthis week that it expects the fires will weaken insurers first-quarter earnings and raise the price of reinsurance they buy to mitigate the costs of catastrophes — while increasing prices and lowering the availability of homeowners insurance in California neighborhoods at “high- and medium-risk” for wildfires.
That will continue to force more homeowners to get insurance from the FAIR Plan, the state’s already overloaded insurer of last resort, said the report from Moody’s. The state plan provides policies with lower limits that exclude some typical coverage.
Business
Some policyholders who suffered total losses in L.A. fires are not getting claims advances for their living expenses and loss of contents as required, Insurance Commissioner Ricardo Lara alleged Thursday.
While weather forecasting service AccuWeather puts the fires’ total economic lossat $250 billion to $275 billion, that figure includes the costs of healthcare, business disruptions and other economic impacts.
Risk modelers have estimated the cost to the insurance industry to pay for property damage, temporary housing costs and other claims at$20 billion to $45 billion. That would make the fires one of the country’s worst natural disasters but likely not as costly as Hurricane Katrina in 2005.

A $4-billion settlement for Hawaii wildfire victims is in legal limbo as an unusual trial starts,https://www.latimes.com/world-nation/story/2025-01-29/a-4b-settlement-for-hawaii-wildfire-victims-is-in-legal-limbo-as-an-unusual-trial-starts,2025-01-29,"HONOLULU —When Hawaii Gov. Josh Green announced a $4-billion settlement about a year after the deadliest U.S. wildfire in a century devastated Lahaina in 2023, he touted the speed of the deal to “avoid protracted and painful lawsuits.”
Five months later, however, an unusual trial starting Wednesday will delve into difficult questions about survivors’ losses as a judge decides how to divide the settlement. Some victims will take the witness stand, while others have submitted prerecorded testimony, describing pain made all the more fresh by the recent destruction in Los Angeles.
The trial won’t determine fault. Defendants blamed for the blaze including the state, power utility Hawaiian Electric and large landowners have already agreed to the settlement amount.
World & Nation
Hawaiians have faced a year of challenges since the deadliest U.S. wildfire in a century devastated the historic Maui town of Lahaina in 2023.
At issue is how much money various groups of plaintiffs might receive, including some who filed individual lawsuits after losing their family members, homes or businesses, and other victims covered by class-action lawsuits, including tourists who simply had to cancel trips to Maui following the inferno.
Lawyers for the two groups failed to come to an agreement, leaving it up to Judge Peter Cahill to determine how the $4 billion should be shared.
“A class action is everybody suffering the same loss,” said Damon Valverde, whose Lahaina sunglasses company burned. “And I suffered quite a bit more than others, and others suffered quite a bit more than me.”
Valverde isn’t expected to testify; the focus should be on victims who lost family members, he said.
Those include Kevin Baclig, whose wife, father-in-law, mother-in-law and brother-in-law were among the 102 people known to have died.
World & Nation
As many as one-third of people displaced by the August 2023 Maui fires wound up in the homes of friends and family in the weeks after the disaster.
Baclig said in a declaration that if called to testify he would describe how for three agonizing days he searched for them — from hotel to hotel, shelter to shelter. “I clung to the fragile hope that maybe they had made it off the island, that they were safe,” he said.
A month and a half went by and the grim reality set in. He went to the Philippines to gather DNA samples from his wife’s close relatives there. The samples matched remains found in the fire. He eventually carried urns holding their remains back to the Philippines.
“The loss has left me in profound, unrelenting pain,” he said. “There are no words to describe the emptiness I feel or the weight I carry every day.”
The class action includes some people who lost homes and businesses, but also tourists whose trips were delayed or canceled. Only a nominal portion of the settlement should go toward that group, said Jacob Lowenthal, one of the attorneys representing victims — like Baclig — who have filed their own lawsuits, known as the “individual plaintiffs.”
World & Nation
Based on a Times review of Maui records, government officials should have been aware of the fire danger Lahaina faced.
“The categories of losses that the class is claiming are just grossly insignificant compared to our losses,” Lowenthal said.
Attorneys representing the class didn’t respond to messages from the Associated Press. In their trial brief, they challenged the idea that everyone who has a claim worth suing over has already done so. Many people have held off hiring attorneys, the brief said, because of the fire’s disruption to life, “distrust in heavy attorney advertising, and a desire to see how the process plays out first.”
Further complicating the matter are questions before the state Supreme Court, which is considering whether insurers can separately sue the defendants for reimbursement for the $2 billion-plus they have paid out as a result of the fire, or whether their share must come from the $4-billion settlement.
If the court says insurers can sue separately, that will likely torpedo the entire deal. Preventing insurers from going after the defendants is a key settlement term, and allowing them to do so would drain the money available for fire victims and lead to prolonged litigation, lawyers for the individual plaintiffs say.

Edison wants to raise rates to pay for wildfires linked to its equipment,https://www.latimes.com/environment/story/2025-01-29/edison-wants-customers-to-pay-for-wildfires-its-equipment-caused,2025-01-29,"Southern California Edison is asking state regulators to make its customers cover more than $7 billion in damages it paid to the victims of two devastating wildfires in 2017 and 2018.
At its meeting Thursday, the California Public Utilities Commission will consider Edison’s request to pass on to its ratepayers $1.6 billion in damages from the 2017 Thomas wildfire in Santa Barbara and Ventura counties, one of the largest fires in state history.
The commission at a later date will consider a similar action that would tap Edison customers to cover $5.4 billion in damages from the 2018 Woolsey fire in Ventura and Los Angeles counties, which killed three people.
If both measures are approved, Edison customers will have a roughly 2% surcharge on their bills for the next 30 years, according to regulatory documents. That means the average monthly bill for a residential customer, now $177, would rise to $181.
Investigators found that Edison’s equipment ignited the Thomas and Woolsey wildfires. Utility safety regulators found that in each case Edison had violated multiple state safety regulations, including impeding their investigations.
Edison, which is contesting claims that its equipment also ignited this month’s deadly Eaton fire, said in a statement last year that transferring Thomas fire damage costs to customers would enable it to “continue doing necessary work to mitigate the effects of climate change.”
The company said it had “prudently operated its system, managing it at or above what is required by regulators.”
Dozens of people have written to the state commission, asking the panel to deny the request. Theresa Serventi of Hemet said as a retired person she was already struggling to pay her rising electric bill on a fixed income.
“They cannot and must not be allowed to punish their customers for their wrongdoing,” Serventi wrote after Edison filed its request to raise electric rates to cover the Thomas fire claims.
The Thomas fire killed two people and also helped cause the debris flows in Montecito that killed 23 more.
Fadia Khoury, Edison’s assistant general counsel, noted that under the settlement negotiated with the commission’s public advocates office the company would get only about 60% of the $2.4 billion it originally requested for the Thomas fire. About 40% — or about $1 billion — would be picked up by the company and its shareholders.
Low-income customers will see no increases to their bills for the recovery of costs from either fire, Khoury said.
The Wild Tree Foundation, an environmental group, also is calling on the commission to vote against the Thomas fire settlement agreement. The group says that documents from investigators at the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection, the Ventura County Fire Department and the commission’s safety and enforcement division show that Edison “failed to act reasonably and prudently.”
“This is not the first time the commission has bailed out utilities for catastrophic wildfires and it will likely not be the last,” said April Maurath Sommer, the foundation’s executive director.
If the commission approves the plan Thursday, Sommer said, Edison would recover most of what it paid to victims of the Thomas fire “by raising electricity rates on those very victims themselves.”
The Thomas fire swept through almost 282,000 acres in Ventura and Santa Barbara counties, destroying 1,063 structures.
Investigators said Edison’s equipment was the cause of two separate ignitions Dec. 4, 2017, near Santa Paula. The two fires then spread and eventually merged.
Cal Fire and Ventura County fire investigators said one ignition was caused by an electric wire falling and igniting dry brush. The other ignition happened, the investigators said, when two wires slapped together, releasing molten metal into the vegetation.
The commission’s safety and enforcement division later said the company had violated five rules and regulations, including failure to cooperate with investigators. The division said Edison had failed to provide all the photos, notes and texts taken by the Edison employees who were the first at the scene.
Khoury said Edison disagreed with investigators that the company was negligent in causing the Thomas fire. The company also disagrees that its equipment sparked one of the ignition sites, she said.
“We are operating a complicated business as safely as we can,” she said.
Terrie Prosper, a spokeswoman for the utilities commission, said that although the agency’s enforcement staff identified the violations, the five-member commission later did not find any violations related to the Thomas fire.
The Thomas and Woolsey fires occurred before the state Legislature created a wildfire insurance fund. That fund would help to cover some costs if investigators find that Edison’s equipment sparked the firestorm that started in Eaton Canyon on Jan. 7. At least 17 people have died.
The company says that its initial internal investigation did not find that its equipment started the fire, and that the investigation is continuing. Lawyers representing victims of the fire disagree. They point to videos of the fire starting below one of the company’s transmission towers built high in the canyon.
Edison’s application to transfer $5.4 billion it paid out to victims of the Woolsey fire to customers is still being reviewed by state officials.
The Woolsey fire started Nov. 8, 2018, on the site of the old Santa Susana test lab near Simi Valley. High winds sent it raging across almost 97,000 acres, destroying 1,643 structures and killing three people.
Investigators determined that a loose down guy wire attached to a steel pole contacted a jumper wire, creating an arc flash. The arc flash caused hot metal fragments to drop and ignite dried brush, the investigators said.
Prosper at the commission said that Edison had contested all 26 violations found by its safety and enforcement division after its investigation into the Woolsey fire.
Edison says that in recent years it has spent heavily on work to mitigate wildfires, including trimming trees and putting in wires with a coating that greatly reduces the risk of fire.
That wildfire mitigation work now makes up about 11% of the average bill for an Edison customer, according to the commission’s public advocates office.
The company says that work has reduced the risk of a catastrophic wildfire ignited by its equipment by 85% to 90% compared with what it was before 2018.
The number of ignitions involving its equipment have not fallen as much, according to data the company reported to the commission.
In 2017, there were 105 ignitions involving Edison’s equipment. That number rose to 173 ignitions in 2021. Last year, there were 90 ignitions — a 14% decline since 2017.
Khoury said the reduced risk of catastrophic wildfire should not be compared with reductions in the number of ignitions, which would include even those happening in rainy weather.
The commission’s meeting is scheduled for 11 a.m. Thursday. The five-member panel has put the decision on the consent agenda, which means it is expected to pass without discussion. The panel allows the public to speak at the start of the meeting.
People can also comment at thecommission’s websiteunder proceeding 23-08-013.

L.A. County says state housing laws stand in way of rebuilding. Advocates disagree,https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2025-01-29/l-a-county-says-state-housing-laws-stand-in-way-of-rebuilding-advocates-disagree,2025-01-29,"A request by L.A. County officials to temporarily waive state housing laws as residents rebuild in fire-ravaged swaths of unincorporated areas drew the ire of housing advocates, who accused the officials of skirting efforts at boosting affordable housing.
County Supervisors Kathryn Barger and Lindsey Horvath, who represent districts blackened by this month’s wildfires, put forward amotionTuesday with 41 steps they want department heads to take to speed up the recovery process.
That included an ask to Gov. Gavin Newsom to temporarily exempt the county from some of the state’s most significant housing laws intended to speed up the creation of affordable housing, including parts ofSenate Bill 330,aimed at preserving affordable housing, and theDensity Bonus Law,which encourages developers to build new units.
Amy Bodek, head of the county planning department, said she believed the state laws could end up hampering recovery, incentivizing density at the expense of homeowners looking to rebuild what they had.
“In order to provide the community the ability to return and not face immediate displacement, we understand the need to pause some of these policies,” she said at Tuesday’s Board of Supervisors meeting, adding that she wanted to ask for a five-year waiver for unincorporated areas, which include Altadena and some of the communities burned by the Palisades fire.
“We are not antihousing,” she said. “To say that we are antihousing is someone that’s not been paying attention.”
At the meeting, housing advocates contended that the county‘s waiver proposal would slash too many restrictions, bypassing laws aimed at solving the region’s affordable housing crisis.
“This is just totally going in the wrong direction,” said Nolan Gray, senior director of legislation and research forCalifornia YIMBY,noting that the laws have spurred the construction of thousands of affordable units across the state. “There’s so much in here that has nothing to do with helping people rebuild.”
Chris Elmendorf, a law professor at UC Davis who studiesCalifornia housing law, said the county was too broad in requesting a waiver in undefined “fire impacted communities.”
“If the goal is to get people back to their communities as fast as possible, shouldn’t the goal be to build as much housing in those communities as fast as possible?” he said.
Barger, who represents Altadena, said the accusation that the county was uninterested in ramping up housing “could not be further from the truth.”
Bodek said it was unclear whether the governor would agree to the county’s waiver request, but she hoped the letter would be a starting point for conversations with the state.
The remarks came as part of a larger discussion over how the county should prepare for an influx of new buildings in areas reduced to rubble. Bodek said the planning department, which is responsible for permitting in unincorporated L.A. County, is expecting as many as 8,000 permit applications from homeowners wanting to rebuild after the Eaton fire and 600 from the Palisades fire.
Without beefing up staffing, she said, “it is going to be breaking our department.”
Mark Pestrella, the head of the county public works department, said his agency was similarly preparing for a mammoth undertaking in repairing utilities in fire-scarred areas.
“A small public works department needs to be created in particular for the Altadena area if we are to meet the needs of the community to rebuild,” he told the supervisors Tuesday.
The repairs and rebuilding are likely to cost the county billions of dollars, much of which county officials hope will come from the federal government. On Tuesday, the White House said it would freeze trillions in federal grants and loans that don’t align with the Trump administration’s priorities. The order was quickly blocked by a federal judge.
“We are very concerned about that,” said Fesia Davenport, the county’s chief executive. “We do need to know what the exact impact will be on the county.”

(San José State University’s Moss Landing Marine Laboratories)
Days after one of the world’s largest lithium ion battery storage facilitiesburst into flamesin Monterey County, researchers found alarmingly high concentrations of heavy metals at a nearby estuary that is home to several endangered species.
Scientists at San José State University recorded a dramatic increase in nickel, manganese and cobalt — materials used in lithium ion batteries — in soil samples at the Elkhorn Slough Reserve after the recent fire at the nearby Moss Landing Power Plant.
The toxic metals threaten to upset the delicate ecosystem at the Elkhorn Slough, which is the state’s second-largest estuary and plays a key role in sequestering carbon emissions and protecting the coastline from sea level rise, said Ivano Aiello, chair of the university’s Moss Landing Marine Laboratories.
Aiello, who has monitored environmental conditions at the slough for more than a decade, said he was shocked by the results.
The concentration of nickel, manganese and cobalt measured on the surface of the soil is hundreds to thousands of times as much as the levels in the surface soil prior to the fire or compared with levels measured deeper in the soil.
“I was wondering whether there was anything associated with this fire that could have been impacted,” said Aiello. “I didn’t know I was going find such a high concentration of those metals.”
On Tuesday, Monterey County Supervisor Glenn Church called the findings “extremely disturbing” and said he was worried about what future data would reveal regarding theconsequences of the unprecedented blaze. The fire ignited Jan. 16, burned for five days and ultimately destroyed an estimated 80% of the batteries inside the building, which is on the coast about 18 miles north of the city of Monterey.
Assemblymember Dawn Addis (D-Morro Bay) said in a statement Monday that she was “deeply concerned” about the concentration of heavy metals in “one of our most cherished and fragile ecosystems.”
“These concentrations are directly linked to the battery energy storage fire,” she said.
California
When a massive fire erupted at one of the world’s largest lithium-ion battery storage facilities in Monterey County, it didn’t just send a toxic plume of smoke over nearby communities — it cast a shadow of doubt over the future of California’s clean energy industry.
The battery storage site is owned by Texas-based Vistra Energy. A spokesperson said Tuesday that the company was aware of San José State’s data and would work with local health agencies to determine next steps. Vistra is also completing its own investigation into the fire and environmental monitoring around the plant, the spokesperson said.
The Elkhorn Slough Reserve was closed to the public from Jan. 17 to Jan. 21 while it and residential areas near the power plant were under evacuation orders due to the fire. It is now open to visitors.
Initial air quality monitoring from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency determined that there wasno public health riskposed by levels of particulate matter and hydrogen fluoride gas released during the fire. Hydrogen fluoride is a highly toxic gas produced by lithium ion battery fires that can cause severe respiratory damage as well as skin and eye burns.
The EPA did not plan to conduct soil or water testing, which is instead being carried out by local and state health agencies.
The Monterey County Health Department said Monday it was grateful for the testing conducted by Aiello’s team and planned to present preliminary results from its own soil and water samples later this week.
The department said it was working with the California Department of Public Health, the California Environmental Protection Agency and state epidemiologists to “evaluate the research, assess any potential health concerns, and determine the appropriate steps moving forward.”
San José State’s soil samples suggest there could be long-term environmental and health effects from the toxic blaze, said Aiello.
His lab is now in “emergency mode” trying to collect data and understand how the heavy metals might affect the ecosystem. Scientists have collected soil samples from more than 100 locations within a two-mile radius of the plant since Jan. 22.
“There’s a layer of heavy metals now on the soil, and I don’t know what’s going to happen. Is it going to be washed away? Is it going to penetrate to the groundwater? Is it going to concentrate and bioaccumulate?” he said. “We need to learn that before we can actually understand the implications.”
The Elkhorn Slough is home to more than 700 species of plants, animals and marine life, including endangered and threatened species such as the southern sea otter, the Santa Cruz long-toed salamander and the California brown pelican.
Its marshlands store large amounts of carbon, helping to mitigate climate change. The estuary also helps prevent coastal erosion and absorb the effects of sea level rise.
California
A study from the U.S. Geological Survey found the ecosystems on California’s public lands are losing the carbon they’ve locked up from the atmosphere faster than any other state, driven in large part by wildfires.
Supervisor Church has said the fire raises the question of whether the plant should be located near an environmentally sensitive area. He and fellow board members passed a resolution last week asking that the battery storage facility remain offline until a thorough investigation could be completed and new safety measures implemented.
In the aftermath of the blaze, Assemblymember Addis introduced new legislation that would require that local government be given a say in the permitting process for battery or energy storage facilities, and establish a buffer to keep such sites a set distance away from schools, hospitals and natural habitats.
“True climate solutions must benefit — not harm — our communities and natural environment,” she said in a statement. “We have to continue to fight for the inclusion of community voice and proper siting of battery energy storage facilities.”
The American Clean Power Assn. has opposed her proposal,Assembly Bill 303, saying it puts overly onerous restrictions on the clean energy industry.
“The best way to promote safety across the state of California is the universal adoption and enforcement of the latest version of the national fire protection standard for battery energy storage,” ACP-California Executive Director Alex Jackson said in a statement. “This proposal misses the mark. Its sprawling restrictions would make it harder to keep the lights on in California.”

Your car didn’t escape the fire? Here’s how to get rid of it,https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2025-01-29/your-car-didnt-escape-the-fire-heres-how-to-get-rid-of-it,2025-01-29,"In the chaos of fleeing from the fast-moving flames of the Palisades and Eaton firestorms, many evacuees were forced to abandon their cars, somein the middle of the street,to escape the blaze.
There are a few options for disposing of your damaged or destroyed vehicles.
Fire survivors from both communities are currently not allowed toreturn to their fire-damaged properties to clean up or remove fire debris, including scorched cars, until a hazardous materials inspection is completed by the Environmental Protection Agency.
The inspection is done during the first phase of adebris removal programled  by the Los Angeles County Department of Public Works. In this first phase, which is free to residents, the EPA will go through burned areas to assess, remove and safely dispose of household hazardous materials including paints, cleaners, solvents, oils, batteries, herbicides and pesticides.
Once the EPA cleanup crews deem a property to be free of hazardous waste and materials, a completion sign is placed on the property. This means the property is ready for Phase 2.
The EPA will update itsonline mapso the public can track the status of the EPA’s work.
In the second phase of the program, owners of destroyed structures will be able to participate in a government-sponsored program to have their properties cleared of fire debris, including burned cars.
You don’t have to be. If you decide to opt into the second phase of the county’s debris removal program, the damaged vehicles will be removed free of charge.
Vehicles left behind on a burned property will be removed by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers as part of the second phase of the program, said Lisette Guzman, public information officer for the Department of Public Works.
“The vehicles will then be taken to a lot where the county will process [them] for recycling,” she said.
The process for removing fire-damaged or destroyed vehicles will be the same for residents of burned areas in Altadena and the Palisades communities.
California
Hazardous items in the fire zones can include batteries, ammunition, propane tanks, pesticides, and cleaning products that can become unsafe when exposed to heat and fire. Harmful chemicals can be present in the ash in charred neighborhoods, according to experts.
You can opt into the county’s second phase of the  program by submitting a “right of entry” form, which gives the government authority to manage debris removal from your property.
That entails:
To participate in the county program you must fill out and submit an “opt-in” form that can bedownloaded onlineor found at one of the Disaster Recovery Centers.
There are several options to submit the form:
You can also work with a licensed private company to dispose of your vehicle by going through your auto insurance provider, according to the California Department of Insurance.
If you want to go this route and not participate in the county removal program, you have to first opt out of the county program byfilling out and submitting an “opt out” form.
The form can be submitted by:
After submitting your “opt out” form, you need to apply for a cleanup permit from the county’sEPIC-LA online portalto handle debris removal from your property. This step cannot be done until after you receive EPA certification of the completion of the Phase 1 hazardous material cleanup on your property.
The county will then review your application along with your contractor’s work plan to ensure compliance with safety and environmental standards.
You will be responsible for any removal costs that exceed your insurance settlement amount for debris removal.
When it comes to removing a fire damaged vehicle, the cost will be covered if you have a comprehensive insurance coverage policy that covers the loss of the vehicle as well as the process of recovering it, said Mark Friedlander, spokesperson for the Insurance Information Institute.
That’s because the comprehensive portion of an auto insurance policy covers damage from wildfires and other natural disasters, including floods, windstorm damage and hail damage, Friedlander said.
Your insurance claim adjuster will walk you through the process.
California
More than 200 people attended a forum on recovering from the Pacific Palisades fire on Sunday, where they pressed officials on an array of issues.
Yes, the removal of fire-damaged electric and hybrid cars is the same as other vehicles if you opt into the second phase of the debris removal program.
The only difference is that during the first phase of the debris removal program, the EPA will remove the car batteries along with your home backup power supplies, items that are considered household hazardous materials.
Cleanup teams must de-energize and decommission the batteries for proper recycling and disposal.
If you had to abandon your car on the road, it’s likely that the damaged vehicle has already been removed.
In the Pacific Palisades community, the Los Angeles Police Department is responsible for the removal of fire-damaged cars, according to county officials.
In Altadena, the responsible agency is the Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department.
The California Department of Motor Vehicles’ Investigations Division is working to identify damaged vehicles, including those whose vehicle identification numbers are not identifiable because of fire damage, said Ronald Ongtoaboc, spokesperson for the DMV.
If you lost your driver’s license, registration, vehicle title or disabled placard in the Los Angeles-area fires, you can apply for replacements from the DMV and have the fees waived.
For example, you can request a replacement driver’s license or identification card by visiting alocal Disaster Recovery Center where DMV officials can help youreplace or reapply for the documents.
You can  seek the same assistance at your nearby DMV office. A list of DMV locations and contact information ishere;online appointments can bemade here.

Bill providing one year of mortgage relief for L.A. fire victims moving forward,https://www.latimes.com/business/story/2025-01-29/bill-providing-one-year-of-mortgage-relief-for-l-a-fire-victims-moving-forward,2025-01-29,"State legislation that would make it easier for victims of the Los Angeles County fires to receive one year of mortgage relief will move ahead, despite voluntary agreements Gov. Gavin Newsom reached with hundreds of lenders.
Assembly Bill 238would allow borrowers to put a stop to their mortgage payments for up to 180 days with no fees, penalties or interest, simply by attesting — without documentation — that the fires caused a financial hardship. The relief could be extended another 180 days at the property owner’s request.
The bill also would prohibit a mortgage servicer from initiating a foreclosure, and moving for or executing a foreclosure judgment or sale.
Business
Gov. Gavin Newsom announced that 270 state-chartered banks, credit unions, and others will provide mortgage relief for property owners affected by the Los Angeles wildfires.
“This should be the industry standard across the board and I look forward to continuing to work with stakeholders to make this a reality for all those who were impacted by the wildfires,” said Assemblymember andco-sponsor John Harabedian, (D-Pasadena), whose district includes hard-hit Altadena.
The bill, co-sponsored byAssemblymember Jacqui Irwin(D-Thousand Oaks), whose district includes Pacific Palisades, was introduced prior to Newsom’s agreements with several big banks and hundreds of state-chartered lenders to provide mortgage relief — but not on as generous terms.
Those agreements provided for streamlined processes toseek 90-days of relieffrom payments, without accruing late fees or being dinged by credit bureaus, and protections from new foreclosure of eviction actions for at least 60 days. It is being offered to borrowers whose properties were damaged or destroyed.
Federally chartered Wells Fargo, Bank of America, JP Morgan, Citibank and U.S. Bank reached an agreement with Newsom to provide the voluntary relief on Jan. 18, following by270 state-chartered banks last week.
Business
Some policyholders who suffered total losses in L.A. fires are not getting claims advances for their living expenses and loss of contents as required, Insurance Commissioner Ricardo Lara alleged Thursday.
Among the state banks participating in the program are Banc of California, Hanmi Bank and PennyMac Loan Services.
City National Bank, a subsidiary of Royal Bank of Canada and the largest bank headquartered in the county, added its name this week to the roster of lenders  providing mortgage relief.
The Assembly bill would typically be referred to a committee for a hearing in the spring, but Harabedian’s office said the lawmaker will be seeking other options to expedite the legislation.
The bill has nine principal co-authors, nearly all representing districts including Los Angeles County.

As the cleanup phase of recovery begins after the devastating fires in L.A. County, displaced residents grapple with new uncertainty surrounding the cost and timeline for rebuilding.

"Meryl Streep ‘cut a car-sized hole in the fence,’ fled fire through a neighbor’s yard, nephew says",https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/story/2025-01-28/meryl-streep-los-angeles-fires-car-sized-hole-fence,2025-01-29,"Meryl Streep took matters into her own hands — literally — as wildfires rampaged across Los Angeles County earlier this month.
According to nephew Abe Streep, the Oscar-winning actor sprang into action after a fallen tree blocked her driveway as she tried to evacuate her home the day after wind-stokedfiresbroke out across the region. In his harrowing account of the historic fires in Altadena, Pacific Palisades and Hollywood that was published Tuesday inNew York Magazine, Streep wrote that his aunt, 75, borrowed a neighbor’s wire cutters and “cut a car-size hole in the fence” they shared.
The “Devil Wears Prada” star, “determined to make it out,” then drove through her neighbor’s yard to escape, her nephew recalled.
Entertainment & Arts
Paris Hilton, Mandy Moore, Jeff Bridges, Mel Gibson and Britney Spears are among the many L.A. County residents affected by the destruction of historic fires.
Meryl Streep was one of a handful of area residents whose experiences with the fires — which have claimed 29 lives and destroyed more than 15,000 structures — were told in the New York story. The younger Streep also spoke to a longtime West Altadena resident, a Palisades native and schoolteacher, actor Haley Joel Osment and his aunt’s “Only Murders in the Building” co-star Martin Short, among others.
Short, who knew “right away” in the early years of his career that he would live in Pacific Palisades and bought there in 1984, told Abe Streep he “will definitely stay in my home,” despite one of his sons losing a house. “The Sixth Sense” and “Blink Twice” star Osment said he and his parents lost their homes in the Eaton fire.
In one of the most destructive firestorms to hit Los Angeles County in recent memory, at least 130,000 Angelenos fled for safety — with celebrities among thosereeling from the devastation.
California
The recent storm brought some much needed moisture to Southern California without the dangerous mudslides some feared. But did it help reduce the fire danger?
As of Tuesday morning, the Palisades, Eaton and Hughes fires in L.A. County were 95%, 99% and 98% contained, respectively, according to the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection. Containment of the Border 2 fire in San Diego County was listed at 74%. No homes burned inHollywood’s Sunset fire, which was fully contained on Jan. 9.
The rainstorm in recent daysbrought much-needed moistureto Southern California and welcome relief to fire-weary Angelenos. Ryan Kittell, a National Weather Service meteorologist in Oxnard, said Tuesday that while the amount of rainfall wasn’t enough to prevent fire season from extending into February, “This was a largely beneficial rain.
“I think we dodged a bullet,” he said. “It helped with the firefights and definitely gives us a break from fire weather.”

"With shocking secret footage, prison doc ‘The Alabama Solution’ should outrage the nation",https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/movies/story/2025-01-28/sundance-the-alabama-solution-andrew-jarecki-charlotte-kaufman,2025-01-28,"PARK CITY, Utah —I’ve been recommending “The Alabama Solution” to everyone I meet since I landed atthe Sundance Film Festivallast week — but only under my breath.
That’s because Andrew Jarecki and Charlotte Kaufman’s bombshell investigation of the Alabama prison system, which premiered here Tuesday, was screened in advance for press under strict embargo. Understandable, once you realize that the film’s key sources are inmates themselves. Much of “The Alabama Solution,” which reports on inhumane living conditions, forced labor and widespread violence against the state’s incarcerated population, is comprised largely of footage captured by inmates using contraband cellphones, offering one of the most shocking, visceral depictions of our carceral state ever put to film.
The result, in which brave inmate activists Melvin Ray and Robert Earl Council leak vital information, and the filmmakers chase down leads with shoe-leather doggedness, should outrage the nation. And encourage us to reexamine our own backyards: As co-producer Alex Duran reminded me, California votersrecently rejected a ballot measurethat would have banned forced prison labor, andincarcerated firefighters were instrumentalto the battle against the recent L.A. wildfires.
Jarecki and Kaufman sat down with me at theL.A. Times Studios at Sundanceto discuss the risks their sources face with the film’s release, what they’d like to ask Alabama Gov. Kay Ivey and more. The following has been edited and condensed.
Before we talk about the genesis of the film, I wanted to start with your interest in the subject matter of the film: mass incarceration, the criminal justice system, prison conditions. What was your level of interest in that topic before “The Alabama Solution”?
Andrew Jarecki:I remember going to see Jesse Friedman at Dannemora Correctional Facility when I was making “Capturing the Friedmans,” and the experience of going into a maximum-security facility in upstate New York was such a surprise to me — just the level of lockdown, the level of closure to the outside world and certainly to journalists. So it always intrigued me. And then I’d made films about various aspects of the justice system. So when I went down to Alabama in 2019, just to sort of go to Montgomery and see what I would see, I met this prison chaplain and I realized that they went into the prisons and did barbecues and revival meetings. I thought. “Maybe there’s an opportunity to go there and learn something.” And I don’t think I thought about it as a film up front. I just was curious. But then when it became clear that there was a possibility for us to film, Charlotte and I got together and and went down there and we had this really extraordinary chance to go into a place that is normally absolutely closed to the media and to the public.
Charlotte, I wonder if you could talk about the story of that day at the barbecue. I’m curious, did you have a kind of vision of what you thought you were doing before you arrived that day? Obviously, once the prisoners start coming up to you and and saying, “There’s a story here that they’re not showing you,” that changed it, but did you have a different vision going in?
Charlotte Kaufman:I think we went in with open minds. You rarely get the opportunity to go into a prison facility in Alabama, and I think we saw this  as a great opportunity to be able to speak with some of the men, to just observe what we could around the facility, to learn what we could. But very quickly it became clear that there were only certain conversations that we were allowed to have and that we weren’t allowed to speak to the men alone. And I think that lack of access sort of compelled us to keep investigating.
After the first scene in the film, there’s a title card that explains that after your visit, you started getting outreach from inmates within the prison on contraband cellphones.And the footage from those calls that they’re sending you is at the core of the film, and it’s part of what makes it so shocking and outrageous. Take me back to the first outreach that you got. What was your reaction?
Jarecki:I mean, we were surprised when we went in there at the proliferation of cellphones. The fact that Alabama’s prisons are so extraordinarily understaffed and under-resourced means that the prisons are often operating with [a] skeleton crew of people. So you could have a 1,400-bed facility and that normally would be staffed with a few hundred officers. And maybe on a weekend there are 20 officers there. So that indicates that there’s a very low level of understanding even by correctional officers. There are large areas of the prison that they don’t spend any time in. So the ability to speak to these men on these cellphones, which are, in my view, largely brought in by the officers — there’s a big trade in cellphones — that was just a surprise to us. As much as I think it has been people seeing the film and saying, how is that even possible that they have these phones?
One of the things that watching it like really disturbed, upset me were just what they would show you about what the living conditions were like. Flooded floors, overflowing toilets, rats everywhere. Were you that shocked? Was that your response when you started seeing those images coming from your sources on the inside?
Kaufman:The Department of Justice had put out a very in-depth report about their own investigation into Alabama’s prison system. But it’s a very different experience reading the facts and reading the findings, versus actually seeing it. There is something that makes you really understand what it’s like to live in that environment when you can actually see it. And I think that’s why prisons are so secret. That’s why we’re not allowed to see in. And we can only read papers about what’s actually happening. Because when you do see it, it becomes a lot less tolerable.0Over the course of this six-year process, you formed relationships with your main sources inside the facilities. Now, with the film coming out — and as the film explores — they are at risk of reprisal from correctional officers and higher up. What were your ethical concerns about revealing their specific identities, and what were your conversations like with them about the risks and their ultimate willingness to undertake those risks?
Jarecki:We thought a lot about that issue, because obviously the more you get to know people that are in that situation, the more you recognize their vulnerability and the more you feel connected to them. There’s no avoiding that. And it was kind of a beautiful thing about the film that you get to see the humanity in these people who are often seen by society through a very different lens. So we always thought about it and spoke extensively to them about it. These are men who had been working on their own for many years to get the word out on the crisis in this prison system. So when we first started talking, they were very clear —  we were part of their agenda, in a way. It was very important for them to do this work. And so we were kind of there to ride along. So  it was a symbiotic process. They’re very well known to the authorities inside and they have been retaliated against in the past. So we’re concerned. We continue to be concerned about it. And there’s been an organization that’s created a defense committee to help them if that does come to pass.
I wanted to talk a little bit about your qualitative experiences as filmmakers with this unique process where your sources are separated from you by the divide of the prison walls, but you’re talking to them regularly. This struck me during the narrative about the prison strike and then the breaking of the strike: You’re both at one level getting more information than the general public is getting through the news media, but you’re also not close enough to it to really feel like there’s any kind of control that you can exert. What is that like for you emotionally or creatively as filmmakers?
Kaufman:It’s a very intense experience to follow along and watch this incredibly inspiring and moving movement of the strike but then also watch how the state responds. It’s a privilege to be able to have these extended conversations with all of our participants. But at the same time, that’s why the film is so urgent, because they’re at risk and they’re doing their activism regardless of this film. And that’s also what puts them at risk. They’ve been retaliated against for their activism for like two decades now.
Jarecki:These are men who have been the victims of violence in the system and often violence by people who are allegedly supposed to look out for their safety. And so the ability to have that kind of up-close contact with them and recognize the bravery that they’re showing in being able to share this, it’s such a high level of trust that had to be established for them to allow us to sort of ride along and see this incredibly unique kind of protest. But it’s really important to recognize, despite the violence that they have been subjected to, all of their work is nonviolent. They’re extremely thoughtful about the importance of nonviolent action. And the fact that the state, which has all the machinery of government and all kinds of special military equipment, can’t find a way to respond to them except through violence is really an example of how the system is pretty topsy-turvy.
The title of the film comes from an oft-used phrase by Alabama Gov. Kay Ivey, who is an interviewed in the film. If you got the chance to get her on the record on camera, what would you ask her?
Jarecki:The first question I would ask her is whether she visits the prisons. And I’m quite sure that she would say, “Well, on one occasion...,” something like that. We probably would both be eager to have that conversation. But my first question would be to try to really understand how insulated she must be from what’s happening to her own citizens of her own state, for her to just keep proposing solutions that are not solutions.
Kaufman:I would ask her to give us access. We were able to make this film because we had some really brave individuals who took great risks to have conversations with us, to share material with us. But I would ask her, “What would it take for you to actually allow transparency and for the media to be able to come in and talk to the men freely and to bring cameras in freely?”
Jarecki:There’s a fact that we’ve sort of been talking about how to convey. It’s sort of an extraordinary statistic that I’m pretty sure that governor doesn’t know. Of many statistics I think the governor’s not familiar with. But when you learn about the work programs, essentially forced labor that happens inside the system, of the 20,000 men who are in that system, many of them are caused to work inside the prisons, outside the prisons, on road crews around the state and even at McDonald’s and many other companies. The state is putting them to work and the corrections department is gathering the money for that work and the men are getting a tiny sliver of that. What’s extraordinary is that the people who are allowed to work and who are considered safe enough to be in the community interacting — you see some of them in the film walking around the state fair, walking around the governor’s mansion — those people are less likely, statistically, to be paroled than the people who are at the next highest level of concern for safety. People who are considered safer are less likely to be let out, arguably because they are more valuable as people who can be put to work. ... I don’t think anybody’s doing that math because I don’t think it’s of great concern to them, partly because they too are isolated from being able to see what’s happening in their own system.

California’s federal lands are hemorrhaging carbon dioxide. Wildfires are largely to blame,https://www.latimes.com/environment/story/2025-01-28/californias-federal-lands-are-hemorrhaging-carbon,2025-01-28,"The ecosystems on the American Southwest’s federal lands are hemorrhaging carbon dioxide into the atmosphere faster than any other region in the U.S., according toa recent study from the U.S. Geological Survey.
While federal land ecosystems in most states are sequestering carbon dioxide on average, California’s lost six times more than any other state during the 17-year period from 2005 to 2021 that the study analyzed.
“In California, it’s primarily a story of fire,” saidBenjamin Sleeter, a research geographer with the USGS who led the ecosystem analysis in the new study.
While scientists typically expect the movement of carbon in and out of ecosystems to cancel out in the long run, human intervention and climate change have destabilized the delicate balance. It’s made the daunting task of modeling carbon flowing between ecosystems and the atmosphere, which has challenged scientists for decades, even harder.
“On long-term timescales, the terrestrial biosphere would be carbon neutral because there would only be so much carbon to go around,” saidAnna Michalak, a carbon cycle researcher with Carnegie Science, a nonprofit research institute. But it’s not so simple, she said, because “we’re digging up carbon that hasn’t been in circulation for millions of years, and we’re injecting that carbon into the atmosphere.”
Generally, the rich networks of plant life on Earth — from California’s coastal scrublands and marshes to the Amazon rainforest to the  Sahara Desert — sequester carbon away from the atmosphere in their limbs, trunks and leaves. They exchange this carbon with the atmosphere through many pathways, including sucking it up to grow and releasing it when they decay or burn in a wildfire.
Many lands act as carbon sinks, and in many cases — including in most states in the eastern United States — climate change can increase how much ecosystems absorb, since there’s more carbon in the air for plants to suck up.
“That carbon is not only warming the planet but also being used as additional food for [plants],” said Michalak. It “literally means that things are growing faster than they are dying.”
But what the ecosystems can taketh, they can giveth back. Humans continue to cut down plants and trees to develop residential communities and industrial sites. Research shows humans areigniting large wildfires more frequentlyand climate change is exacerbating such fires in the Southwest, including by making explosive fire growth about25% more frequentin California.
California’s carbon picture varies widely from year to year. Drought can slow plant growth. Logging and development projects are at the whim of market pressures and politics. Fire seasons are erratic.
In five of the 17 years the USGS team analyzed, California’s federal lands acted as a carbon sink — not a source. For example, in 2019, the state experiencedwell over two times its average precipitationin many regions, boosting plant growth and, despite the devastatingKincade fire, had arelatively mild fire season.
But just a year later, the state’s federal lands released more carbon than any other year in the study period due to a record-setting fire season thatburned over4 million acresand, according to the USGS study, emitted over 90 million tons of carbon dioxide on federal land alone.
Scientists say this “climate whiplash” — from intense rainy years with fast plant growth followed by grueling dry years that wither the vegetation and make it more flammable — is fueling the state’s wildfire problem. Climate change is making the whiplash even more extreme.
On average, each acre of California’s federal lands lost roughly three-quarters of a ton of carbon dioxide every year from 2005 to 2021, the USGS study found.
The land’s biological processes are generally balanced: Plant growth and decay result in roughly 4 tons of carbon dioxide absorbed per acre every year, while microorganisms eating plant matter in the soil release 4 tons. However, fire releases an extra half ton, while logging and development projects remove another fifth of a ton. (Though not all of that ends up in the atmosphere, Sleeter said —  timber, for example, is used in construction and so retains its carbon.)
Some scientists who have compared simulations to the real-world aftermath of wildfires argue that models like those used in the USGS study tend tooverestimate how many trees are burned in blazes, and consequently how much carbon they release. Other scientists have pointed out that the USGS model seems tounderestimate the carbon lost due to logging and thinning projects.
It’s symptomatic of significant uncertainties in carbon modeling that have troubled scientists for decades. Across the field, “the uncertainty in these carbon sinks … A, is uncomfortably large and B, has not really been shrinking over time,” said Michalak.
In a monumental 2018assessment of the state of carbon modeling for North America, scientists from across the continent assessed top models in the field. Using a similar approach to the USGS team, their estimate for the net amount of carbon the continent absorbed every year was still a large range, between 0.2 billion and 1.2 billion tons.
Part of the problem is that, unlike weather forecasters who can wait a day to check their predictions, carbon cycle researchers have little ability to directly measure carbon flow to test their models, Michalak said.
As the USGS team continues to refine its models and analysis — including extending the work to all land, not just land owned by the federal government — it hopes the results can help inform leaders and policymakers.
In afollow-up study based on the data, Sleeter and his colleagues found land conservation, restoration and management could flip California from a carbon source to a carbon sink by midcentury, if pursued aggressively.

"A new photo project with work from Sofia Coppola, Jack Antonoff and more raises money for wildfire victims.",https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/music/story/2025-02-28/a-new-photo-project-with-work-from-sofia-coppola-jack-antonoff-and-more-raises-money-for-wildfire-victims,2025-02-28,"The deer look pensive, almost like they know what’s coming.
In “Family,” a black-and-white photograph from director Spike Jonze, two of the  animals look straight into the camera while a third looks up at one of them,  framed on a hillside overlooking a palm tree and downtown skyscrapers. Nature and urbanity uncomfortably thrust together — part of the allure and danger of Los Angeles.
After the devastating wildfires in January, such scenes are on a lot of Angelenos’ minds. But so is vibrant escapism, after the barrage of destruction we all witnessed.California Picture Project, a new all-star, fine-art photo series and fundraiser from a group of L.A. music executives and creative directors, makes room for all of it.
“When it initially happened, I think we were all shell-shocked,” said Niki Roberton, the senior vice president of creative for RCA Records. “It displaced friends, parents at our daughter’s school had lost their homes. We were desperate to find a way to volunteer. But we had Spike Jonze and Sofia Coppola and Dave Free, these incredible creatives that were keen to join us. This was the most immediate way for our skill sets to be able to help.”
Music
Mikael Wood and August Brown were at Inglewood’s Intuit Dome and Kia Forum for the FireAid benefit concerts starring Billie Eilish, Lady Gaga, Green Day and Stevie Wonder, among many others.
The series of prints — all up for purchase at $150 from Feb. 28 to March 9 — collects dozen of donated images from dozens of fine-art photographers (Richard Kern, Petra Collins) and musicians (Kim Gordon, Jack Antonoff).
Some of the images are genuinely haunting documents of the disaster itself. Martine Syms’ “Luctor et Emergo” shows a burned-out fireplace from a charred home, spray-painted with “Mama Didn’t Raise No Quitters,” while Maddy Rotman’s “Emily Outside the Altadena House” portrays a pregnancy in a neighborhood now synonymous with destruction.
But a lot of the shots are pure abstractions or low-stakes celebrity snapshots. For mid-aughts nostalgists, you can take home a Cobrasnake portrait of Paris Hilton or Theo Liu’s snap of Kylie Jenner being eaten by a huge bug.
Some are easygoing portraits of André 3000 playing flute for awed school kids or fashion icon Rick Owens lounging in a giant unmade bed; there’s Danny Trejo eating grapes in a Nadia Lee Cohen frame or Moses Sumney in a rich black-and-white self portrait. Others draw from A-list creative directors like Stillz (known for working with Bad Bunny) or designer Wales Bonner.
Music
In a cruel coincidence, the Palisades and Eaton fires wiped out two neighborhoods with unique significance in L.A.’s music industry.
The fires will be an enormous subject for art in the years to come, as they claimed two neighborhoods with significant ties to the music and creative industries. Famed recording studios and working-class artists’ homes burned in Pacific Palisades and Altadena. As brutal as the fires were, they did prompt a major effort from within the music industry to help rebuild lives, including the massive FireAid benefit concert and a Grammys focused on recovery.
“It was such a weird, crazy, scary way to start the year.” said Joe Mortimer, a creative executive at Capitol Records. “Especially in a city that can feel very disconnected, I think suddenly people felt very connected. It kind of went from this fear and uncertainty to optimism around the community, and then optimism of what can we do to help and leverage with our experience in what we do.”
The point of California Picture Project was not so much to document the destruction but  to raise a ton of money to donate to the California Community Foundation Wildfire Recovery Fund while reflecting the varied, global vantage points of artists with ties to L.A. They’re batting around plans to turn the project into a book, but for now, a few might even be candidates to hang on a wall. Oliver Hadlee Pearch’s “Lyndsey Wixson, LA,” shows a beaming woman sitting in a car, bursting to the brim with flowers.
“Ultimately, the goal of this is to raise as much money as possible, but within the context of everything that’s been going on here,” said Cameron Parkins, an artist manager with All Our Dreams. “It’s a fine line to walk, but the photographers did something really amazing within that.”

Corona-area dump burdened with underground fire sought to accept debris from L.A. infernos,https://www.latimes.com/environment/story/2025-02-28/southern-california-landfill-seeks-to-accept-fire-debris-amid,2025-02-28,"The Eaton and Palisades fires had barely broken out when Waste Management offered to accept the inevitable disaster debris at its El Sobrante Landfill near Corona.
But even as the company applied Jan. 8 for an emergency waiver to accept the wildfire rubble,  landfill staffers had been struggling for months to control a fiery situation of their own.
In July, El Sobrante managers informed the South Coast Air Quality Management District that a chemical reaction brewing inside the landfill was causing broiling temperatures and producing toxic sulfur pollution, according to air district records.
Waste Management sought approval to increase its tonnage capacity to take in wildfire debris anyway, which Riverside County officials granted the next day.
Riverside County officials are now requesting help from state officials for technical assistance with the situation. They acknowledge that they were notified by environmental regulators about the elevated temperatures, but declined to address whether granting the waiver was appropriate.
So far, no fire debris has been taken to the landfill, according to the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, the federal agency overseeing the debris cleanup. But, as of Thursday morning, it had remained on a list ofsites that were eligibleto accept this material.
Since The Times inquired about the chemical reaction at El Sobrante, state environmental regulators say they have ruled out allowing fire debris to be taken there.
“Debris from this year’s fires has not been sent to the El Sobrante landfill nor is the site under consideration for future use for this purpose,” said Nefretiri Cooley, a spokesperson for the California Environmental Protection Agency. “We are currently investigating this incident and will provide additional details as they are available.”
Waste Management executives say the chemical reaction has not interfered with daily operations at the 1,322-acre landfill. The affected area, they say, is about 3,000 feet from the section of the landfill where they had planned to dump disaster debris.
Environmental advocates, however, were irked that the landfill had even sought permission.
“I’m shocked and appalled that El Sobrante would take ash when it knows that its landfill is on fire,” said Jane Williams, executive director of California Communities Against Toxics. “You greatly increase the public health danger to the communities surrounding when landfills are being operated like this. An out-of-control landfill can emit more [toxic] benzene than an oil refinery.”
The situation at El Sobrante Landfill underscores the checkered compliance history at many Southern California landfills that are poised to receive an estimated 4.5 million tons of potentially hazardous ash, rubble and soil from the federal cleanup efforts. With such problems as excessive air pollution and insufficient inspections, state and local environmental regulators have handed down dozens of violations to these waste disposal facilities in the last year alone.
El Sobrante is the second landfill in Southern California in recent years to experience this type of scorching-hot chemical reaction — commonly called an underground landfill fire. Since 2022, operators of the since-closed Chiquita Canyon Landfill in Castaic struggled tocontain noxious fumes and contaminated runoffcaused by an underground garbage fire.
These underground dump fires cannot be easily extinguished and often take years to peter out. Although a cause has not been identified, these incidents have called into question the environmental oversight of California’s landfills.
The California Department of Resources Recycling and Recovery, the state agency that regulates landfills, declined to provide a comment.
In July, El Sobrante staff members told the local air district that the landfill had experienced a rise in highly flammable hydrogen gas and lung-aggravating dimethyl sulfide emissions — both telltale signs of abnormal temperatures inside the landfill.
Waste Management executives said in August that the pollution was emanating from a  two-acre “area of concern” where landfill staff had observed temperatures climbing above 200 degrees, according to Waste Management executives. Staff members also reported cracks on the landfill’s surface, with vapors and liquid waste seeping out. Since then, landfill workers began extracting liquid waste from the reaction area to alleviate the heat and pressure, transporting it to a waste treatment facility, according to air district records.
“South Coast AQMD continues to conduct unannounced on-site inspections at the landfill and responds to all public complaints,” said Nahal Mogharabi, a spokesperson for the air district. “This is an ongoing investigation.”
The conditions at El Sobrante Landfill mirrorissues at Chiquita Canyon Landfill, where residents called in thousands of odor complaints to the local air district.
Air district inspectors found white smoke venting from cracks on the landfill’s surface and liquid waste bursting onto the surface in a geyser-like fashion. The  Environmental Protection Agency said the reactionposed an “imminent” dangerto public health and the environment, citing the toxic chemicals released. L.A. County officials eventually helped organize a temporary relocation program for residents who wanted to escape the stench and toxic fumes.
Waste Connections, the owner of Chiquita Canyon,closed the landfillin December  and  is  focusing on managing the reaction area.
Federal and state environmental regulators suspected the Chiquita Canyon reaction was caused by oxygen intrusion.
Similar to oil drill sites, landfills have an extensive network of underground wells that are used to extract gases produced as buried waste decomposes. But if this system fails or overdraws these gases, these wells can introduce oxygen into the waste, speeding up waste decomposition and producing heat.
In addition to the air pollution, the extreme heat has the potential to damage the protective liner underneath the landfill that prevents liquid waste from seeping into the groundwater beneath and migrating to neighboring areas.
Recently,residents have protestedoutside some Southern California landfills to oppose the decision to dispose of fire debris at local landfills, which typically handle only garbage and construction debris. They have expressed concerns about these landfills’ ability to properly dispose of potentiallyhazardous wildfire ash and rubble— emphasizing long-standing issues with handling municipal solid waste.
For the record:
2:36 p.m. Feb. 28, 2025A previous version of the article stated that CalRecycle inspectors identified several violations at El Sobrante Landfill. Riverside County inspectors, who work in partnership with CalRecycle, found those violations.
In the last year, El Sobrante Landfill has been cited several times for excessive air pollution by the local air district. In that time, Riverside County inspectors also identified violations for elevated levels of flammable methane, improper signage and failure to conduct sufficient truck inspections to ensure hazardous wastes aren’t disposed at the site.

Former L.A. Fire Chief Kristin Crowley appeals her dismissal by Mayor Karen Bass,https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2025-02-27/former-lafd-chief-kristin-crowley-appeals-her-dismissal,2025-02-28,"Former Los Angeles Fire Chief Kristin Crowley took the extraordinary step Thursday of appealing Mayor Karen Bass’ decision to dismiss her over her handling of the catastrophic wildfire that destroyed much of Pacific Palisades.
The appeal, which would require the approval of 10 of 15 City Council members, is unlikely to succeed. But it will almost certainly cause further public turmoil for Bass, who has struggled to regain her political footing since the Palisades fire erupted Jan. 7.
The move comes less than a weekafter Bass ousted Crowley,criticizing the then-chief for not fully pre-deploying engines amid dire wind forecasts and for allegedly refusing to participate in an after-action report on the fire.
In an email to members of the City Council declaring her intent to appeal, Crowley did not provide any arguments to support her position, simply citing the section of the City Charter that allows her to seek reinstatement.
Bass spokesperson Zach Seidl said Thursday that Crowley “has the right to appeal her dismissal.”
City Council President Marqueece Harris-Dawson, a stalwart ally of the mayor’s, initially attempted to fast-track the process — a move that would help minimize the political disruption for Bass.
Hours after receiving Crowley’s letter, Harris-Dawson scheduled a special council meeting to decide Crowley’s fate at 5 p.m. on Friday in Van Nuys, which would have given the public only 24 hours notice — and also coincided with the start of the weekend.
Council meetings are normally held at 10 a.m. three days a week at City Hall in downtown L.A.
Harris-Dawson’s scheduling decision was quickly denounced as “outrageous” by United Firefighters of Los Angeles City Local 112, which represents city firefighters and is a strong supporter of Crowley. The union argued that the council was trying to “bury this issue when nobody is watching and holding them accountable.”
Councilmember Monica Rodriguez, who has been pushing for Crowley’s reinstatement, also spoke out, saying Harris-Dawson scheduled the meeting for a day he knew she had an excused absence. Harris-Dawson signed off on that absence months ago, she said.
“He wants to shut us down,” Rodriguez said. “He wants to shut down public participation and transparency.”
Harris-Dawson later tapped the brakes, telling The Times just after 8 p.m. that he had rescheduled the appeal vote for Tuesday.
California
Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass fired LAFD Chief Kristin Crowley on Friday.
“While it is in the best interest of the City to hear this matter expeditiously, it is important to allow the appellant, interested parties, and Councilmembers to be present and prepared for the meeting,” he said in a statement.
Regardless of the timing, Crowley will face an uphill climb to get the 10 votes needed to regain her job. Four council members, including Harris-Dawson, stood behind Bass at a news conference last Friday as she announced her decision to remove Crowley.
In addition to those four, Councilmember Bob Blumenfield said he believes the mayor has “the right to hire and fire whom she wishes.”
“She needs to have the full confidence of her general managers and her chiefs. If she has lost that confidence, she has every right to change out the head of a department” or the fire chief, he said in an interview earlier this week.
Blumenfield said he was also troubled by Crowley’s decision to appear on multiple news shows on Jan. 10 to complain that herdepartment was underfunded, at a time when the Palisades fire was still burning out of control.
California
Employee raises and other expenses are expanding the Los Angeles Fire Department’s budget. At the same time, the agency has had to scale back operations in recent months.
Councilmember Traci Park, an outspoken Crowley supporter whose district includes the Pacific Palisades burn area, said earlier this week that she could not predict how she would vote if Crowley were to appeal, saying she had not seen all of the evidence.
“I was not there when the mayor had whatever conversations that led to this decision,” she said. “I don’t know what information or evidence may come to light.”
Fernando Guerra, a political science professor and director of theCenter for the Study of L.A.at Loyola Marymount University, said that council members will face competing pressures. On one hand, the politically powerful firefighters union, which regularly donates to council members, is backing Crowley and has major clout at City Hall. But crossing the mayor so emphatically could also have repercussions for their political careers — and their ability to advance their own legislative agendas.
Bass, too, could be damaged by the public airing of her dispute with her former fire chief.
“There is nothing good about this being litigated in public for Mayor Bass,” Guerra said. “However, what will soften and mitigate that is the fact that the [former] fire chief will probably lose the appeal.”
TheCity Chartergives the mayor the power to remove most department heads, including the fire chief, without council approval. The charter also gives Crowley the right to appeal the decision to the council, with a two-thirds vote required to reinstate her.
The City Council has 10 “meeting days,” or days when the council is scheduled to meet, to take up Crowley’s filing, per the charter.
Before Bass dismissed Crowley last week, the mayor and her team told reporters that the chief hadn’t reached out to warn Bass about the potential severity of the winds before the mayorleft for Ghana on Jan. 4.
In announcing Crowley’s removal, Bass questioned her deployment decisions ahead of the fire and blamed her for sending home firefighters who could have stayed on for a second shift.
The mayor also alleged that Crowley had refused to participate in an after-action report on the fires after being asked to do so by Fire Commission President Genethia Hudley Hayes, a Bass appointee.
A Times investigation foundthat LAFD officials chose not to order roughly 1,000 firefighters to remain on duty for a second shift as the winds were building. Fire officials also declined to putall available engines in the fieldahead of the windstorm.
California
Fire officials made the critical decision to forgo calling in scores of extra firefighters and equipment in the hours before the fire, according to internal documents reviewed by The Times.
The department only started calling up more firefighters and deploying additional engines after the Palisades blaze was burning out of control. By comparison, a similar wind forecast in 2011 prompted amuch more robust responsefrom the department, according to former fire chiefs.
Although Crowley has defended her pre-deployment decisions, she has not yet addressed the allegation that she declined to do the after-action report. In a statement last week, she said she based her “actions and decisions on taking care of our firefighters so that they could take care of our communities.”
Bass’ decision to remove Crowley has been sharply criticized by the firefighters union in recent days.
Union President Freddy Escobar said the mayor should have waited for the results of an outside state review that’s already underway. Escobar praised Crowley for speaking out about the size of the Fire Department’s budget — and the need for greater resources.
“She’s being terminated for telling the truth,” he said last week.

‘Free parking courtesy of Luka:’ Fans — and a purple Regera — pull up to see new Laker Doncic face Mavs,https://www.latimes.com/sports/story/2025-02-27/luka-doncic-free-parking-jordan-brand-lakers-mavericks,2025-02-27,"When the Lakers acquiredLuka Doncicfrom the Dallas Mavericks this month, fans in Los Angeles knew they were gettinga phenomenal young playerwho is a five-time All-Star selection, led the league in scoring last season andtook his team to the NBA Finalsin June.
One thing those fans might not have been expecting?Free parking next to Crypto.com Arenaon game night.
But that’s what they got Tuesday. Doncic and his shoe sponsor,Jordan Brand, teamed up to buy out the lot at the corner of South Figueroa  and West 11th streets — just a walk across the street from the Lakers’ arena — to provide complimentary parking for fans on hand to seeDoncic’s first game against the Mavericks.
“Free parking courtesy of Luka,” read a sign at 1046 S. Figueroa St. that also featured Jordan Brand’s Jumpman logo.
Sports
There has been a lot of talk about Luka Doncic’s beer-drinking and hookah-smoking past with the Mavericks, but the soon-to-be 26-year-old has played well with the Lakers.
A Jordan Brand representative said Doncic and the company paid for 140 parking spotsin celebration ofL.A.’s newest superstar.
Earlier in the day, Jordan Brand dropped anad that shows a purple and gold Koenigsegg Regera— which, the company stated in a press release, is “one of Luka’s favorite cars” — with someone replacing its Texas license plate with one from California, asGeorge Strait’s “All My Ex’s Live in Texas”played in the background. Both plates read “77,” which is Doncic’s number, with the new one also purple and gold.
The latest@Jumpman23ad for Luka Doncic ahead of Lakers-Mavspic.twitter.com/PpX148XZ6R
The car was parked outside L.A. Live before the game, with promotional items such as“new team scent” air freshenersand bumper stickers featuring such slogans as “Can’t Spell Luka Without L.A.” being handed out nearby.
Luka Doncic and LeBron James are playing inspired basketball, setting up the Lakers for success and paving the way for a championship run.
Inside the arena, Doncic wore his new Luka 4 sneakers for the first time. He also compiled his first triple-double with the Lakers (19 points, 15 rebounds, 12 assists) tohelp his new team notch a 107-99 winover his old team.
The free parking promotion wasn’t Doncic’s first, or greatest, act of generosity during his short time in L.A. On Feb. 10, Doncic’s foundation announced it wasdonating $500,000 to recovery effortsfollowing themassive wildfiresthat raged in L.A. County in January.

Want to fireproof your house? Here’s where to start,https://www.latimes.com/california/newsletter/2025-02-27/what-to-do-on-your-property-before-a-fire-breaks-out-essential-california,2025-02-27,"During wind-driven wildfire storms, the embers and small flames from the fire can cause a home to ignite, according to theNational Fire Protection Assn.

Embers are burning pieces of wood or vegetation that the wind can carry for miles. Any place embers land can ignite into what are called spot fires. These spot fires can grow into infernos that engulf your home.
The key to defending your property is to reduce the fuel that embers can ignite, create fuel breaks that prevent spot fires from growing and to keep fire that does start on the ground to reduce more embers from exploding outward.
That’s your assignment this weekend.
Experts recommend maintaining the structures (house, garage and shed) and the landscape on your property year-round.
Regular maintenance is important because California’s fire season is nowstarting earlier, ending later and getting drier than ever in between,the Western Fire Chief’s Assn. says.
It’s a recipe for drier vegetation into the late fall and winter months “increasing the likelihood of extreme, late-season wildfires,” the association stated.
You can take steps to minimize the destruction of wildfire embers and flames within thethree zones of your property. If you need help visualizing the three zones, Los Angeles Times staff created an interactive3D model of the zones.
Zone 1 is the immediate area around your home, within a 5 feet distance. This distance applies to any structure on the property including a shed or garage. These structures are vulnerable to embers.
What you should do in this zone:
By taking these steps you’re preventing embers from entering the home or latching onto combustible materials.
Zone 2 is the intermediate area within 5 to 30 feet of your home or any structure on your property.This zone is specific to the landscaping of a property and creating fuel breaks that can help influence and decrease fire behavior.
What you can do in this zone:
If you do have plants, choose those that are more fire resistant.
You’ll want high-moisture, low-growing plants said Times Staff writer Jeanette Marantos. She spoke with an official from the Los Angeles County Fire Department’s Fuel Modification Unit on fire-safe landscaping that can be foundhere.
You can also check out thedepartment’s plant selection guidelines, which lists plant names and the safest zone to plant them in.
Zone 3 is the extended zone within 30 to 100 feet of your home.Your goal in this zone is to interrupt the fire’s path, keep flames smaller and on the ground instead of jumping to your home.
What you can do in this zone:
For example, if you live in a neighborhood where the homes are close together, there is an increased risk of building-to-building ignition because heat and flames can easily jump from one home to another, according to theCalifornia Fire Safe Council.
Neighbors whose homes are farther apart face another risk: The vegetation and other combustible materials in between properties can fuel a wildfire.
Wildfires are getting more intense. This seven-part newsletter course will teach you everything you need to know to prepare.
Whether you’re a couple of feet away from your neighbor or hundreds, you should be working together to make your homes defensible against wildfires.

‘Houses don’t get funerals’: Artists offer free portraits of homes lost in L.A. fires,https://www.latimes.com/lifestyle/story/2025-02-27/artists-offer-free-paintings-of-homes-lost-to-wildfires-in-pacific-palisades-altadena,2025-02-27,"First came the “wows,” followed by waves of emotion.
“I thought we were done with the tears,” said Seth Fonti, a 44-year-old father of two, his eyes glassy. “Apparently not.”
As Fonti and his wife, Rachael Klein, 44, gazed at the 8-by-10-inch oil painting of thePacific Palisades homethey lost in the January wildfires, the couple couldn’t help but become flooded with memories of the life they’d built over the past decade.
“For me, it was seeing the stairs — the entry that we walked so many times, where we watched people come up and hugged them in the open door,” Klein said. “The fire was the end of something magical.”
As Fonti and Klein stared at the simulacrum of the home they’d shared for the last decade, their grief commingled with gratitude for having experienced so many firsts in that singular location: firsthome as a married couple, first time bringing a baby home from the hospital, first steps, first days of school.
The painting wasn’t just a forever reminder of the home they once had; it’s the first item they now own for theirnext house.
Swathed in shades of yellow ochre and Naples orange to re-create the façade of the home and manganese blue to capture the ocean view behind it, the oil portrait Fonti and Klein received was painted by West L.A. artistRuth Askrenand given to them free of charge through a newly created collective known asHomes in Memoriam.
Started during the thick of the fires, Homes in Memoriam is a joint project created by two native Palisades residents who wanted to provide comfort to those who lost everything from their former lives in the January fires.
Ashley Miller, a 24-year-old whose family home was destroyed in the disaster, created the Instagram account almost immediately after the fires began. As a licensed therapist, she had offered her services at a localemergency shelterbut was gently turned down because there were more people wanting to volunteer than there were seeking help.
She then remembered a gift she’d received a few years back — a painting of a house she’d lived in during college — and decided she wanted to provide something similar to those who no longer had tangible reminders of a place they once called home.
“This was something different I could do,” Miller said. “For families to be able to have something to remember their home by when a lot of us weren’t even able to get anything out before they burned down, I just felt that would be really impactful.”
Interior designer Amy Beemer Lev, 32, who grew up in the same Pacific Palisades neighborhood as Miller, had a similar idea. Although her family no longer lived in the Palisades and she now resides in the Bay Area, she sought a solution for giving back that didn’t involve money or donations.
“There are some things you just can’t buy or replace, and a home is where you spend most of your time and make most of your memories,” said Beemer Lev. “It’s about more than just the things inside of it, so having this kind of keepsake is special.”
The pair connected on Instagram after Beemer Lev found Miller’s Homes in Memoriam page, and they’ve been running the collective ever since. Beemer Lev and Miller are 10 years apart in age and have never met in person, but their shared background — they attended the same elementary school and discovered they grew up down the block from each other — created an immediate closeness that bonded them beyond their shared mission of wanting to help others.
To date, Homes in Memoriam has completed 200 portraits of homes in the Palisades and Altadena, with 178 paintings in the works and counting. The project has attracted participation from more than 150 artists across the country as well as artists in the U.K., Canada and Australia, with Miller and Beemer Lev, who are not artists, handling the logistical aspects of the collective.

Offering free art of homes lost to the Southern California fires is not an idea unique to Homes in Memoriam.Multiple artistsare offering similar services, eager to donate their talents and gifts to a healing cause. One endeavor,the Eaton Fire Chimney Projectfrom the photographer behind@houseofhollywoodon Instagram, offers free digital photos of the remains of affected properties as a means of capturing the homes in their final state before those sites are cleared.
Askren, who has painted four homes including Fonti and Klein’s for Homes in Memoriam, devised the plan to paint lost homes after experiencing “survivor’s guilt” for not being able to share in that collective loss. Her childhood home is located in the Palisades but was spared the fire’s wrath because of heroic efforts from neighbors who used hoses to fend off flames in the immediate area.
“For me, it was a matter of feeling really compelled to do something,” Askren said. “And this is what I do. I mean, this is it: I’m a painter. This is what I can do to help people cope with their loss in the smallest of ways.”
Through searching hashtags on Instagram, the 72-year-old artist discovered the Homes in Memoriam account and asked to join the fold. It’s one of the most common ways artists have discovered the collective, Miller said. Many were coordinating free paintings on their own and decided to join Homes in Memoriam after getting overwhelmed with too many requests or feeling their offers were getting lost in the shuffle of social media.
Mary England Proctor, a self-described “78-year-old married grandmother in Nashville, Tenn.” who has been painting since she was 6, has completed seven portraits for Homes in Memoriam. In an email to Beemer Lev, she expressed how much she loved making the art, although she hated the reason why they were doing it.
There are few rules that the Homes in Memoriam artists must abide by other than using colors in their works and creating a piece that is at least 8 inches by 10 inches. Many of the artists work with watercolors, like Proctor, who combines the medium with pen, and some artists create their images digitally. Askren prefers to use oil paints, opting for a less technical and more romanticized re-creation of the homes.
The artists choose their assignments from an ever-growing spreadsheet compiled by Beemer Lev. After completing a project, the artists mail the work to Miller, who frames and then ships it to the families. No money is requested for the assignments, but a GoFundMe page launched by the collective has garnered funds to pay for shipping costs and reimburse the artists.
To request a painting, families can send an email or Instagram message listing their name and the address of the home they lost along with photos. They also can make requests for specific motifs they’d like included in the works, such as their dog gazing out the front window, theoak treetheir grandfather planted or the car with the canoe on top parked in the driveway.
A post from Homes in Memoriam, somewhat ironically, appeared in Fonti’s Instagram feed the day after his first return visit to the Palisades. Calling it “the worst day of my life to date,” Fonti was immediately interested in the art program, particularly because his family evacuated with only a suitcase full of essentials, losing everything else in the fire.
“Sitting there with those memories in rubble, it’s really hard to describe, but that’s not how you want to remember your home, as just charred destruction,” Fonti said. “Houses don’t have funerals. But this initiative allows us to honor these homes for what they once were.”
Fonti and Klein are determined to rebuild on the same lot in the next few years. Although their next home might look different, its predecessor won’t be forgotten thanks to the oil painting they now have in their possession.
“I’m not going to turn the page and forget about it. And I’m also not going to harp on this the rest of my life,” Fonti said. “I’m going to pay homage in this new house to that old house, whether it’s by putting the painting up on the wall right when you walk in or somewhere else, so that chapter of our lives is appropriately remembered.”
As the rest of the city and county moves on from the fires, Homes in Memoriam will continue operating. Miller and Beemer Lev have no plans to slow down the project anytime soon. They expect to receive painting requests over the next few years as people move through their grieving processes.
“It’s OK if it feels too fresh right now,” Miller said. “Come back a year from now, and we’ll have it done for you.”

Is the water in Pacific Palisades safe to drink? L.A.’s DWP has launched a website so you can find out,https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2025-02-26/how-to-navigate-ladwp-dashboard,2025-02-27,"Pacific Palisades residents who have been unable to safely use their tap water due to carcinogens in the system have a new tool to track their utility’s progress in flushing out the contaminants.
Since Jan. 10, most of the Pacific Palisades community has been under a “do not drink” order, when the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power advised residents to avoid drinking the tap water or using it for specific purposes.
The notice came three days after the Palisades fire started, out of an abundance of caution that benzene —a carcinogen present in gasoline, paint and consequently wildfire smoke— could be detected within the water distribution system.
During recent testing, more than a dozen volatile organic compounds were detected and traced to one specific neighborhood. LADWP officials did not disclose which neighborhood but said they were working to clean the system in that area and would test it before deeming the water safe to use.
To keep customers up to date, the DWP has launched thePalisades Water Quality Restoration Dashboard. It will give residents updates on the utility’s progress in cleaning the system in their area and let them know when their water is safe to use and drink.
On Tuesday,the DWP lifted the existing “do not drink” notice to customerseast of Temescal Canyon Road and south of Bestor Boulevard; an estimated 2,000 structures that weren’t burned down are now able to use tap water for drinking.
For the record:
3:33 p.m. Feb. 27, 2025A previous version of this article said a chart shows the restoration status for 113 zones in Pacific Palisades. The chart shows the status for the nine affected zones.
The dashboard details the plan to flush out the contaminants and restore the water for drinking, a map of the “do not drink” notice areas, and a chart that shows the restoration status for the nine affected zones within the Palisades community.
To see what service zone you’re in and the status of water quality restoration in it:
DWP officials said there isn’t a set cadence for updating the dashboard. When progress is made, the dashboard will be updated.
They suggest checking the dashboard regularly for updates.
You can check the progress chart of your zone for the green check mark next to “Lift do not drink notice” for the all-clear.
The DWP will also work to notify customers of the updated status via email, door-to-door notifications, prerecorded phone messages, local signage and through social media channels.
DWP officials said that once the notice is lifted you must flush your water before using it.
Here are tips from the utility:
Do.Wash clothes in your washer with the cold water setting. If the clothes dryer does not vent outside, avoid using it. Instead, hang dry clothes.
Do.Take showers with lukewarm water but don’t turn up the temperature. Hot water and steam can volatize these compounds and create a pathway for exposure.
Do.Use the tap water for vigorous hand washing with soap.
Don’t.Try to treat the water yourself. Boiling, freezing, adding chlorine or other disinfectant or letting water stand will not make it safe.
Don’t.Use tap water for food preparation or cooking.
Don’t.Use tap water for washing your pets.
Don’t.Use your hot tub or swimming pool.
Don’t.Use the tap water to hand-wash dishes; instead, use the dishwasher and use the air dryer settings.
The DWP is distributing bottled water to affected customers at the followingdistribution locations.
All locations are open seven days a week from 8 a.m. to 4 p.m. For more information, call the DWP at (800) 342-5397.

"300 tons of hazardous waste removed in 28 days: EPA finishes first phase of Palisades, Eaton fire cleanup",https://www.latimes.com/politics/story/2025-02-26/epa-hazardous-household-debris-removal-palisades-eaton-fires,2025-02-26,"In a major milestone for Los Angeles’ fire recovery, officials said Wednesday that the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has finished the first phase of debris removal in theAltadenaandPacific Palisadesburn zones.
Hazardous household items, including propane tanks and lithium-ion batteries, have been removed from about two-thirds of the buildings destroyed in the fires, the EPA said. The 9,201 buildings cleared include 4,852 homes in theEaton firefootprint and 4,349 in thePalisades fireburn zone.
The other 33% of buildings burned in January, or about 4,400 structures, were deferred to theU.S. Army Corps of Engineersfor additional cleanup before the hazardous waste can be removed, officials said.
A record-breaking number of people worked to meetthe Feb. 25 debris clearance deadlineset by theTrump administrationafter the January fires, the EPA said. The EPA had 30 days and it finished in 28.
Cheree Peterson, the EPA’s acting regional administrator, said 1,700 people — including EPA employees and contractors, California state workers, and about 200 active-duty members of the military — had worked to remove about 300 tons of hazardous household debris, including more than a thousand lithium-ion batteries.
Climate & Environment
The Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors voted 5 to 0 Tuesday to allow Calabasas Landfill to accept potentially toxic wildfire debris outside its typical service area and increase the tonnage limits at two other Southern California landfills to accommodate the fire-related waste.
Crews searched properties by hand for more than a dozen types of household waste, including common household items like bleach, paint, drain cleaner, pesticides, weed killer and aerosol sprays, as well as lithium-ion batteries, propane tanks, ammunition and asbestos.
“This is the largest wildfire response that EPA has ever engaged in,” Peterson said.
The agency met its deadline despite thewinter’s biggest storm, which prompted some mudflows and flash floods in the Eaton fire area and forced the closure of some parts of Pacific Coast Highway.
The milestone is a critical step toward rebuilding, because hazardous waste must be removed before crews can bring heavy machinery onto properties to begin clearing the wreckage.
The EPA opened four staging areas to sort and temporarily store hazardous waste before shipping it to specialized facilities for disposal. The sites promptedfierce protestsfrom residents who did not want the waste near their homes or protected waterways.
The EPA will close its temporary sites atLario Parkin Irwindale and atWill Rogers State Beachin Malibu within three weeks, Peterson said. She said the agency has to conduct final soil testing at both sites to “make sure there’s absolutely nothing there.”
Climate & Environment
California officials say state data have shown that wildfire contamination can extend deeper than 6 inches, contradicting FEMA’s claims.
The processing sites at the Altadena Golf Course and the former Topanga Ranch Motel on Pacific Coast Highway will remain open to sort, store and ship out waste found during the Army Corps clearance, Peterson said.
The 4,400 or so remaining properties that were not cleared by the EPA mostly have structural issues that made it unsafe for crews to enter and search for hazardous waste by hand,  Army Corps Col. Eric Swenson said.
He said some houses have deep basements that are inaccessible because the stairs burned, and others have walls that are still standing but are at the risk of collapse. He said the Army Corps will use heavy machinery to remove bowed walls and other hazards before starting the search for hazardous household items.
The Army Corps will use the same process as the EPA to find and remove hazardous waste, Swenson said. Crews will pick up  items by hand, place them in sealed containers and drop them off at the EPA’s processing sites, he said. Lithium-ion batteries will be picked up by the EPA, he said.
Residents can check the status of their property using theEPA’s interactive map.
California
In a heated community meeting, furious residents assailed federal officials for trucking electric vehicle batteries and other hazardous materials from Altadena to their area for processing.

"Newsom launches another podcast, teases conversations with MAGA leaders",https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2025-02-26/newsom-launches-another-podcast-featuring-conversations-with-maga-leaders,2025-02-26,"California Gov. Gavin Newsom announced on Wednesday the launch of his new “This is Gavin Newsom” podcast, which the Democratic leader said will feature conversations with “some of the biggest leaders and architects in the MAGA movement.”
“I want to engage people that often I engage with in private and make public those conversations, and I think that’s what inspired this,” Newsom said at a news conference about his economic plan in Los Angeles. “I’ve had some interesting conversations with people I deeply disagree with, and we found a lot of common ground.”
The podcast marks the latest in a series of publicity moves from a governor who is seeking to expand his audience nationally and is widely expected to enter the 2028 presidential contest. Newsomlaunched a separate podcast in the summerand willrelease another book later this year.

The new project with iHeartRadio is expected to begin airing in March. In July, Newsom started a weekly sports and culture podcast, called “Politickin’,” with former NFL star running back Marshawn “Beast Mode” Lynch and sports agent Doug Hendrickson.
Sports
Gov. Gavin Newsom will host the weekly podcast ‘Politickin’’ with ex-NFL star running back Marshawn Lynch and his agent Doug Hendrickson. It premiers July 15.
Newsom will probably participate more sporadically in “Politickin,” which includes interviews with celebrities such as comedian Chelsea Handler and Dallas Mavericks owner Mark Cuban, once his new podcast takes off, said Anthony York, a spokesperson for Newsom. The show has aired less often since wildfires ignited in early January in Los Angeles County and commanded Newsom’s attention.
In a teaser promoting “This is Gavin Newsom,” the governor said it won’t be an ordinary politician’s podcast and he’ll be speaking to “people directly that I disagree with, as well as people I look up to.”
York said the unpaid podcast also gives the governor an opportunity to connect directly with Americans and share his perspective on the issues of the day.
“Part of his strength as a communicator is to help show folks a way forward, a way to articulate a message, and a way to fight back,” York said. “And I think that this podcast is conceived in that vein.”
The new podcast could suggest Newsom is growing tired of the more muted stance he’s taken toward the Trump administration since the wildfires broke out in the Los Angeles area.
The governor drew national attention in the 2024 presidential election cycle as a Democratic fighter against the GOP. He took jabs at Donald Trump, sat down for an interview with conservative host Sean Hannity and debated Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis on Fox News, garnering praise for his refusal to back away from a scuffle with Republicans.
California
Ambitious politicians often publish an autobiographical book as they explore whether to launch a presidential campaign. Will California’s governor be next?
But Newsom shifted after the wildfires and has played the role of a disciplined statesman eager to work alongside, instead of clash with, the Trump administration.
In a tarmac greeting at Los Angeles International Airport, private phone calls and an in-person meeting at the White House, Newsom has sought to mend his ties with the president that appeared to fray after Trump’s first term. The governor has been able to work directly with Trump as he seeks federal disaster aid in response to the fires to benefit his constituents in California.
It’s unclear how he plans to maintain his relationship with Trump if his podcast becomes an avenue for him to criticize the president’s actions in Washington again. Newsom mentioned the cost of eggs, tariffs, the power of executive orders and the so-called Department of Government Efficiency led by Elon Musk, the president’s chief cost-cutter, as topics he plans to explore in a video promoting the show.
On Wednesday, Newsom said he isn’t aiming to stoke political polarization and division with his upcoming venture.
“My intention is the opposite,” Newsom said, adding that he wants to understand the perspectives others bring and their motivations.

Scam center crackdown in Myanmar threatens humanitarian crisis in Thailand,https://www.latimes.com/world-nation/story/2025-02-26/mass-crackdowns-see-thousands-of-scam-center-workers-waiting-in-myanmar-for-repatriation,2025-02-26,"MAE SOT, Thailand —A new crackdown on online scam centers has led to more than 7,000 people from around the world being held in a Myanmar border town awaiting repatriation, and those helping them say the unprecedented number is straining the resources of Thailand just across the border and leading to delays.
The crackdown coordinated among Thailand, Myanmar and China follows Thai Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra’s visit to Beijing this month, where she told Chinese leader Xi Jinping that Thailand would act against the scam networks that have drawn in hundreds of thousands of people.
They are often lured under false pretenses to work in scam centers in Myanmar, Cambodia and Laos, where they financially exploit people around the world through false romances, bogus investment pitches and illegal gambling schemes.
Many find themselves trapped in virtual slavery.
Officials from Thailand, Myanmar and China are expected to meet next week to address the logistics of the crackdown as fears grow about a possible humanitarian crisis. They aim to establish guidelines for repatriations to avoid confusion, Thai Defense Ministry spokesperson Thanathip Sawangsaeng told the Associated Press.
Business
During natural disasters such as wildfires and floods, scammers often emerge to prey on victims.
As part of Thailand’s crackdown, it also has cut off electricity, internet and gas supplies to several areas in Myanmar hosting scam centers along the border, citing national security.
Amy Miller, Southeast Asia director of aid group Act of Mercy International and based in Mae Sot, Thailand, on the Myanmar border, told the AP she has never seen such a large-scale release of potential victims of human trafficking.
She believes Thai authorities are doing their best, but the task is overwhelming.
“The ability to get them over to Thailand and process them and house them and feed them would be impossible for most governments,” she said. “It does require the embassies and the home governments of these citizens to take responsibility for their citizens. It really does require a kind of a global response.”
Thailand’s deputy prime minister, Phumtham Wechayachai, on Tuesday acknowledged concerns and said relevant agencies were working on the situation as fast as they could to coordinate repatriations.
“I’m also worried that if we don’t hurry up the process, it would become a problem if they can’t handle it and let them loose,” Phumtham told reporters in Bangkok, referring to Myanmar authorities.
Logistical issues include verifying identities, which has complicated and slowed down countries’ repatriation efforts, according to a diplomatic source with direct knowledge of the situation who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak to the media on the issue.
California
The suspects are believed to be part of a large organization operating outside the United States. Arrests are rare because scammers often disappear after taking money from victims, authorities say.
More than half of the 7,000 waiting are Chinese, with the rest from a mix of countries.
More than 600 Chinese were repatriated over four days last week. Due to the large number, Thailand is allowing Beijing to handle most processing on their return to China. China chartered 16 flights.
Earlier this month, about 260 people from 20 countries, ranging from Ethiopia to Brazil to the Philippines, crossed from Myanmar into Thai custody as part of the crackdown. More than 100 remain in Thailand awaiting repatriation, Thai officials said.
Many were trafficked to Myanmar through Mae Sot, now a center of mass repatriation efforts.
On the road to Mae Sot, checkpoints displayed signs in Thai, English and Chinese warning Thais and foreigners of the risk of being trafficked to work along the Myanmar border. Soldiers on Wednesday checked vehicles and asked for identification.

"Despite the odds, Forrest Gump survived. When wildfires came, so did his bench",https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2025-02-26/forrest-gump-bench-palisades-fire,2025-02-26,"Good homes have good souls, just as beloved movies do. Rick Carter knows both.
On Jan. 7, the renowned production designer — for “Jurassic Park,” “Avatar” and more — had just settled in for the night with half an Ambien and his wife, Adele, when a concerned friend called their Paris hotel. A raging wildfire was threatening the Carters’ Pacific Palisades home, she said.
At stake: the three-bedroom house where the Carters had raised their two kids, wiped their noses, helped with history homework, prepped for proms, while he designed $12 billion worth ofblockbusters.
Modest by Hollywood standards, the handsome little home also contained a treasure trove of Carter’s own paintings and sketches, 1,000 pieces in all, as well as his most mystical keepsake: a bench.
Not just any bench, of course, just as the legendary Carter isn’t just any moviemaker.
For, in Carter’s backyard, shellacked by California sunlight, stood the familiar bench from “Forrest Gump.”
In the1994 classic, Tom Hanks ruminates about fate, resilience and providence, from a park bench that has become a part of movie lore in the way of Judy Garland’sruby slippers.
The bench’s lineage is open to debate, perhaps, with its own share of cinematic intrigue and minor plot twists. Beyond question, though, Carter’s wood-and-concrete bench — a pew, a piece of American iconography — somehow withstood the ferocious fires that leveled Carter’s longtime home.
Charred, sure. Broken, a little. Yet the bench survives, in the spirit of Gothic fables and improbable Hollywood endings everywhere.
Life is like a box of chocolates indeed.
Movie magic is an elusive soup, a mind-altering drug. It can be summoned by the writer, director, actors and the production team.
When Carter needed more soup, he wandered over to the bluffs less than a block from his house to gaze out to sea, bathe in its breezes, imagine incredible new worlds. Re-juiced and reborn, he would return to his backyard studio to work on his paintings or the latest Hollywood epic.
Smash cut to Jan. 7, when Carter’s two Oscars for “Avatar” and “Lincoln” melted like candles. A stone Buddha survives, as does some of Carter’s books on John Lennon, his hero. Except for the bench, all else is lost.
The tally is still coming in on thecinematic touchstones lostin the January fires. The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences says several members have reached out to replace missing Oscars, and a stash of overstock stands ready.
The bench did not come out completely unscathed. There are scorch marks and some bottom slats are damaged and loose. The three concrete supports remain mostly intact, though two have peeled a bit, so that the underlying fiberglass peeks through. Somehow, the three slats across the back were untouched by flames that melted steel beams and cookware.

“Just as Forrest seemed to exist in some sort of protective bubble, so did this bench,” Carter says.
“To me, the whole movie is a miracle,” saysEric Roth, who penned the Oscar-winning screenplay. “That the bench survived doesn’t surprise me at all.”
As production designer for 21 films, Carter oversaw the artists, carpenters, effects wizards, set designers — nearly every visual aspect, from velociraptors to runaway polar trains.
He takes a wisp of an idea, a what-if, and turns it into a viable aesthetic. His creative resourcefulness has placed him at the elbow of the industry’s mad geniuses: Steven Spielberg,James Cameron, J.J. Abrams and Robert Zemeckis, who directed “Forrest Gump.”
At 74, he still boasts a boyish mop of hair and a poet’s hearty outlook. Between sips of cappuccino, his creative spirit sparkles as he discusses Chronos and the Greek concept of emotional time. It’s easy to see how he could serve as a muse to other muses.
“On set, I would say to Steven, ‘I can tell that you’re about to have a good idea,’” Carter says. “Spielberg would ask me what I meant. And a minute later, there it was.”
Early in his career, he realized, “I would’ve loved this job when I was 10. I’m getting paid to be a swashbuckler. … This is the joyousness of youth.”
Certain symbols allow themselves to be seen. That’s why that bench still exists.
— Rick Carter
For Zemeckis’ masterpiece, Carter and set decorator Nancy Haigh crafted three park benches — one for Hanks, the other two as background. (At 11 feet long, they are slightly different from the one pictured in movie posters.) Forrest used the bench as a pulpit from which to tell strangers about his improbable life.
Questions remain whether this is The Bench, for the three interchangeable perches were treated equally as they were carted about.
As the 1994 movie became a worldwide sensation, winningbest picture and five other Oscars, Paramount also produced 10 souvenir benches for Hanks, Roth and others, including one that sits prominently on the studio lot. (Fans have sought out the bench at a square in Savannah, Ga., where Hanks’ scenes were filmed, only to be disappointed.)
As a connoisseur of movie magic, Carter is convinced his bench is the centerpiece bench. To confirm it beyond doubt, Carter considered testing for Hanks’ DNA. But that proved impossible, given the bench’s outdoor life, where it was used as a jungle gym for neighborhood kids, or a couch for friends to sit and philosophize about this piece of movie history.
“Over the years, we’ve had a lot of very interesting conversations on that bench,” he says.
Whether it’s the exact bench seems secondary to Carter. For a fact, he knows the bench appeared in the movie. In his heart, it’s the one. Even its fire survival is “Gumpian,” to use one of his favorite expressions.
“Certain symbols allow themselves to be seen,” Carter explains. “That’s why that bench still exists.
“It means something for it to survive.”
Here’s an elevator pitch for “Forrest Gump” ($678 million worldwide):
A numpty misfit falls for a beautiful and broken woman whose eyes are like a flock of doves. In the course of a lifelong courtship, he becomes a Vietnam War hero, seafood tycoon, pingpong champ and famed runner who finally wins and repairs his broken girl, loses the girl and eventually finds peace and solace in raising their son.
Never in a million years would it get made today. As its screenwriter says, it’s a miracle it was made even back then, when Hollywood still had a big appetite for mainstream family features.
“I think that movie casts a spell,” he says.
It exists today on a higher plane, just as it did in 1994. Mirthfully nostalgic and inspirational, it shuns the post-modern cynicism of the era.
Forrest may have a subpar IQ, but in every difficult circumstance, he exhibits exceptional character. He saves not just his fellow soldiers but the lives of troubled friends, fellow runners, the love of his life.
“He always leads with his heart,” Carter says.
Which is what movie heroes used to do.
“Steven used to say, ‘What’s the establishing shot of your idea?’” Carter recalls, when Spielberg wanted to turn a concept into reality.
Carter is looking for that establishing shot in his life right now, for some firm idea of what lies ahead. For now, he’s in a kind of purgatory.
“This is a major test of the resiliency of the human spirit,” he says. “You can get very sad and very bitter, which is never good for anyone.”
Will he and Adele rebuild? Move on? Like many in the Palisades and Altadena, they are waiting for final verdicts on insurance, rebuilding costs, permitting, debris removal. At that point, they’ll make their Gumpian, life-altering call.
For years, Susie Chung’s students delighted in playing on the Steinway piano Lady Gaga used at the 2019 Oscars. Now it, along with Chung’s home and studio, are gone.
On a recent Sunday, Carter’s son Jim backs a truck up to the ash-filled lot, site of where he grew up with his sister, Amee.
For weeks, the bench has stood in open view amid the chimneys, water heaters and husks of cars, the remnants of this nightmare. Now, it is time to take it to an East Los Angeles gallery for others to ponder and appreciate, like some ancient shroud.
“The hook is: What does it take to last,” Carter says, “at a time when everything is so ephemeral?
“What does authenticity mean?” Carter continues. “It means to survive, to go deep. Maybe that’s what that movie meant.”
In the final scene of “Forrest Gump,” a white feather dances from Forrest’s feet, into the air, representing one of the movie’s major threads: Are life’s joys and agonies predestined, or are they indiscriminate? Do faith and good behavior even matter?
Hard questions such as those are now front and center in Carter’s life — including that weathered bench, where Forrest once conveyed his belief in decent outcomes.
The lifelong artist believes that “creativity is the antidote to destruction.” As is his way, Carter is giving serious thought to how to handle his grief over his lost artwork and treasured home. If given the chance, he says, he and his wife would rebuild it just as it was.
“You’ve got to keep moving,” he says, “but that doesn’t mean you can’t sit and contemplate.”
Perhaps from a comfortable perch, ideally a bench, whether from a movie or not.
Erskine is a special correspondent.
Carter’s bench will be on display March 8-29, at Berrics Art Society, 609 S. Anderson St., Los Angeles. The event features movie design elements and costumes. Admission is free.

"In ‘Running Point,’ Kate Hudson gets having to prove yourself, like Lakers boss Jeanie Buss",https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/tv/story/2025-02-26/kate-hudson-running-point,2025-02-26,"In the middle of our interview, Kate Hudson decides to ask Google a question. She takes out her phone, holding it up to her face with manicured fingers. She’s wearing a gray, precisely tailored Thom Browne suit — tie included — and her lap is covered by a blanket. For Los Angeles, it is a cold and rainy day, and the room at Netflix’s Hollywood complex is a bit chilly.
“Is the highest percentage of people in the world get into the family business?” she asks, trying to amend her language for the machine. She realizes this isn’t going to work. “Terrible, Google. Terrible, Google. That was the wrong thing to say.”
But Hudson is trying to prove something.
In her new Netflix series, “Running Point,” premiering Thursday, she plays Isla Gordon, a character loosely based on executive producerJeanie Buss, the current president of the Los Angeles Lakers, who took over the business from her legendary father, Jerry. I wonder what that was like for Hudson, who famously followed her movie star mom, Goldie Hawn, to become a movie star herself, and who currently hosts a podcast with her brother Oliver. Like Buss, she too has stayed close to her family’s industry.
She initially brushes off the comparison. For Hudson, 45, going into art and taking over a corporation are totally different paths, but she does think genetics might have something to do with the choice to follow in your parents’ footsteps. Hence, the ill-fated Google search.
“I know one thing: Our family is a very right-brain family,” she says. “Some of us are a little more linear. There’s always differences, but when you grow up with that creative right-brain family, you can feel it.”
Even if Hudson thinks her character is probably more of a “left brain” — more math-oriented, practical — it’s easy to see where they meet as born-and-bred Angelenos who have lived most of their lives in the public eye. The overlap makes “Running Point” the ideal project for Hudson’s first major foray into television comedy. Although she makes a point to note that she was on “Glee” and that her first credited job was a guest stint on “Party of Five,” ever since breaking out in “Almost Famous” in 2000, Hudson has mainly stuck to movies. In fact, series co-creator Mindy Kaling didn’t even think Hudson would be interested when an agent suggested her for the project.
“It just felt like she was in a completely different area in our brains of a kind of performer, and we didn’t know she would ever do a TV show,” says Kaling in a phone conversation. Hearing she was up for it was “very exciting.”
Hudson, for what it’s worth, isn’t snobby about doing television, “I mean, who doesn’t want to do a show that’s fun?” she says, with a carefreeness that becomes familiar after talking to her for a while. But, she adds, if she’s going to spend time away from her kids, who are now 21, 13 and 6, she wants to have a good time. “I’m a very hands-on mommy,” she says.
Awards
The actor plays Birdie Jay, a vapid model-turned-fashion-designer, in the “Knives Out” sequel.
As soon as she saw the synopsis for “Running Point,” she was intrigued. “I was like, ‘If this is a good script, I bet I’m going to do this,’” she says. “I got nervous to read it because I was like, ‘Oh, if I don’t like it, it’s going to be such a bummer.’” It was not a bummer, and Hudson signed on not only to star but to be an executive producer.
In “Running Point,” L.A.’s team is the Waves, and Isla, a former party girl, is thrust into the gig when one of her brothers (Justin Theroux) is sent to rehab following a drug-induced car crash. With her new title, Isla must win the respect of players, team owners and members of her family, including her two other siblings (Drew Tarver and Scott MacArthur), who are slightly pissed they got passed over for the big job. Still, the Gordons are largely a loving family despite their many hang-ups.
“I couldn’t imagine Jeanie Buss’ pressure of taking on her father’s legacy and having to continue to build on that legacy,” she says. “Honestly, that is unimaginable to me, the pressure that someone must feel in that, but what I do understand, and this obviously is a comedic way, is constantly trying to prove to yourself that the things you are saying are actually things that could be in the best interest of the franchise. I definitely could relate to that feeling.”
What Hudson does know is Los Angeles sports. In fact, she first met Buss when she was 14. Hudson’s family were big hockey fans, following the Kings during the Wayne Gretzky years. At the time, Buss was running the Forum. “She took me around to show me things,” Hudson remembers.
While Kaling says that Buss approved of Hudson’s casting, the actor didn’t spend much time with her in preparation. “She gave us real artistic license,” Hudson says. “It’s such a fun world. She knew Mindy would nail it. She gave us so much fun insight.”
Hudson did incorporate some of her observations of Buss’ mannerisms into her performance. Wearing aspirational, tailored suits and dresses, Hudson’s portrayal of Isla is of a woman constantly making calculations even while occasionally saying the wrong thing.
“The one thing that I really thought about with Jeanie is I always feel like, and I did this with Isla, even when you’re giving someone your full attention there’s something that has to be done,” she says. “Like, ‘OK, I’m here with this person right now, but I know in the back of my head I’m about to do the biggest trade I’ve ever done in my life.’”
Music
The singer and actor dabbled in music for years before finally making an album. ‘Glorious’ features a song inspired by her mother, Goldie Hawn.
Not that Hudson herself isn’t juggling a number of metaphorical basketballs at all times. In addition to her acting career, she’s also a singer who released her debut album, “Glorious,” last year. (She would love to write a musical one day, she tells me.) She’s also an entrepreneur who, among other pursuits, has a supplements company, InBloom, and a vodka brand, King St. Vodka. The success of those enterprises has allowed her to be choosy when it comes to acting gigs. She also admits she’s the type of person that gets bored easily.
“I feel like even when I’m working on shows, sometimes when I have a couple of days off, I like to be busy,” she says.
Her “happy place” is telling stories onscreen or in music, but she adds, “I used to say I’d be really happy making my own candles and selling them on Etsy.”
Her co-workers describe her as indefatigable.
“We’d be shooting all day and we’d be working so hard, and she’d have big speeches and stunts, and she’d come up to me at like 8 o’clock at night and say, ‘We’re going to the best sushi in L.A. after we wrap, are you in?’” says co-creator David Stassen. “I’d be like, ‘No, I have to go home and sleep. I don’t know what scenes we’re shooting tomorrow.’ But Kate would go and she’d show up the next morning, and she’d be in hair and makeup running her lines.” (Stassen can’t remember the name of the sushi place but notes it is “in an office building in downtown L.A.”)
Brenda Song, who plays Isla’s best friend Ali Lee, confirms that Hudson is willing to keep going when everyone else is exhausted but adds that even while wearing many hats she makes time for the person sitting opposite her.
“She could have a million things going on, but if I’m asking her about, like, ‘I’m worried about my son’s binky,’ she’ll sit there and talk to me for however long, walk me through it, as if it’s the most important thing in the world,” Song says.
Though Hudson impresses upon me just how “right brain” she is — “to be an operator for a business is a completely different skill set than what I’m ever capable of doing or even wanting to do” — Kaling argues that Hudson is “one of the most rational-minded, old-school producers.”
“She is just a real grown-up and I get to learn from her,” Kaling says.
Stassen also says that Hudson was able to bring her specific knowledge of an elite corner of Los Angeles to the production. For instance, during one sequence set in the Waves’ arena tunnels, she noted there weren’t enough extras dressed to look like the VIPs that would be wandering around.
“We had a lot of concession vendors walking back and forth,” Stassen remembers. “She was like, ‘If this was a Lakers game, there’d be a bunch of fancy people in fancy clothes hanging out by the locker room and near the VIP lounge.’”
Hudson’s connection to Los Angeles is deeper, however, than just knowing what the inner workings of a Lakers game look like from the point of view of a celebrity. The show arrives just a month after the destructive wildfires in the city. Hudson is a Palisades resident; Her house was spared, but so many of her friends’ houses were not. In the devastation, she still feels profound emotion for the city.
“I remember going back to my house after all of it, and I felt so sad,” she says. “I remember driving up, and I realized that drive will never be the same ever, and yet I looked out and I saw the ocean and I saw the other side of the Palisades, and you just realize, what a beautiful place to live.”
I ask her how, at this moment, she feels about “Running Point” as a representation of Los Angeles and its sports fandom. On the show, the Waves are the center of the universe. In real life, she finds similarities.
“Anyone who grows up in L.A., you understand there’s all these different pockets, and they all have this special magic, and everyone’s very true to their areas,” she says. “Then there’s just your sports, and if anything’s going to get anyone out of their pocket, it’s going to be the Lakers, it’s going to be the Dodgers, it’s going to be the Rams — and I guess the Chargers too. And I just love sports, and I think that in times that are hard, it’s what gets people feeling this sense of strength and community.”

L.A. County supervisors vote 5 to 0 to let Calabasas landfill accept more fire debris,https://www.latimes.com/environment/story/2025-02-25/legal-challenges-and-local-votes-decide-toxic-debris-placement,2025-02-26,"The Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors voted 5 to 0 Tuesday to allow Calabasas Landfill to accept potentially toxic wildfire debris outside its typical service area and increase the tonnage limits at two other Southern California landfills to accommodate the fire-related waste.
Calabasas Landfill, a county-owned landfill in the unincorporated community of Agoura, is authorized to receive waste only from withina roughly 350-square-mile area, which includes about 70% of the fire-damaged area affected by the Palisades fire. The board unanimously voted to waive that restriction for six months, permitting Calabasas Landfill to receive ash and debris from the entire Palisades fire burn scar — and potentially from the Eaton fire and others.
County supervisors also approved an increase in the daily amount of wildfire debris that can be disposed of at the Sunshine Canyon and Lancaster landfills. Sunshine Canyon Landfill in Sylmar can accept an additional 2,900 tons of solid waste per day and Lancaster Landfill can receive an additional 4,000 tons per day — provided that the additional waste consists only of wildfire debris.
County officials insisted the changes were necessary to swiftly remove potentially toxic-laden debris from properties destroyed in the Eaton and Palisades fires, emphasizing the contaminants pose an immediate threat to public health and the environment in Pacific Palisades and Altadena.
“Some people, they just want nothing,” said Supervisor Lindsey Horvath, whose district includes the Calabasas and Sunshine Canyon landfills. “They don’t want anything to go to any of these landfills. And I can understand that frustration because they’re concerned about what this material is.
“And I also understand that we have to move this debris to a place ... for it to be safe in the community. And we have to make sure the best practices that we have in place aren’t just lip service,” she said.
Ahead of the vote, droves of Southern California residents submitted written comments and spoke out against the wildfire debris disposal strategy, urging the county supervisors to deny the waivers that would send more contaminated materials to local landfills. Residents who live near local landfills say the wildfire debris should be sent to hazardous waste landfills instead. They fear that toxic ash could drift into nearby communities during strong winds or leach into the groundwater table.
“We are scared,” one Agoura Hills resident said during the public comment period. “Our property is threatened, our families are threatened, our health is threatened — and we’re at your mercy. So I just implore you all to do the right thing. We know what the stakes are and you can’t unring this bell. This will cause irreparable harm to our neighborhood.”
The vote also followedheated protests in communities near landfills, including a couple in which residents stood in traffic and blocked trucks entering Calabasas Landfill.
More recently, dozens of protesters assembled at a busy intersection in Granada Hills, a Los Angeles neighborhood near Sunshine Canyon Landfill. Protesters, including Granada Hills resident Kasia Sparks, waved handmade signs objecting to the debris disposal plan and shouted in unison, “No Toxic Dump!”
“The problem is, these types of health-related issues aren’t instant,” said Sparks as cars honked in support nearby. “We’re talking decades in the making. But we don’t want to get sick and then have somebody 20 years later say, ‘Oh, we probably shouldn’t have done that.’ We want to stop the problem now. We don’t want fire debris in this landfill. We don’t want it. It doesn’t belong in it. So we shouldn’t be putting it in it.”
Public health officials say the wildfire ash likely contains a myriad of toxic substances from burned-down buildings, including brain-damaging lead and cancer-causing arsenic. In the past, testing found wildfire ash contained enough chemicals to beconsidered hazardous wasteunder California disposal standards, according to the  California Department of Toxic Substances Control.

Ordinarily, waste with high levels of dangerous chemicals  is typically taken to hazardous waste facilities. However, following natural disasters, emergency waivers and disaster exemptions can allow for potentially contaminated debris — including wildfire ash — to be treated as nonhazardous waste and taken to landfills that typically only handle trash and construction debris.
In the aftermath of the Eaton and Palisades wildfires, before any testing could be performed on the ash, federal cleanup crews began hauling this waste to local landfills, which weren’t designed to accept high levels of toxic chemicals.
The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, which is overseeing the debris removal and disposal, says its contractors are using water to prevent any windblown dust as they remove and haul wreckage from burned-down properties. County officials also tried to assuage concerns, saying there would be minimal risk of exposure if safety protocols are followed.
“The state has already determined [these landfills] can handle fire debris,” said Barbara Ferrer, director of the Los Angeles County Department of Public Health. “There’s much less chance of people coming in contact with it ingesting, inhaling it or touching it. We do rely on the proprietors, the managers at the landfills to continue to take the precautions that they’re required to take by law so that ... they’re minimizing exposure.”
The Board of Supervisors also held a closed-door meeting to discuss litigation over  fire debris from being taken to Calabasas.
The Calabasas City Council unanimously voted to direct its city attorney to seek a temporary restraining order in Los Angeles County Superior Court to block L.A. County from accepting wildfire debris at Calabasas Landfill.The city’s filingcited 2,500 homes and three schools within a mile of the landfill’s boundary.
“The County and Sanitation District have a legal obligation to ensure that only non-hazardous wastes are disposed of at the landfill,” Mayor Peter Kraut wrote in a letter to residents last Friday. “This is necessary to prevent irreparable harm to the nearby residences, schools and community.”
Separately, Calabasas  residents raised money to hire private attorneys tofile a similar suitin L.A. County Superior Court against the county. In that case, attorneys emphasized that, without testing, there’s no way to ensure the safety of nearby residents.

$14.3 million in fire relief grants roll out to artists thanks to Getty-led museum fund,https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/story/2025-02-25/getty-museum-artists-fire-relief-fund-palisades-eaton,2025-02-26,"Seven weeks after fires laid waste to neighborhoods in the Pacific Palisades and Altadena, theL.A. Arts Community Fire Relief Fundhas given $14.3 million to more than 1,700 artists and arts workers affected by the disasters.
Applicants approved for a grant from the Getty-lef relief fund were to be notified Tuesday afternoon. All applicants who lost a home (with or without insurance) as well as all those who lost an uninsured studio or work space were given the full amount they requested, up to $10,000 each.
Eighty-five percent of applicants registered as artists, and 15% identified themselves as arts workers. The program defines arts workers broadly and includes those working for commercial or nonprofit arts organizations in a wide range of jobs, including administration, education, security, food service and groundskeeping, Seventy-eight percent of recipients experienced loss from the Eaton fire centered in Altadena, 22% from the Palisades fire.
Entertainment & Arts
John Joyce University wasn’t a university but rather a tight-knit counterculture collective that drew painters, composers, poets and more. Their houses and converted garages burned, but residents are already talking about how to bounce back.
The fund is managed and administered by theCenter for Cultural Innovation, a nonprofit that since 2001 has helped artists secure financial stability. One of the organization’s primary goals is to provide relief quickly.
“Understanding how severely our cultural community has been impacted by the fires, we designed a program that would quickly get funds to those who needed it most,” Angie Kim, president and chief executive of the center, said in the announcement Tuesday. “We involved everyone possible to conduct outreach, connecting with arts employers, hiring community artists, coordinating with other relief funders, and attending neighborhood gatherings.”
The Center for Cultural Innovation worked closely with Side Street Projects in Altadena and Armory Center for the Arts in Pasadena to help guide applicants through the process.
Entertainment & Arts
Laura Begley and Evan Dresman had just moved into their dream Gregory Ain home and were preparing to sell their fixer-upper in Altadena’s Janes Village. Fire destroyed both.
Museums, galleries, corporations, philanthropists and individual donors from 28 countries contributed to the fund, including the Los Angeles County Museum of Art; the Museum of Contemporary Art; the Mellon and Helen Frankenthaler foundations; the Andy Warhol Foundation for the Visual Arts; Qatar Museums; the Ford Foundation; the family foundation of Mellody Hobson and George Lucas; Kate Capshaw and Steven Spielberg and their Hearthland Foundation; the Robert Rauschenberg Foundation; the Broad Art Foundation; the Mike Kelley Foundation for the Arts; Gagosian and Hauser & Wirth galleries; and Frieze.

"Winds hamper crews battling fast-moving Silver fire in Inyo, Mono counties",https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2025-03-30/silver-fire-moves-fast-in-mono-inyo-counties-as-wind-gusts-keep-firefighting-aircraft-grounded,2025-03-31,"A wildfire in Inyo and Mono counties spurred evacuations Sunday evening as it spread rapidly amid strong winds and low humidity.
The vegetation fire was reported at 2:11 p.m. at Highway 6 and Silver Canyon Road north of Bishop, according to the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection.
The fire jumped the highway and was threatening “multiple structures,”Cal Fire BDUsaid in a post on X at about 4 p.m. “Aircraft, heavy equipment and additional engines requested.”
The blaze had burned at least  1,000 acres as of 7:50 p.m., according to Cal Fire. More than 200 personnel were fighting the fire, which was at 0% containment Sunday night. The fire was moving at a “rapid rate of speed” to the east and northeast, according to the National Weather Service in Las Vegas.
Strong winds and dry conditions were hindering the firefight from the air. Several firefighting aircraft were grounded at Bishop’s airport due to “extreme turbulence,” according to Cal Fire BDU.
The weather service reported wind gusts of 25 to 35 mph with relative humidity at about 10%. A high-wind warning is set to go into effect from 8 a.m. to 9 p.m. on Monday, with the National Weather Service forecasting gusts up to 65 mph.
View of the#SilverFirefrom the Silver Peak@ALERTWestCamscamera.Latest update has the fire at 150 acres with a rapid rate of spread to the east/northeast.Winds at Bishop Airport are gusting 25-35 mph from the west/southwest with a relative humidity around 10%.#cawxhttps://t.co/DyO0CVqBMUpic.twitter.com/inMu8d66xZ
Mandatory evacuations were in place for portions of northern Inyo and southeastern Mono counties, including Laws in Inyo County, Chalfant in Mono County and the White Mountains Wilderness Area. Roughly 30 miles of U.S. Highway 6 was closed.
An evacuation center was established at the Benton Community Center, 58869 Highway 120 in Benton, according to theCalifornia Highway Patrol.

Edison customers are paying more for fire prevention. So why are there more fires?,https://www.latimes.com/environment/story/2025-03-30/edisons-wires-spark-scores-of-fires-each-year-despite-billions-charged-to-customers-to-prevent-them,2025-03-30,"Southern California Edison’s electrical equipment continues to spark scores of fires in its territory, even though the utility has spent billions of dollars on prevention measures that are costing the average customer more than $300 a year.
Edison’s spending on insulated wires, tree trimming, weather stations and increased equipment inspections now accounts for roughly 15% of the average utility bill, up from 9% two years ago, according to the state Public Utilities Commission’s public advocates office.
The company dedicated $1.9 billion for wildfire-related spending last year, up 29% from the year before, according to state officials. Every month, $26 of the average customer bill —now $175— goes to cover those costs.
Despite that spending, there were 178 fires sparked last year by equipment owned by Edison, which serves 15 million people in Southern and Central California, according to data the utility reports to the state. That’s up from 107 in 2015.
“We are spending tens of billions of dollars to not be one whit more safe,” said Loretta Lynch, former president of the Public Utilities Commission.
Lynch and others say much of the blame goes to a state law signed by Gov. Gavin Newsom in 2019, Assembly Bill 1054, which limited the financial liability of utilities for wildfires they caused.


































By allowing utilities to shift the cost of damages from wildfires to customers, even when the blazes were caused by company mistakes, the utilities have less of an incentive to mitigate wildfire risks, Lynch said.
At the same time, state auditors have faulted utility regulators for not ensuring the companies’ fast-rising spending to prevent wildfires was effective.
Edison’s actions to prevent wildfires have come under scrutiny in the wake of the devastating Eaton wildfire that killed 17 people and destroyed 10,000 homes and other structures.
Scores of lawsuits have been filed against the Rosemead-based utility and its parent company, Edison International, alleging its equipment sparked the conflagration. Videos captured the inferno igniting Jan. 7 under one of the company’s transmission towers in Eaton Canyon.
Edison said it is investigating the cause of the Eaton fire, but said that the effort is in the early stages and could take 18 months to complete. “We are focused on a thorough and transparent investigation,” a company spokesperson said.
Edison executives say the costs of tree trimming and other work have made customers safer. They have repeatedly touted those efforts to the company’s investors, saying the work has reduced the risk of a catastrophic wildfire bymore than 85%since 2017.
In a recent interview, Raymond Fugere, a top Edison wildfire safety executive, said the 85% figure is based on a number of factors, including analyses by the company and third parties of the effectiveness of its fire prevention work.
Edison increased its fire-prevention spending in the wake of devastating California wildfires in 2017 and 2018. Since then, the company has installed 6,400 miles of fire-resistant insulated power lines, removed trees, increased inspections in areas at high risk of wildfire and added AI-enabled cameras to spot wildfires.
“If it wasn’t for a lot of these mitigations, there could have been more fires,” Fugere said. “We keep working and are trying to harden that system to protect the customers.”
Scientists say that climate change hasexacerbated the risksfrom wildfires in California by creating hotter and drier fire seasons.
Fugere said the number of ignitions caused by Edison’s infrastructure, which are mostly small fires that don’t spread, go up and down each year because they tend to vary with the weather. That was the case, he said, when ignitions jumped from 90 in 2023 to 178 in 2024.
“In 2024 we had a heavy rain in a very short period of time,” he said. “And then it kind of dried out. And so you had all this growth of vegetation … Weather is really the big thing.”
Even so, there are still dozens of wildfires every year that are sparked by equipment operated by Edison and the state’s other two big investor-owned utilities, Pacific Gas & Electric and San Diego Gas & Electric.
The state’s Wildfire Safety Advisory Board reviewed the annual fire ignition figures from the three big utilities Dec. 4. Jessica Block, a UC San Diego scientist who chairs the board, said it “didn’t look like a whole lot of progress was being made” toward fire prevention.
AB 1054 slashed utilities’ liability for fires caused by their equipment. It changed the law so that such companies are now automatically deemed to have acted “prudently” as long as they’ve obtained an annual safety certification from state regulators prior to any fire.
Practically, that means the utility companies still must pay for $1 billion in wildfire insurance coverage. But any damages to those affected by wildfires caused by their equipment that tops $1 billion now will be covered by a state fund that was $12 billion as of January and is eventually targeted to reach $21 billion. Half of the initial money in the fund came from shareholders of the three big utilities. The rest comes from a monthly charge on customers’ bills.
Edison has credited AB 1054 with significantly limiting the company’s liability for wildfires that its equipment ignites. In asecurities filinglast year, Edison said that because of AB 1054, any uninsured costs from wildfires after the law’s adoption in July 2019 “are probable of recovery through electric rates” — rates that are paid by its customers.
One question facing Edison now is potential liability from the Eaton fire. It has told its investors that AB 1054 and the safety certificate granted to it by California regulators in October will ease the possible financial hit. Damage from the Eaton and Palisades fires in January combinedhas been estimatedat more than $250 billion.
The company said in apresentation to Wall Street analystsFeb. 27 that if its equipment is found to have started the Eaton fire, it wouldn’t have to reimburse the state wildfire fund for claims paid to victims unless outside parties could raise “serious doubt” that it had acted prudently. Even if that happened, the company said, the law would cap its liability to $3.9 billion.
Regulators from the state Office of Energy Infrastructure Safety granted Edison a safety certificate Oct. 31 — despite myriad problems they found in its fire prevention work.
For example, the regulators said the company had not considered rare high-wind events in their calculations of how to stop electrical equipment-caused fires. The company looked at high-wind events over the last 20 years, instead of a longer period.
The company “may be underestimating risks of ignition and high consequence, and therefore not hardening these assets because they are not identified,” the office wrote.
According to the report, the company also had thousands of open work orders to fix equipment problems found in inspections.
TheTimes detailed this monththat Edison had dozens of pending work orders for clearing vegetation and other crucial work on three transmission lines near the ignition site of the Eaton fire.
April Maurath Sommer, executive director of the Wild Tree Foundation, a nonprofit environmental group, said that state officials responsible for overseeing fire prevention efforts by utilities have relaxed their standards since the adoption of AB 1054.
Before the law was passed, the commission held public hearings on utilities’ fire prevention efforts and the cost, she said. That no longer happens.
“There’s been a rollback of scrutiny,” she said.
Areport by the California state auditorin March 2022 faulted the Office of Energy Infrastructure Safety for issuing safety certificates to utilities despite serious deficiencies in the latter’s plans for reducing wildfire risk.
A spokesperson for the Energy Safety office declined to address why Edison’s safety certificate was approved despite problems identified by its staff. In a statement, he said AB 1054 had reduced wildfire risk, including by prompting the utilities to replace aging equipment and increase the frequency of inspections.
The state Public Utilities Commission, which operates separately from the energy safety office, has the responsibility to evaluate whether wildfire prevention costs charged to customers are reasonable. It also has authority to fine utilities when they violate safety regulations.
The auditors criticized the utilities commission for not holding the electric companies accountable. The commission “does not use its authority to penalize utilities when its audits uncover violations,” the auditors wrote.
Asked about that criticism, commission spokeswoman Terrie Prosper told The Times that the agency often sends a notice to utilities in violation of these rules, which gives them the opportunity to quickly correct problems without a citation or penalty.
An Edison representative said that in response to the problems found by regulators, it now uses 40 years of wind history — instead of 20 — in its safety plans, and that it also follows state regulations in inspecting and prioritizing repairs.
In 2019, when AB 1054 was passed, PG&E had declared bankruptcy because of liabilities it faced from devastating wildfires, including the Camp fire in 2018, which destroyed the town of Paradise and killed 85 people.
Early in 2019, the utilities asked lawmakers for liability protections that they said would strengthen them financially and ultimately help customers.
For example,Edison toldstate officials in February 2019 that utilities “should be deemed a prudent operator” and be allowed to recover costs from the fund if regulators had approved its wildfire mitigation plan.
At the time the law was being debated, critics pointed out that a decade earlier the Public Utilities Commission had rejected the utilities’ proposal to have ratepayers cover all damages from wildfires because of the“limitless potential”for those costs to be shifted to customers. Staff pointed out it would invite lawsuits by those who said they were damaged by fires, while reducing utilities’ incentive to prevent the fires.
Despite those concerns, AB 1054 was drafted and passed in a matter of weeks.
“The fund is protecting credit ratings of the utilities, but it does not protect public safety,” said Maurath Sommer of the Wild Tree Foundation.
Daniel Villasenor, a spokesman for Newsom, declined to answer questions but said in a statement that AB 1054 “is smart policy that has saved ratepayers and wildfire survivors billions while holding utilities accountable to some of the strongest safety standards in the nation.”
At a Feb. 19 committee hearing in the California  Assembly, an Edison executive explained how the utility has decreased the risk of wildfire in recent years by looking into the root cause of each fire its equipment starts.
Not all the committee members were convinced.
“How long are we going to let them just figure it out and maybe not figure it out, maybe cause some huge disasters before they have some skin in the game too?” Assemblymember  Pilar Schiavo (D-Chatsworth) said at the hearing.
“It feels like they’re giving dividends to their investors and raising rates on our constituents and then we have to cover…what seems like some negligence on a semiregular basis,” she said.
“We have to rebalance this equation,” she said.

California suspends environmental laws to speed rebuilding of utilities after L.A. fires,https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2025-03-29/california-suspends-environmental-laws-to-speed-rebuilding-undergrounding-utilities-in-la-fire-areas,2025-03-29,"In a continued effort to expedite rebuilding after Los Angeles’ devastating firestorms, Gov. Gavin Newsom this week suspended California environmental laws for utility providers working to reinstall key infrastructure.
His latestexecutive ordereliminates requirements to comply with theCalifornia Environmental Quality Act,cor CEQA, and theCalifornia Coastal Actfor utilities working to rebuild “electric, gas, water, sewer and telecommunication infrastructure” in the Palisades and Eaton fire burn zones.
Newsom also continued to encourage the “undergrounding” of utility equipment when feasible, which he said will help minimize the future fire risk in these communities.
“We are determined to rebuild Altadena, Malibu and Pacific Palisades stronger and more resilient than before,” Newsom said in a statement. “Speeding up the pace that we rebuild our utility systems will help get survivors back home faster and prevent future fires.”
The move builds on Newsom’s prior executive orders that exempted workrebuilding homes and businessesdestroyed or damaged by the fires as well aswildfire prevention effortsfrom the two environmental laws.
Politics
The deadline to submit a right-of-entry form to enroll in the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers’ debris cleanup is now April 15. Some multifamily buildings are now eligible.
CEQA requires local and state agencies to identify and mitigate environmental impacts of their work. The California Coastal Act, which made permanent the California Coastal Commission, lays out regulations for coastal development and protection.
Although the laws have been heralded by environmentalists, their processes have long been considered onerous by developers, and residents and officials have urged their requirements be lessened or waived to expedite fire recovery. The Trump administration also hastaken issuewith the California Coastal Commission — which typically regulates any coastal development as enumerated by the state’s Coastal Act — and has indicated further federal aid could have stipulations that target the commission’s work.
“The key now is to make sure that we move quickly to address the needs to underground not just traditional utilities for electricity but also water and sewer lines, and do it concurrently,” Newsom said in avideo posted on social mediathis week.
Joshua Smith, a spokesperson for the Coastal Commission, declined to comment on the latest executive order.
Previously, the commission’s executive director had clarified that coastal development permits are typically waived after disasters such as the L.A.-area fires, as long as new construction won’t be 10% larger than the destroyed structure it is replacing. That statement, however, has since been removed from the commission’s website.
California
The governor suspended the California Environmental Quality Act and the California Coastal Act as the state prepares for the summer and fall fire season.
In a letter sent last month,Newsom urged Southern California Edison,the area’s largest electricity provider, to do all it can to rebuild lines underground in these areas.
“SCE has the opportunity to build back a more modern, reliable and resilient electric distribution system that can meet the community’s immediate and future needs,” Newsom wrote, adding that he welcomed information and suggestions that would ease such efforts and keep costs down.
Installing utilities undergroundis much more expensivethan typical above-ground construction, which has limited the practice.
David Eisenhauer, an Edison spokesperson, said waiving CEQA and the Coastal Act will help the utility’s ongoing efforts to rebuild and move lines underground.
“We appreciate Gov. Newsom’s action to help expedite permitting,” Eisenhauer said. “This will help us continue this process of undergrounding and help the communities rebuild stronger.”
Archives
You can’t always stop wildfires from starting, but you can prepare for them.
Eisenhauer said SoCal Edison is already reestablishing and moving some of its electrical wires underground in the areas affected by the fires. Some of this work had been planned — and permitted — beforehand, including moving 40 miles of line underground in Altadena and doing likewise with 80 miles in the Palisades area, he said. However, this executive order will help ease the permitting process for future work.
It wasn’t immediately clear how other utilities might benefit from the executive order, if at all. Representatives for Southern California Gas Co. and the L.A. Department of Water and Power didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment.
Newsom has previously said his executive orders waiving these environmental laws do not signal a shift in California’s support of such efforts, though many environmental activists worry that such broad exemptions could have serious consequences down the road.
Bruce Reznik, executive director ofLos Angeles Waterkeeper, a nonprofit that advocates for clean waterways, said he understands the urgency to rebuild but those efforts need a balance that considers important environmental protections — not blanket waivers and exceptions.
“We all want to see the rebuilding happen as quickly as we can … but we also have to be smart about it,” Reznik said. “We have to build recognizing the reality of today’s climate change.”
Climate & Environment
Lawmakers are calling on the state to expedite rules for ember-resistant defensible space zones around homes that some experts say may have helped mitigate the damage from Los Angeles’ devastating wildfires.
He said the natural space in Altadena and Pacific Palisades was a big part of why people loved living there, and it’s important to protect those areas — as CEQA and the California Coastal Act do.
“These laws play a really critical role in making sure as we rebuild we’re doing it with an eye toward climate resilience, protecting against further natural disasters … [and] the health of our waterways and ecosystems,” he said. “Unfortunately, that hasn’t been the way the governor has operated, and you have to worry about what that will mean.”
Susan Jordan, executive director of the California Coastal Protection Network, said Newsom’s continued exemptions build on concerning environmental practices she’s seen in the fires’ aftermath, including the decisionnot to test soilin affected areas.
“I hope that the governor will one day recognize that the Coastal Commission is a willing partner and one of the best tools he has in his toolbox to ensure a quick, informed and coordinated response to establish future long-term resiliency along the coast,” Jordan said in a statement.

"Elderly, disabled were left stranded during L.A. fires as evacuation plans broke down",https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2025-03-29/la-me-la-county-emergency-planning-disabled,2025-03-29,"When flames erupted above Pacific Palisades on the morning of Jan. 7, Ben Kahn instructed staff to begin calling disabled Angelenos, even before official evacuation orders came.
“Go ask your neighbor for a ride,” was the advice the Disability Community Resource Center gave to people on their registry. They knew people with mobility challenges would need more time to flee.
What followed was a frantic DIY rescue effort. City and county officials had no such registry, so DCRC and other groups improvised, calling Ubers and Lyfts, even autonomous vehicles, to pick them up. They flagged high-risk cases — a woman bedridden with serious medical issues — to  the city’s Emergency Operations Center, just to make sure they were not overlooked.
“We’re kind of doing it on our own,” said Kahn, the DCRC’s disaster coordinator. “You didn’t have time to be stressed. It was kind of nonstop.”
By the time a new fire erupted 35 miles away in Eaton Canyon, they had already called hundreds of people. Chaos ensued in Altadena as neighbors scrambled to find cars that could accommodate disabled people andnurses wheeled elderly residents from nursing facilitiesas embers rained down. Some relatives wereunable to get past evacuation checkpointsto save loved ones.
The death of17 peoplein Altadena has shone a spotlight on L.A. County’s struggle to plan for the evacuation of elderly and disabled in a major disaster. The median age of those killed was 77, and at least a third of them suffered impairments that could affect their mobility.
After reporting from The Times revealed that west Altadena did not get official evacuation alerts until nearly nine hours after the Eaton fire started,L.A. County delays in alertingand evacuating vulnerable residents are now the subject of multiple investigations. They have also raised questions of whether officials could have done more to help those in need.
“The systems, which were supposed to have been in place for emergencies, not only didn’t function, they didn’t even seem to exist.” said Jenny, whose friend,Patricia McKenna, died in her Altadena home.
California
Senior living facility resident Dorothy Benesh, 97, was left behind in the Eaton fire. Her son says she would have died if he hadn’t been nearby to rescue her.
Disabled people make up about 10% of L.A. County’s population, and advocates have long warned that officials are not prepared to evacuate residents with mobility issues in a disaster. Less than 16 months before the L.A. fires, the California Governor’s Office of Emergency ServicesurgedL.A. County to do more to “adequately address” the emergency planning and evacuation needs of its most vulnerable residents and bring its plan up to speed with California law and “inclusive best practices.”
In a 2023reviewof L.A. County’s Emergency Operations Plan, Cal OES made 17 recommendations, including that the county develop a standard operating procedure for helping the mobility challenged to evacuate.
That didn’t happen.
Asked if officials followed the state’s recommendation to develop a set of instructions describing how to transport the disabled in disasters, L.A. County’s Coordinated Joint Information Center told The Times it would have to consult other departments to “provide a clearer picture of resources, such as Access L.A., that exist to aid in evacuations.”
“There is no one-size-fits-all approach to transportation in the event of an emergency evacuation,” the center said.
It will  probably take months to fully understand the county’s response. Officials declined to answer detailed questions about plans for transporting disabled people in an emergency, citing ongoing investigations.
“When an emergency arises that warrants activation of the Emergency Operations Center, the EOC acts as a coordination hub,” the center said. “But a host of other agencies are responsible for both planning and emergency response. ...  Real-time assistance is provided through a layered approach that includes 911 services, field incident command, transportation agencies, and city or county EOC coordination, if needed.”
::
The fight over emergency planning for disabled residents in Los Angeles, one of the nation’s most disaster-prone regions, began long before the Eaton fire.
In 2009, Audrey Harthorn, a Van Nuys woman who used a wheelchair  because of a muscular disorder, served as lead plaintiff in alandmark class-action lawsuitalleging Los Angeles city and county emergency plans discriminated against people with disabilities.
At the time, the county’s Operational Area Emergency Response plan — 455 pages long — made just one reference to the needs of residents with disabilities.
“For me this isn’t a policy debate or an academic issue; it’s a matter of personal safety,” Harthorn toldAbility Magazine. She noted that she lived alone, had no family nearby and could not evacuate her apartment in a fire or earthquake.
The countysettledin 2012 and agreed to a remediation plan that was declared complete in 2018.
But in its final review, Global Vision Consortium — the court-appointed outside monitor — flagged problems with the county’s readiness to transport people in a major disaster.
“It is strongly recommended that LA County conduct training with and for the transportation partners,”  the consortium wrote. It also urged the county to conduct “a major functional exercise to train people ... who will coordinate this activity and the community transportation organizations on what is expected of them and determine if they can perform as anticipated.”
They also mentioned “serious concerns about how the full activation of the county EOC would go considering that it has not been fully activated for a real-world event or exercise for many years.”
The Los Angeles County Office of Emergency Management did not answer questions about whether training exercises took place.
World & Nation
When flames bellowed up out of Eaton Canyon on the evening of Jan. 7, west Altadena did not, at first glance, seem to pose the most urgent challenge for evacuations. So why did it take so long for evacuation alerts to go out?
When Cal OES reviewed L.A. County’s Emergency Operations Plan in 2023, it raised concerns about the county’s ability to help residents evacuate and coordinate transportation.
The stateurgedL.A. County to establish “formalized, signed agreements with transportation providers” in and around the county to make sure vulnerable people could access free, round-the-clock transportation during large-scale evacuations. The county declined to tell The Times whether it followed that recommendation, and refused to provide copies of any agreements. But it said it did not follow another state recommendation: that it maintain a list of transportation agreements for use in the EOC.
“The Office of Emergency Management uses technology rather than a list to access critical resources like transportation,” it said in a statement, noting that a staffer from the county’s Internal Services Department can use the system to access and contact vendors to fulfill requests for assistance.
“It’s shocking, yet not shocking,” Cat Winesburg-Balogh, a longtime friend of  McKenna’s, said when she learned the state had issued 17 recommendations to the county in 2023 — at least some of which had yet to be carried out. “It’s very unfortunate they didn’t act upon it sooner.”
When Jenny, who asked her last name be withheld for privacy concerns, called McKenna around 7:30 p.m. on Jan. 7, encouraging her to come over to her home in Woodland Hills, McKenna declined.
The 77-year-old, who used a walker and would have needed help evacuating because she couldn’t drive due to vision issues, said she needed to pack and would leave once she got an evacuation order.
The order came too late.
McKenna was pronounced dead in her Punahou Street home bythe Los Angeles County Medical Examineron Jan. 12.
::
Some who run paratransit services say they would have provided vehicles to help evacuees — if officials had called them.
Mike Greenwood, chief operating officer of Access Services, a major paratransit provider in L.A. County, said he didn’t get a call from the county, city or a partner transit agency on Jan. 7 or 8.
“If we had been invited to come into the Emergency Operations Center and staff a transportation desk ... we could have homed in on what the needs were,” Greenwood said. “If the EOC was aware of the need to evacuate people, we would have been front and center to provide part of that assistance.”
During previous wildfires, Greenwood said the city EOC’s transportation desk, or a partner transit agency, would contact him if they needed help. Sometimes Access was asked to send vehicles to a command post to wait for direction. If needed, law enforcement would escort them to a location to pick up evacuees.
It is unclear whether officials used other paratransit companies to get people out of harm’s way.
When asked about transportation on Jan. 7, county officials declined to comment, citing the ongoing after-action review. “We expect that review to provide valuable insights to help the County enhance its collective response to future emergencies,” the county said.”
California
Los Angeles County keeps building in hillsides and canyons even as the fire risk worsens. For a century, the lure of development in natural surroundings has won out.
The heightened risk to those who cannot easily flee means that proper planning and coordination between the county and transit agencies is crucial, said June Isaacson Kailes, a disability consultant familiar with Los Angeles emergency planning.
“Why do they have to wait to be called in?” she asked of transit companies.
Too often, she said, disabled people struggle to reach transit providers as emergency lines are jammed.
“If it’s just call 911,” she said, “well, good luck with that.”
In the wake of the fires, some have urged that emergency officials reestablish adatabase that tracks residents with mobility or health challenges.
But Isaacson Kailes said that even if agencies could keep a list of vulnerable residents — something the county tried with its Specific Needs Awareness Planning (S.N.A.P.) registry, but scrapped it in 2016 after deciding it was too costly and had“low acceptance by the disability community” and “obsolete software”— the government does not have the resources to make a promise to respond.
::
As California reels from a series of devastating wildfires over the last decade, some disability advocates insist L.A. County has made significant strides in emergency planning.
While the old planning model was more top-down and government-led, new partnerships between advocacy groups and officials have become more equitable, according to T.J. Hill, executive director of the Disability Community Resource Center.
He said evacuation efforts were surprisingly successful, given the speed of the fires and number of displaced people.
According to the California Department of Public Health, about 850 residents of nursing homes, assisted living facilities and group homes were successfully evacuated during the L.A. fires. However, the county’s Office of Emergency Management is not responsible for evacuating people from such sites, which fall under the responsibility of various state and county entities. Manywere rescued by facility staffand hundreds were transported to safety byPasadena Transit bus drivers.
Some critics of L.A. County — including two people with detailed knowledge of its Emergency Operations Center — complain that the county has taken several steps backward  in the last six years.
Soon after the court-mandated monitoring of L.A. County’s remediation plan ended in 2018, the county Office of Emergency Management reassigned its point person for overseeing emergency preparations for disabled people in nonemergency periods.
California
Eighty-five people perished in the 2018 Camp fire in Northern California. Evacuations were a major weakness. What can L.A. learn from what happened in Paradise?
Asked why the county terminated the role, the OEM said the staffer’s role was a ” time-limited position dedicated to helping coordinate the CALIF lawsuit settlement activities.” Once the settlement was complete, that role was“woven into multiple levels of our organization — just as it is in many other emergency management agencies.”
Even if L.A. County’s emergency team no longer has a single person devoted to planning for the disabled, the county stressed that whenever an emergency is declared, a Disability, Access and Functional Needs liaison is stationed at the Emergency Operations Center.
“This liaison was in place on the night of January 7,” the OEM said in a statement.
During the COVID-19 pandemic emergency, the county disbanded its Access and Functional Needs Advisory Committee, a forum set up to help vulnerable people. Its last formal meeting was in 2019.
After committee meetings were disrupted by the pandemic, “OEM began reaching out more actively to individual community groups, town councils and other stakeholders on these issues,” the county CJIC said in a statement. “We found our other efforts to be successful even in the absence of this forum.”
As part of the state’s 2023 review, the chief of Cal OES’ Office of Access and Functional Needsurgedthe county to reestablish its advisory committee.
“When you start bringing community members to the table ... ultimately what happens is you build trust, you develop credibility,” L. Vance Taylor told The Times.
Greenwood, who previously sat on the committee, said reestablishing it would help improve communication.
But Hill described the committee as an overly formal, top-down initiative that was not necessary now that his group had regular calls with county emergency officials.
“The focus has been less about having a specific group that is focusing just on AFN,” Hill said, and more about “a community integration model” with more input from local stakeholders.
::
California legislators are examining how the state can do more to help counties.
Since 2016, legislators have passed laws requiring local jurisdictions toupdate their emergency planswith information on how they would serve disabled people andinclude disabled advocates in regular plan updates. In 2020, they required the state toreview at least 10 county emergency plans a yearto determine if they are doing enough.
At a March 5legislative hearing,Rep. John Harabedian (D-Pasadena) said the state had taken steps to guide, train and review counties since a 2019state auditfound California was not adequately prepared to protect its most vulnerable residents.
Still, he said, the L.A. fires offered “heartbreaking accounts” of people with disabilities dying as they waited to be evacuated.
Were the stateguidelinesand reviews, Harabedian asked, actually working?
Taylor, chief of Cal OES’ Office of Access and Functional Needs, replied that there had been improvement, but more needed to be done.
He stressed that Cal OES is not a regulatory agency, so it has limited power to enforce its recommendations.
Harabedian told The Times it was frustrating to see that the overwhelming number of people who died in Altadena were elderly or disabled.
“We fell short,” he said. “I don’t think that there’s any question that if we would have gotten notifications out earlier, if we would have gotten transportation vehicles out to get people out of their houses earlier, then we would have saved lives.”

3 incredible L.A. hikes to fill the void left by trails burned in the fires,https://www.latimes.com/travel/newsletter/2025-03-28/the-wild-los-angeles-hikes-alternative-trails-burned-eaton-palisades-fires-the-wild,2025-03-28,"Some people stay up late binging a TV show. I recently found myself awake long past midnight zooming in and out of maps, tagging every single hike on my outdoors app that I haven’t done in our local mountains.
It was an attempt to address the gnawing anxiety I can’t shake that, at any moment, a wildfire will break out and burn more beautiful places. Since theEatonandPalisadesfires, I’ve been full of regret over the trails that burned that I never completed. Although I had been up to Inspiration Point, which I hope gets rebuilt, I’d never completed the Echo Mountain hike. And I have never hiked to Skull Rock or been on theLos Leones Trail.
I told myself that evening, rather than going to sleep as I had intended to do, that I was going to make a list and tackle it accordingly.

I ended up with 73 trails, far more than I will get done this year. It was definitely part of my continued post-fires mourning process but also a good reminder of all the beauty that remains. And a good to-do list for me, personally.
In the coming weeks, I will roll out some of the 73 hikes I flagged and am eager to explore. In the meantime, I thought I’d recommend three hikes that can serve as new favorites while we wait for the land to recover. Say hello to your new besties.
Distance:4.4 miles out-and-backElevation gained:1,010 feetDifficulty:ModerateAccessible alternative:West Fork National Scenic Bikeway
Several beloved waterfall hikes are closed because of fire and storm damage, including Switzer Falls and Eaton and Millard canyons. Luckily, you can still check out Trail Canyon Falls, which descends at least 30 feet over large boulders.
To reach the falls, you’ll hike alongside the creek for most of your journey, crossing it several times. Even though this isn’t a challenging hike in terms of vertical gain, I recommend bringing poles to help navigate the creek crossings.
If you’re hiking with a dog, take care to discern the best place to cross, as the creek can be deep in the springtime. I once tried carrying my 50-pound dog Maggie May through a deep crossing on this trail, fell and found myself stuck against a boulder. Not my best moment, but bless the stranger who helped get Maggie and me to safety.
Shortly after you pass a picnic table (about 1.5 miles in), you’ll ascend to the exposed portion of this hike, where it can get hot in the afternoon. Thankfully nice views of the canyon below serve as a distraction. Sweet relief comes when you turn a corner about two miles in and can see the wide gorgeous falls.
I do not follow other hikers who trek down a harrowing path to get closer to the falls. Instead, I appreciate the falls from the actual trail and then walk past to a rocky outcropping near the creek, where I rest and have lunch. Regardless of what you do, remember that rocks near waterfalls and rivers are really, really slick. You have the option to continue hiking toward Condor Peak, but keep in mind that the route is challenging.
This hike can get busy on weekends, so plan accordingly in terms of parking.
If you plan to visit the accessible alternative, please note that it can also get crowded at peak times. The West Fork Trail, a paved path that runs alongside the West Fork of the San Gabriel River, is one of my favorites in all of Angeles National Forest. After a good rain, smallwaterfallsrun down the hillsides next to the trail. Regardless of how far you hike in, you’ll be greeted with a natural soundscape of the river rushing by and local birds chirping in the canopy of trees above.
Distance:Up to 5.7 miles out-and-back, depending on your routeElevation gained:Up to about 1,200 feet, depending on your routeDifficulty:ModerateAccessible alternative:Lower Arroyo Seco Trail
One of my goals this summer was to hike the entire28.8 milesof the Gabrielino trail. Unfortunately, several sections remain closed because of fire and storm damage.
My heart was happy, though, as I descended the well-maintained rock steps from the Red Box parking lot into the canyon. Thanks to hundreds of volunteer hours by theMount Wilson Bicycling Assn., this trail is in good shape.
Less than half a mile in, I had crossed over three trickling streams. I continued on past moss-covered hillsides, the rushing river and severalCalifornia bay laurels, pausing to smell their deliciously spicy leaves.
At 0.7 miles in, you’ll arrive at a crossroads. You can continue on the Gabrielino Trail or take that fire road (the Rincon Red Box Truck Trail), either way arriving at the Valley Forge Trail Camp. I continued on the Gabrielino Trail but did take the fire road back, as it’s easier to navigate and provides beautiful views of nearby local peaks.
Just over two miles in, you’ll near the trail camp. Take good care to ensure you’re on the right trail. Instead of following the Gabrielino Trail, keep your eyes peeled for the trail that descends toward the riverbed. Walk a flat path over the river and into the trail camp. If you find yourself up on a hillside looking down at the camp, you’ve gone the wrong way and should turn around.
When I visited last week, the trail camp was well maintained. There was even tissue paper in the vault toilets! I sat at one of the picnic tables admiring the large pine and other trees, towering several feet in the air.
Distance:4.6 milesElevation gained:810 feetDifficulty:ModerateAccessible alternative:Sycamore Canyon Fire Road
Often while hiking through the Santa Monica Mountains, you are doubly rewarded with both striking views of nearby peaks and incredible vantage points to gaze upon the Pacific Ocean. Big Sycamore Canyon Trail delivers in an epic way on both fronts.
Several miles of trails cut through Sycamore Canyon in Point Mugu State Park. Upon my arrival, a park worker recommended I take the aptly named Scenic Trail 0.7 miles to what they said was the best lookout in the park. How can you argue with that? After parking in the day-use area, you’ll walk through the campground to site No. 10, where you’ll find a yellow gate. Walk through it and take a gander at (and a photo of) the map before continuing.
On the Scenic Trail, I quickly spottednanday parakeetssquawking below a crow perched high on a tree. The trail is narrow in places and lush with plant life, including purple sage and flowers that appeared to be false bindweed (my palJeanette Marantosis the plant expert, not me!). I traveled up several rock and wood steps, gaining about 300 feet in elevation to reach the lookout point.
I hiked this trail on a foggy day, and even still, the lookout made me feel like a happy little bird perched high above the crashing ocean and the Pacific Coast Highway. (Note: I noticed multiple blunt butts on the ground and want to remind folks that smoking isn’t allowed on trails, in part because it poses a tremendous fire hazard. Also, please don’t litter!)
Next, I took the Scenic Trail north to the Overlook Fire Road. I hiked it a mile north, and saw more lizards than people on the trail. I also spotted severalsmallbluebutterflies. Loads of prickly pears grow up the hillsides. I enjoyed the view of Tri Peaks, Boney Mountain and Exchange Peak, a rocky trio of peaks who become more visible and striking as you trek through the canyon.
At the picnic table, I turned east onto Fireline Trail about 1.3 miles down. I heard several wrentits tweeting in the coastal sage scrub and stands of laurel sumac.  There are a few acres of dense orange, yellow and green sumac just below the trail that I’d recommend pausing to appreciate.
To finish my hike, I took the Sycamore Canyon Fire Road, a picturesque path shaded by several old trees, including the canyon’s namesake. It is popular among mountain bikers and, on the day I hiked it, babyrattlesnakes. I spotted the first one stretched out in the sun on the road and gave it wide berth as I passed. The next little guy was sleeping in the middle of the trail, less than a third of a mile from the entrance. I cautioned passing mountain bikers of their presence and went on my way. (And the reason I was able to remain mostly calm was because I learned so much reporting thisguideon rattlesnakes.)
If you choose to take the accessible alternative, which is the Sycamore Canyon Fire Road, please note it isn’t paved, but when I visited it was well graded. There was one rockier patch, but mountain bikers had carved out smooth lines that made avoiding the rocks easier. The trail is a gentle incline that I plan to take my mom along next time she visits. Always good to have a few solidhikes for visitorsin your back pocket.

Although the headline mentions it’s for “non-hikers,” ourguideon what to do in the charming towns near Death Valley is a great read for outdoorsy folks of all persuasions. Times contributor Jessie Schiewe writes about how visitors headed to and from Death Valley National Park should consider stopping for more than gas when passing through Shoshone and Tecopa, two small communities along Highway 127. Grabbing a date shake and hiking through the desert oasis at China Ranch Date Farm and Bakery sounds like a blissful way to spend half a day, followed by a stop to the Shoshone Museum & Visitor Center, where you can view 600,000-year-old mammoth bones. My friend and I recently passed through Shoshone on my way home from the park and found great food and service (and even a vegan option!) at the Crowbar Café and Saloon. The gift shop across the street was also great. Thanks to this guide, I will definitely spend even more time during my next trip to Death Valley!

L.A. Times sues city over Mayor Bass’ deleted text messages during fire response,https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2025-03-28/la-times-sues-bass-administration-for,2025-03-28,"The Los Angeles Times filed a lawsuit Thursday against the city of L.A., accusing officials of unlawfully withholding and deleting the mayor’s text messages and other public records from January’s firestorm.
The city has already turned overmany ofthe exchanges betweenMayor Karen Bass and other officialssought by Times reporters. But officials have argued they are not compelled to do so under state public records laws.
The Times disagreed. Empowering public officials to scrub their records or to decide which are subject to the law sets a dangerous precedent, Thursday’s suit argued.
“It’s bigger than these text messages,” said Kelly Aviles, outside counsel for The Times. “The city seems to believe they can destroy whatever they want whenever they want, and that they don’t have a duty to the public to retain public records.”
California
Mayor Karen Bass’ texts illustrate how she communicated remotely with her staff and across levels of government, trying to marshal federal resources as the conflagration exploded. They also show an Angeleno desperate to get home.
Politics reporter Julia Wick and investigative reporter Matt Hamilton joined the action as L.A. residents, aiming to block city officials from destroying protected material.
Bass was in Ghana when the fires broke out on Jan. 7. She joined a Biden administration delegation feting the country’s new president, despite warnings about the explosive potential of incoming Santa Ana winds.
That choice may well decide herpolitical future. Exchanges published by The Times this week gave the first clear picture into the mayor’s early actions as the city caught fire and burned.
Yet those exchanges with her staff and senior government officials could have remained secret, since Bass’ messages had been set to auto-delete after 30 days — far shorter than the two-year retention period outlined in the city’sadministrative code.
Officials initially told Wick those texts did not exist, and then said that they had been deleted. After months of back and forth with the paper, the mayor’s office ultimately said it was able to recover the deleted texts, and last week provided about 125 messages, noting that an unspecified number of others were “redacted and/or withheld” based on exemptions to the law.
“The Mayor’s office has responded to hundreds of public records requests since she was elected and we will continue to do so,” said David Michaelson, counsel to the mayor. “The Mayor’s office released responsive texts to a PRA request from the Timeslast weekand the Office will continue to respond to public record requests.”
California
The LAFD has not answered questions about exactly which engines were unusable and what was wrong with them. And city officials have slow-walked releasing maintenance records for each of the agency’s 195 engines.
Still, Michaelson told Wick the texts were beyond the reach of the California Public Records Act.
The mayor’s texts were “ephemeral,” Michaelson told Wick in a March 7 email, and thus protected from public scrutiny. He cited a 1981 Supreme Court decision that cast “fleeting thoughts and random bits of information” as exempt from records requests.
But that ruling does not apply to officials’ text messages and other electronic communication, Times attorneys argued. In an era of life-or-death decisions made on  6-inch screens, the paper’s suit makes the case that what politicians type with two thumbs is as durable as what they pen by hand. Under California law, any writing about public business, regardless of format, is covered by the records act and must be turned over.
“The City’s apparent position that an official may delete a text communication at any time as ‘ephemeral’ until a public records request is received would destroy the presumption of access to public records,” The Times’ lawsuit said. “All a public official would have to do to avoid public scrutiny is destroy the texts immediately after creating them.”
The mayor’s texts are not the only records City Hall appears to have destroyed, the lawsuit alleged. Nor are they the only ones the paper’s journalists are still seeking as part of their ongoing investigation of the fires.
On Jan. 9, investigative reporter Alene Tchekmedyian sought “emails, text messages, reports, planning documents and memos — about fire planning and predeployment resources” from then-L.A. Fire Chief Kristin Crowley and her subordinates.
On Feb. 19, City Hall reporter David Zahniser petitioned “copies of correspondence regarding emergency preparations, high winds, wildfire conditions and the National Weather Service” involving City Council President Marqueece Harris-Dawson while he served as acting mayor in Bass’ absence.
Zahniser received some records, but not the text messages he’d asked for. Tchekmedyian’s request was closed without any communications provided.
Questions about how American leaders communicate and what happens to those exchanges gained new urgency this week after senior White House officials were revealed to have mistakenly added a journalist to their Signal group chat while planning an air raid in Yemen.
California
In churches and community centers, on private Zoom calls, and at public food giveaways, lawyers and their swarm of assistants, marketers and “victim advocates” are ready and available.
For the record:
1:58 p.m. March 28, 2025A previous version of this article misspelled U.S. District Judge James E. Boasberg’s surname as Basberg.
On Thursday,  U.S. District Judge James E. Boasberg ordered the participants of that chat to save the exchange in its entirety and to turn over their records of it.
Shading such material from public records laws now on the argument they’re fleeting and inconsequential defies reality, The Times’ attorney said.
“What you have to retain and what you have to turn over is based on the content of the communication, not based on the form or manner of the communication that you choose to use,” Aviles said.
The suit seeks to ensure important records “are not just destroyed at the city’s whim.”

"L.A. fire contaminant levels could sicken the marine food chain, new tests show",https://www.latimes.com/science/story/2025-03-28/l-a-fire-contaminant-levels-could-sicken-the-marine-food-chain-new-tests-show,2025-03-28,"Levels of lead and other heavy metals spiked in the coastal waters off Los Angeles after January’s fires, raising serious concerns for the long-term health of fish, marine mammals and the marine food chain, according to test results released Thursday by the nonprofit environmental group Heal the Bay.
For human surfers and swimmers, the results were somewhat encouraging. Contaminant levels from sampled water weren’t high enough to pose likely health risks to recreational beachgoers.
But tests of seawater collected before and after the heavy rains that came in late January, after the fires abated, identified five heavy metals — beryllium, copper, chromium, nickel and lead — atlevels significantly aboveestablished safety thresholds for marine life.
Even at relatively low concentrations, these metals can damage cells and disrupt reproduction and other biological processes in sea animals.
The metals also accumulate in the tissues of animals exposed to them, and then make their way up the food chain as those organisms are eaten by larger ones.
“Most of these metals are easy to transfer through the food web and impact humans directly or indirectly, via food or drinking water,” said Dimitri Deheyn, a marine biologist at UC San Diego’s Scripps Institution of Oceanography.
All are found in dust and rocks, and aren’t harmful in the context of those minute, naturally-occurring exposures.
“That is why these elements are dangerous,” Deheyn said. “Our body is designed to take them up, but we are usually exposed to only a small amount of it.”
On Jan. 24 and Jan. 25 — before the rain that came the following week — Heal the Bay staff collected seawater samples from eight locations along the coastline in or near the Palisades burn scar, in addition to control samples well outside the burn zone at Paradise Cove in Malibu and Malaga Cove in Palos Verdes Estates.
They took additional samples on Jan. 28, after the first major storm in months dropped half an inch of rain on the L.A. Basin and flushed debris into the sea.
Theytested for 116 pollutants.The vast majority were either not present or detected in only minuscule amounts in almost all the samples collected.
But levels of beryllium, copper, chromium, nickel and lead were two to four times higher than the maximum allowed under California state law at Big Rock Beach in Malibu, where the wreckage of several destroyed houses stilllie on the sand.
“That’s not surprising as that’s where we haveburned debris within the high tide line, [where] every minute of every day the ocean is lapping more and more contaminants into the sea,” said Heal the Bay Chief Executive Tracy Quinn.
At the Santa Monica Pier and Dockweiler Beach, both of which are south of the burn scar, levels of both lead and chromium were roughly tripleCalifornia’s safety thresholdfor marine life. At the Santa Monica test location after the rains, the level of beryllium — a metal that is toxic to fish and corals and causes respiratory distress in humans — was more than 10 times the maximum limit allowed.
Further study is needed to determine whether fire-related contaminants are pooling in those areas or if the high levels are coming from another source of pollution, Quinn said.
“We don’t recommend that people consume fish that are caught in the Santa Monica Bay right now,” Quinn said.
The levels in these first results suggest that more testing is warranted, said Susanne Brander, an associate professor and ecotoxicologist at Oregon State University.
“Anytime there’s a large residential wildfire, this is the kind of contamination you’re going to see,” she said. “I would look at these results and say, OK, weneed to test soils, we need totest drinking water,.”
Quinn noted several limitations in Heal the Bay’s data. The samples were collected in late January, and may not be representative of current ocean conditions. There are also no baseline data showing prefire conditions in the same area to which they could compare their samples, because there are no regular testing programs for these contaminants, she said.
The organization also sampled 25 different polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, organic compounds that form when oil, wood or garbage burns. The organization expects results in the coming weeks, Quinn said.
January’s fires and the heavy rains that followed sent unprecedented amounts of ash, debris and chemical residue coursing into the sea via the L.A. region’s massivenetwork of storm drainsand concrete-lined rivers.
The Palisades and Eaton fires burned more than 40,000 acres and destroyed at least 12,000 buildings. In the months since they erupted, the remnants of cars, plastics, batteries, household chemicals and other potentially toxic material have continued to wash into the seaand up onto beaches.
“I don’t think there’s a precedent for this kind of input into the ocean ecosystem,” marine biologist Noelle Bowlin said in January.
In addition to fire contamination, California’s sea life is also under threat from an outbreak of domoic acid, a neurotoxin released by some marine algae species.
Hundreds of animals havewashed up sick or deadalong California’s southern and central coasts in recent weeks, in thefourth domoic acidevent in as many years.
While nutrients such as sulfate and phosphorous that feed harmful algae were among the substances the fires released into the sea, Heal the Bay said it has not found a correlation between fire-related pollution and the outbreak now sickening marine animals.
Understanding all of the effects that heavy metals, chemicals, bacteria and other pollutants released by the fire will have on the marine ecosystem “will take a huge, collaborative effort,” said Jenn Cossaboon, a fourth-year student at the UC Davis School of Veterinary Medicine who recently finished a doctorate on endocrine disruption in fish.
“Species at each level of the food chain, from invertebrates to fish, birds, marine mammals and humans, can be affected differently based on their physiology and feeding strategies,” she said. “It will be very important to connect each of these pieces of the puzzle to really understand the impacts on the food web.”

What to know about L.A. fires’ toxic slow burn,https://www.latimes.com/california/newsletter/2025-03-28/what-to-know-about-l-a-fires-toxic-slow-burn-essential-california,2025-03-28,"Good morning. Here’s what you need to know to start your day.

The flames were extinguished nearly two months ago, but the long-term public health effects from the Palisades and Eaton fires will be a slow burn.
As the devastating blazes consumed homes, businesses, cars and more, they also torched the hazardous chemicals and metal those properties contained. Toxic ash — which may include cancer-causing arsenic and brain-damaging lead — filled the air and settled into the soil in and around the burn zones.
As health experts and local leaders work to determine the exposure levels of first responders and affected communities, they’re contending with the pressures of rebuilding quickly and a controversial decision by federal officials.
Tested firefighters had elevated toxins in their systems
Researchers shared early results from what’s expected to bea ten-year study into the L.A. fires.
The team, which includes scientists and researchers from Harvard, UCLA, UC Davis and USC, took blood samples from 20 firefighters from Northern California who traveled to help contain both blazes.
The results showed that the firefighters “had levels of lead and mercury in their blood that wassignificantly higher than what health experts consider to be safe,” Times reporter Salvador Hernandez wrote this week.
The Northern California crews also had lead and mercury in their systems at levels three and five times higher, respectively, than a control group of firefighters who fought a forest fire alone, Dr. Kari Nadeau, chair of the Department of Environmental Health at Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, told Salvador.
“Researchers are still looking to expand the number of firefighters in the study, as well as the range of toxins they may have been exposed to,” Salvador reported. “Nevertheless, even these limited and preliminary findings bolster a growing worry among firefighters that the L.A. fires may have exposed them to metals and chemicals with long-term health effects.”
Dave Gillotte, a captain with the Los Angeles County Fire Department and president of the Los Angeles County Firefighters Local 1014, told Salvador that firefighters could face long-term health impacts similar to what9/11 first respondershave suffered in the decades after the 2001 terrorist attacks.
Fears of toxic soil meet rush to rebuild
The rebuilding effort in Altadena and L.A.’s Pacific Palisades neighborhood is underway.
But the optics of resilience are at odds with calls for caution among health experts and some elected officials concerned that the federal operation to get dangerous materials out of the ground has been rushed or inadequate.
The Federal Emergency Management Agency is managing the initial cleanup effort, but sparked controversy last month when they announced that federal agencieswon’t test the soil after clearing debrisand removing a 6-inch layer of topsoil on affected properties.
As my colleague Tony Briscoe explained, that decision “[breaks] with a long-standing practice that was intended to ensure that homes and schools don’t still contain excessive levels of harmful chemicals after environmental disasters such as a wildfire.”
“FEMA encouraged state and local officials to pay for soil testing, if they believe it’s necessary,” Tony noted. “So far, no state or local plans for soil testing have been unveiled.”
A group of eight federal lawmakers from California arechallenging the agency’s decision.
“FEMA’s refusal to test for toxins in the soil after wildfire cleanup in Los Angeles County is unacceptable,” U.S. Rep. Laura Friedman (D-Glendale) said in a statement. “Families deserve to know their homes are safe and free of dangerous chemicals. This … risks exposing entire communities to long-term health threats.”
Some residents are also concerned that L.A. city and county officials’ decision to not require soil testing when issuing most rebuilding permits increases the risk that residents and workers will be exposed to toxic chemicals. The Los Angeles Unified School District meanwhile said they are paying out of pocket for soil testing on their three campuses damaged or destroyed in the Palisades fire.
One rebuilding expert told Tony a lack of testing could impact property owners’ ability to hire contractors, especially if the process is left to thousands of individuals.

A pediatrician’s dilemma: Should a practice kick out unvaccinated kids?“Dismissal” policies were once discouraged, both because pediatricians have a duty to care for all their young patients, and because some anti-vaccine parents can be convinced over time to change their minds. But in 2016, the American Academy of Pediatrics came up with new guidance: Vaccines against preventable diseases like the measles were so important that if, after repeated attempts, a pediatrician couldn’t convince a parent to get their child immunized, a practice could righteously kick them out.

L.A. Affairs: Our home survived the Palisades fire. Our love almost did not,https://www.latimes.com/lifestyle/story/2025-03-28/la-affairs-evan-cooper-our-home-survived-palisades-fire-our-love-almost-did-not,2025-03-28,"I’ve been thinking a lot lately about a quote widely attributed to Tennessee Williams: “We live in a perpetually burning building, and what we must save from it, all the time, is love.”
When the Palisades fire broke out in January, forcing my teenage daughter and me to evacuate from our quaint canyon home while my husband was at work on the other side of town, I did my best to gather our most essential items before heading for safety. Drenched in a cold and sudden sweat, I grabbed our family’s passports, a baby album, my vintage Levi’s — tossing them all into a large silver suitcase.
As my girl and I crawled out of Santa Monica, inching our way through a clogged artery of cars, I felt as though I were in a dream: Neighbors lined the streets, loading up the trunks of their cars while a massive plume of black smoke hunted us in our rearview mirror. Between chatting nervously with my daughter and navigating the roads, it occurred to me that I’d forgotten my grandmother’s brass heart-shaped locket. I’d forgotten the framed photo of my husband and me from our honeymoon to Maui decades earlier. While my daughter tried to calm our two panting pups in the back seat, I worried: What else had I forgotten to save?
Lifestyle
When I saw the flames and smoke of the fires on the screen from thousands of miles away, it felt as though I had lost Eric all over again.
No one knew at the time that what began as a local wildfire would quickly come to decimate our city; a beloved small town within the larger landscape of L.A. And I had no idea that my own life — specifically my marriage and the little family we’d created — was itself about to be scorched.
When you choose to live in Los Angeles, you do so with the understanding that, at some point, you may be required to brace yourself for all manner of natural disasters. Earthquakes are the one that have always scared me the most. As a little girl living with my mother in Ohio as my father resided in L.A., I used to pray at bedtime that he’d make it through the night. When, at 18, I finally made my way out West for good, I began reciting the same prayer for myself.
Fires weren’t so much on my radar, but as it happens, they have the ability to shift the earth beneath one’s feet just as drastically. After days of uncertainty, staring at the Firewatch app as miles of hillside and countless numbers of homes were reduced to ash, we let out a collective sigh as we learned that our house remained standing. And yet with the entire contents of our home ravaged by toxic soot and smoke, we, along with thousands of others, were displaced, forced to find temporary housing.
Five weeks passed in a fever-dream of Airbnbs and air mattresses until, finally, we were able to secure a short-term lease on a place of our own. It was a minor miracle in the current L.A. market of limited availability and price gouging. Standing in the barren living room of an unfurnished Hollywood rental, my husband and I should have collapsed in relief. Instead, we did what any exhausted couple of 20-plus years might do: We fought.
“I need a break,” he said, jaw clenched.
“What do you mean?” I shot back. But after months of couples therapy, I knew exactly what he meant. He needed a break from us, or, rather, from me. Our dogs barked incessantly.

Despite changes in my life, I always took comfort from Eaton Canyon. Now that it has burned, I have to remind myself that nature’s gift in hard times is to remind us of its perpetual cycles.
I dropped my head into my hands and squeezed hard — a futile attempt to contain the chaos in my brain. Tears forced their way through closed lids, streaming hot down my cheeks. As a little girl growing up in the ’80s, one of my favorite movies was “Firestarter,” starring an 8-year-old Drew Barrymore. When enraged or overwhelmed, Barrymore’s character would start fires with her mind. I remember fearing back then that I, too, might have this power, so profound was my pain.
Now, despite decades of my own inner work, despite years of actively trying to not be ruled by the wounds of my past, I couldn’t help but to detonate at the threat of my husband leaving me.
But having a child means that even during times of disaster, natural or self-made, we must carry on. As the days passed, I attempted to blend our old life with our new one by scattering our few family photos around the apartment, helping my daughter navigate a new bus route, dealing with insurance adjusters. Yet as my husband grew increasingly more distant, I sank into a state of despair.
Loss suddenly seemed everywhere. Beyond the many dear friends who lost their homes in the Palisades and Altadena fires, beyond the decimation to our once gorgeous coastline between Santa Monica and Malibu, I thought of my daughter who would soon be off to college, of my ailing father, of my marriage. Unable to eat or sleep, I sought out help. I met with my trusted longtime therapist, emailed my spiritual teacher, road-tripped down to Orange County to visit my best friend. I also met with a grief therapist with whom I’d worked a decade earlier.
“You have some very real, very major things happening. But this isn’t just about now. What does this feeling remind you of, Evan?” she asked, her voice soft and supportive as she leaned in toward the screen separating us.
Suddenly I was no longer idling in my parked car, phone propped up on my steering wheel. I was  9 years old again, unaccompanied on an airplane somewhere above the continental U.S., being hurled between two contentiously divorced parents. As I talked through my present-day experience, I began to understand exactly what had happened between my husband and me on the day of our move; why I had lashed out so fiercely.
Lifestyle
We spent a perfect weekend in L.A. and another good one in Orange County. So what happened? Why did he ghost me? ‘I really like this woman in San Diego,’ he said.
Famed psychologist Richard Schwartz, founder of Internal Family Systems therapy, posits that our minds are made up of different sub-personalities much like a family system. He labels some of these parts our exiles — the wounded selves that hold our deepest pain. When my husband questioned our marriage, my exiles, my most fragile, fearful parts felt wildly threatened. That is when my firefighters — our most reactive, protective parts (and no, the irony is not lost on me) — stormed in to shield them unfortunately in the only way they knew how: through rage.
They weren’t trying to destroy my marriage; they were just trying to keep me from once again experiencing the anguish of being launched into the world, alone and afraid.
Every day for over a week, I knelt before a makeshift altar in my bedroom, anchored myself to my breath and performed a most Herculean feat: twice daily, hour-long meditations. Rather than resist my sadness, I allowed myself to feel it fully — even when this meant soaking my T-shirt in tears, even when it felt as though the tears would never stop.
“I can handle my life” became my new mantra.
As I began to experience the sort of clarity and calm that only meditation can bring, I had a powerful insight: I recently trained to work as a doula, supporting women through labor, reminding them that the most unfathomable pain — in life as in birth — comes just before the new version of themselves can be born.
I considered how, for days on end, I’d cried in the shower, doubled over in heartache. I can’t survive this, I’d sobbed to my best friend. You will, she insisted.
Lifestyle
It’s time to let it go and move on to my next adventure. But I know that my husband’s spirit will always be with me.
I pleaded to the universe to spare me of my suffering, to reverse time, to let me be anywhere but here.
Just like birthing mamas do in the throes of labor.
But as I was recently reminded, our agony isn’t the end of the story. It’s the threshold. And when once we emerge on the other side — and we always do no matter how unlikely our survival may seem — we emerge transformed.
After eight interminable days, it struck me: My husband was suffering just as deeply as I was.
Sitting across from him at a tiny, borrowed wooden table, I chose to tell him: “I understand now. I hear you. I’m sorry.” Suddenly, he softened. My ability to empathize enabled him to see a door where once he’d believed none had existed.
In the end, had I saved love? It’s such an amorphous, ever-evolving entity; I’m not really sure. Though I certainly hope so.
But what I do know now is that this fire hadn’t come to destroy me; it came to show me what was indestructible. It came to show me that I could, indeed, handle my life.

LAist and KCRW leaders say loss of taxpayer funds could hurt local public radio,https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2025-03-28/laist-kcrw-oppose-government-cuts,2025-03-28,"Leaders at both of Southern California’s largest public news and information radio stations said that a threat by Republicans in Washington to eliminate federal support for public broadcasting would be a serious blow to local programming.
While KCRW-FM (89.9) and LAist, which broadcasts under the call sign KPCC-FM (89.3), get the vast majority of their financial support from other sources, a loss of the government subsidy might threaten the kind of coverage exemplified in the aftermath of the Eaton and Palisades fires, executives at the two stations said in an interview.
Hollywood Inc.
The two public media entities have become frequent targets in the GOP’s efforts to reduce government spending.
The remarks came after a hearing Wednesday in Washington in which a congressional committeecriticized the heads of NPR and PBSfor what Republicans called biased coverage. The chair of the committee, Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.), vowed to end taxpayer support for the public broadcasters, which  she labeled as “communists.”
The cut would cost Pasadena-based LAist $1.7 million from its budget of $41 million, while Santa Monica-based KCRW would lose $1.3 million from a budget of $24 million, the executives said.
“We have to balance our budget every year, so we would have to make definite changes,” KCRW President Jennifer Ferro said. “We don’t want to go backward and provide less service. We want to provide more service. With this cut, we’d have to raise an additional $1.3 million just to stay where we are. You can’t just snap your fingers and do that.”
While public funding for media has been questioned many times before, Ferro said the threat felt more serious this year, because so many programs and departments simultaneously have been targeted for cutbacks by the Trump administration.
Following the Washington hearing, LAist Editor in Chief Megan Garvey sent an email to listeners defending the station’s coverage.
“We provide in-depth news, thoughtful conversations, and essential local coverage free from commercial and political influence,” Garvey’s message said. “We believe hearing viewpoints across the spectrum makes us a stronger and more informed nation.”
The station said it saw an increase in donations during a recent on-air pledge drive, in which LAist staffers repeatedly said the station needed more donations to counter a potential cut in government funding.
Earlier in March, LAist development executive Rob Risko laid out the magnitude of the threat presented by the loss of federal funds.
“That’s $1.7m of funding for LAist — or more than 13 jobs — that go directly to bringing you in-depth reporting on housing, public safety, the climate, breaking news and more,” Risko wrote to listeners. “If those dollars go away, LAist will still be here for you every day.”
But he said it would be “significantly harder” for LAist to “uncover corruption,” provide the kind of breaking news coverage demonstrated during the fires and to accomplish in-depth analysis exemplified in LAist’s election “Voter Game Plan.”
Both stations called it unfair to label their news coverage as slanted when the majority of stories focus on nonideological topics. Ferro pointed, for example, to a forum KCRW conducted on Zoom, with an audience of 3,000 people asking questions about health concerns raised by the wildfires.
“I feel it’s so important now that people can have institutions they rely on and trust,” Ferro said. “Maybe that’s a quaint idea, but we are not here just to make money off you or to market your personal data. We are trying to bring news and information for the sole purpose of educating the community.”
Also threatened by the potential cut to the Corporation for Public Broadcasting would be a roughly $11-million annual payment to support a satellite system that connects NPR stations. The satellite link helps stations deliver live news reports from anywhere in the nation.
The service would go away, unless stations could find a way to bridge the funding gap, said Ferro, who was in Washington for Wednesday’s hearing.
Stations in small and remote communities get as much as 40% of their funding from the CPB, Ferro said, making it difficult for them to stay on the air without the federal dollars.

LAFD actions in Palisades fire shrouded in secrecy as city refuses to release records,https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2025-03-27/lafd-records-secrecy,2025-03-29,"More than two and a half months after flames leveled much of  Pacific Palisades, the Los Angeles Fire Department and Mayor Karen Bass’ office have maintained an extraordinary secrecy about the city’s preparations for and response to the inferno.
The Fire Department, the mayor and her representatives have yet to provide answers to basic questions from The Times about whether they approved  the LAFD’s plan to protect the Palisades before the Jan. 7 blaze. Nor have they addressed The Times’ questions about which LAFD crews were the first to arrive at the scene.
At the same time, the LAFD has denied dozens of public records requests from journalists and others related to its handling of the fire, including 911 calls, dispatch logs and internal communications about preparations for the extreme winds.
Two former LAFD chief officers say those records should have been available for release since the early days of the fire.
Some victims of the Palisades conflagration have criticized the lack of transparency, while open government advocates say the city’s refusal to release public records runs afoul of disclosure laws.
“It’s absolutely frustrating,” said Sue Pascoe, who lost her home of 30 years in the fire and is the editor of the Palisades news website, Circling the News. “People do want answers and are getting no answers.”
Political careers could be on the line. With billions in damages, the fire is likely to be thecostliest disaster in L.A. history. Nearly 7,000 homes and other buildings were destroyed, and 12 people died. Already, a nascentrecall campaignhas targeted Bass, who is up for reelection next year. The mayor has been fiercelycriticized for traveling to Ghanathree days before the fire, despite a forecast of dangerous winds that grew increasingly dire after she left.
The silence on these questions since the fire  extended to the office of Traci Park, the City Council member who represents the Palisades. Park and her staff for weeks did not respond to several emails from The Times requesting an interview and help in obtaining information, including on matters such as the arrival of water-dropping helicopters over the fire and reasons for delays in responding to the blaze.
On Feb. 21, Bass removed Kristin Crowley as fire chief, citing Crowley’s deployment decisions before the fire as a reason. Park was one of two council members, out of 15, whovoted against Crowley’s firing, saying she could not support the dismissal before the completion of an inquiry into who was to blame for failures in the preparation for and response to the fire.
Park’s spokesperson Pete Brown said Friday that Park called for the outside inquiry of “everything related to the fire” in part because she was uncomfortable with LAFD investigating itself. He said no one had been hired yet to complete the inquiry, which he characterized as a comprehensive investigation that will cover The Times’ questions and more.
The Times reported in January that Crowley and her staffchose not to order1,000 firefighters to remain on duty for a second shift the morning of the blaze, which would have doubled the number of personnel on hand. Crowley and her fire commanders said they didn’t hold over the shift because they didn’t have enough engines for that many firefighters.
They said certain reductions in theLAFD budgetapproved by Bass and the City Council prevented the department from hiring enough mechanics to keep engines in the field. As a result, they said, 40 regular engines — one in five of the LAFD’s fleet — were out of service the day of the fire.
“We did not have enough apparatus to put them on,” Crowley told the City Council earlier this month in her bid to get her job back. “Because of the budget cuts and lack of investments in our fleet maintenance, over 100 of our fire engines, firetrucks and ambulances sat broken down in our maintenance yards, unable to be used to help during one of the worst wildfire events in our history.”
But holding over a shift allows commanders to fill emergency staffing needs without having to rely on firefighters coming in voluntarily. Those who aren’t needed are sent home with their gear in case they’re needed back in a hurry, the ex-chiefs said.
The Times found that in preparing for the winds, the department staffed up only five of more than 40 engines available — a different set of rigs from the disabled ones — to supplement the regular firefighting force. That meant there were dozens of working engines that could have been pre-positioned in the Palisades and elsewhere,as had been done in the pastduring similar weather.
Known internally as 200 Series engines, they are identical to other engines and usually paired with hook-and-ladder trucks, which do not carry water. When needed for wildfires, they carry four firefighters. The department also could have reassigned to the Palisades and other high-risk areas several more engines, in addition to the 200 Series rigs, from stations not in the fire zone, the former LAFD chief officers told The Times.
And if Crowley had kept the 1,000 firefighters on duty, they could have staffed support vehicles besides engines, such as trucks for brush patrols and “plug buggies,” which are utility pickups that could have carried supplies and relief firefighters — and performed other tasks, the former chiefs said.
As for mechanics, the number has fluctuated between 64 and 74 since 2020, according to records released by the Fire Department. As of this year, the agency had 71 mechanics.
Crowley for weeks did not respond to questions from The Times about the precise whereabouts of engines before the blaze and which engine or engines responded first, among other queries.
It took the LAFD and the city more than a month to provide The Times with routine maintenance and repair records for the disabled engines and the rest of the fleet. Those documents show that some of the engines had been out of service for many months and even years, and a few were labeled as “salvage.” The records provide no explanation for the long delays in repairing the engines, and the LAFD did not respond to specific questions about them.
California
Fire officials made the critical decision to forgo calling in scores of extra firefighters and equipment in the hours before the fire, according to internal documents reviewed by The Times.
The Times reviewed more than 150 requests for documents related to the city’s preparation for and response to the wildfire that were submitted to the LAFD under the California Public Records Act in the city’s online portal, which includes responses to the requests.
About 40 were flat out denied, with officials claiming they are precluded from disclosures because of an ongoing investigation into what caused the blaze. In some cases, they cited a catchall exemption that keeping the records private clearly outweighs the public interest, with no further explanation. Other requests were not fulfilled until well after the deadlines specified in the public records act.
The LAFD has also refused to turn over communications among commanders on deployment and staffing decisions, claiming the catchall exemption. With few exceptions, the public records act states that any written communication — including emails and text messages — related to the conduct of government is a public record.
In response to multiple requests for 911 recordings about the Palisades fire, the city said on its online portal that the investigation by the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives into the cause of the blaze “prevents information related to the fire from being disclosed at this time.”
The same exemption was cited for a records request regarding a small blaze on New Year’s Day in the Palisades that might be linked the Jan. 7 fire. Among other potential causes, the ATF is investigating whether hidden embers from the earlier fire sparked the larger blaze when the winds kicked up.
David Loy, legal director of the First Amendment Coalition, said the city does not have “a blank check” to withhold records because of an investigation into the fire. He also said that records that were public before the fire remain public regardless of a subsequent investigation.
“The public does have an overwhelming interest in knowing how the Fire Department was responding to this crisis in real time,” he said. “What possible interest is served by withholding that information? I cannot fathom, other than they just don’t want people to know.”
The Times filed a public records request on Jan. 10 for all text messages sent or received by Bass on Jan. 7 and Jan. 8 that mention fire response or her travel plans, Her office said nearly two months later that it had “no responsive messages.”
An attorney for the city said thatBass’ phone auto-deletes text messagesand argued that she was not required to retain her texts because they are “ephemeral types of electronic communication.” Bass and her attorneys later said they would search for the texts and turn over “responsive records.” Last Friday, they providedsome of Bass’ text messagesto The Times while stating that an unspecified number were “redacted and/or withheld” based on exemptions to the public records act.
The Timesfiled a lawsuit on Thursdayrequesting that a judge order the city to disclose records responsive to reporters’ requests and to preserve public records for at least two years. The lawsuit also seeks a finding that city officials unlawfully withheld or deleted the mayor’s text messages and other public records.
The Times obtained an incident log from a source showing that after the first 911 call about the fire came in at 10:29 a.m., firefighting crews took more than 18 minutes to reach the scene.
Former department officials said the LAFDcould have sent at least 10 additional enginesto the Palisades before the fire — engines that could have been on patrol along the hillsides and canyons, where crews might have spotted the fire soon after it started, when it was still small enough to give them a chance to control it.
California
The toll might not have been as bad if extra engines had been pre-positioned much closer to the most fire-prone areas, former fire chiefs said.
Only 18 firefighters are typically on duty at the two fire stations in the Palisades. Fourteen of them are routinely available to fight brush fires, while the other four are assigned to ambulances, although they might help with evacuations or rescues during fires.
Pascoe, the Palisades resident and journalist, said her requests for information about the early firefight have gone unanswered by the city.
“If you messed up, let us know,” she said. “Whatever the mistakes were, we need to know, so this never happens to anyone ever again.”
Pascoe said firefighting crews usually are pre-deployed in the Palisades on red flag days, and when a fire ignites, LAFD helicopters respond quickly. She said that didn’t happen this time.
“There seemed to be no support anywhere,” said Pascoe, who evacuated the afternoon of Jan. 7 when she saw the fire burning over the hills from her house. “We figured they’d be put out and we’d come back the next day, because we’ve done that before. … It just seems like this did not need to happen, and someone does need to be held accountable.”

Fire debris clearance: How to decide between the U.S. Army Corps and private contractors,https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2025-03-27/fire-debris-clearance-army-corps-opt-in-opt-out-right-of-entry-private-contractors-insurance,2025-03-28,"Los Angeles County property owners have until April 15 to enroll in the government-run debris clearance program for the Eaton and Palisades fires.
The owners of more than 9,600 properties — more than 70% of the properties eligible for debris clearance — have submitted paperwork to opt in to the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers program, according to thelatest data from L.A. County.
The owners of another 1,031 properties said they wereopting outand hiring private contractors. That leaves more than 2,900 homeowners who haven’t signaled which option they will choose.
“Some of my clients have been riding the deadline,” said Denise Sze, an attorney who is the president of the Pacific Coast Assn. of Public Insurance Adjusters, a trade organization for public adjusters. She said homeowners are still weighing which option would make more financial sense, in part because quotes for private debris removal have risen significantly.
Government officials and insurance experts agree: Anyone still weighing their options should submit aright-of-entry formand opt in.
Opting in to the Army Corps program isn’t binding. Homeowners can still change their minds andwithdraw laterif they want to hire a private contractor. But the Army Corps will not accept new enrollments after April 15, a two-week extension of the original deadline of March 31.
“If I wasn’t sure, I’d opt in and buy yourself some time,” said Malibu Mayor Doug Stewart.

The Army Corps has said its engineers and contractors will walk through the property with the homeowner before starting the debris clearance, but that generally, crews remove almost everything in what’s called the “ash footprint,” or the area where burned debris settled after the fire.
That includes any structures left standing, such as walls and chimneys, as well as burned appliances and cars. Crews may also remove some hardscaping, such as sidewalk pavers and driveway segments, where ash and debris fell.
Homeowners can ask the Army Corps to remove their foundations. Experts generally recommend having the foundation taken out because high temperatures can weaken concrete, and because older foundations may not be approved during the rebuilding process because building codes have changed.
The corps will scrape off up to six inches of soil from the burn area, butwill not provide soil testing.
Army Corps crews will cut down trees that have died or are at risk of dying in the next five years, butwill not remove the stumps. Homeowners cansubmit a waiverto keep trees, but must acknowledge that leaving them standing “may impact my ability to obtain a permit or rebuild.”
Retaining walls that are needed to stabilize the property or the neighborhood also won’t be removed, posing a financial problem for some homeowners whose insurance does not cover them.
The Army Corps crews will not remove pools, most driveways, and patios or sidewalks that are outside the ash footprint.
Homeowners are not supposed to pay out of pocket for the government cleanup.
Those who submit aright-of-entry formmust include their insurance information. Los Angeles County will eventually work to recoup any money left in a homeowner’s insurance policy for debris removal.
If the cost of cleaning up a property exceeds the policyholder’s debris removal coverage, the owner would “not be liable for any further costs,” Ricardo Lara, California’s insurance commissioner, told insurers in amemo in January.
Many homeowners can’t afford private debris clearance because they just don’t have enough debris removal coverage in their insurance policies. But for those who have higher coverage limits, Sze said, private contractors can offer more flexibility.
“It will be a more precise experience,” Sze said. “There’s a certain modicum of control you’re going to have if you do it yourself.”
Sze said homeowners are wavering on private options because quotes are rising rapidly. She said that’s in part because private contractors are paying extra fees to dispose of fire debris that contain toxins.
Private clearance also makes sense for some homeowners with more unusual requests. Sze said she had one client in the Palisades who is asking his contractors to search through the remains of his home for precious metals, which would still retain some value, even if melted.
Properties are already being cleared by the Army Corps and by private companies.
The Army Corps istracking its progress online. As of Friday,  949 homes have been cleared, up from 906 on Thursday and 856 on Wednesday. That pace is expected to pick up as more crews join the cleanup effort. The Army Corps expects to clear 3,000 properties by the end of May.
The Army Corps is not clearing properties in the order that homeowners sign up, but is instead trying to group nearby properties together. Officials have encouraged homeowners to work with their neighbors to sign everyone up together.
Los Angeles County Supervisor Lindsey Horvath pointed to a stretch of 60 homes along the beach in Malibu, where every property owner notified the county about their plans to opt in or opt out.
The Army Corps scheduled debris clearance for all the homes at the same time, and installed K rail to block off a lane of the Pacific Coast Highway, allowing debris trucks and heavy equipment to access the properties without blocking traffic.
Some types of multifamily housing, including most condo buildings, are now eligible for the Army Corps cleanup. The Federal Emergency Management Administrationbroadened the eligibility requirementsat the end of March.
Any residential property with at least one owner-occupied unit is eligible for the federal cleanup, said Robert Fenton, FEMA’s Region 9 administrator, in aletterto Gov. Gavin Newsom’s Office of Emergency Services.
In order for duplexes, townhomes and condos to be considered, county officials must receivea right-of-entry formfrom every owner of a destroyed unit, as well as from the homeowners association, FEMA said.
Buildings that are entirely rented out to tenants are generally not eligible for the federal debris cleanup program. FEMA said that those apartment building owners are expected to “use their insurance and hire a licensed contractor to conduct debris removal.”
Apartment building owners can still apply for the Army Corps’ cleanup, but their eligibility will be determined on a case-by-case basis, Fenton said. Those property owners would need to include a justification for using federal funds on their cleanup, Fenton said. That could include the debris on the property posing an immediate threat to public health and safety, or the removal of the debris having an economic impact on the community.
Los Angeles County Supervisor Linsdey Horvath, whose Westside district includes Malibu and the Palisades, said the county is continuing to advocate for the inclusion of nonprofits, churches, mobile home parks and commercial properties in the federal debris clearance program.
Anyone who is not sure whether their property is eligible should submit a right-of-entry form, county officials say.

"L.A. County soil testing near Eaton, Palisades fires shows significant contamination",https://www.latimes.com/environment/story/2025-04-11/soil-testing-eaton-palisades-fires-significant-contamination,2025-04-11,"After months of questions in the aftermath of the Eaton and Palisades fires, the Los Angeles County Department of Public Health has finally sharedpreliminary resultsfrom soil testing in and around the burn areas. The publicly available data are still somewhat vague — but they do show concerning levels of lead on properties downwind of the Eaton fire, as well as isolated “hot spots” of contamination in the Palisades.
The results were revealed during avirtual community meetingThursday evening and offer the first glimpse at the lasting fallout from January’s devastating firestorm.
Roux Associates, a private testing firm hired by the county, collected samples from 780 properties in both burn zones over four weeks from mid-February to mid-March. It analyzed those samples for 14 toxic substances  commonly found in the wake of wildfires, including heavy metals such as arsenic and lead; polyaromatic hydrocarbons such as anthracene and napthalene; and dioxins.
The first batch of results — the county said more data are forthcoming — focused on intact properties that were left standing after the fire, and found that as much as 80% of soil samples collected downwind of the Eaton burn scar had levels above the state health standard of 80 milligrams of lead per kilogram of soil. Results for parcels of land with damaged and destroyed properties are still pending.
The findings around lead are “really where we did see something that stood out,” said Adam Love, Roux’s vice president and principal scientist. “We saw much higher percentages of exceedance of the screening levels in the areas that were immediately downwind of where the main houses burned in the Eaton fire.”
Around 36% of parcels within the Eaton burn scar exceeded the state limit for lead, the results show. Far more, 47%, exceeded it in areas just beyond that boundary. In the area southwest of Eaton fire zone, between 70% and 80% exceeded the lead levels.
Climate & Environment
In the wake of the Eaton and Palisades fires, Army Corps officials are saying that excavating six inches of topsoil is enough to rid properties of contamination.
The findings revealed Thursday did not include specific values or parcel-level results for the still-intact homes, but they did show the share of properties tested in the area that exceeded California’s health limit for lead and other chemicals. Virtually all tested parcels were homes, although a few of those tested outside the burn area were public spaces, Love said.
Love noted that it is typical for urban areas to have higher levels of lead than the overall state limit — especially places near highways where cars used to burn leaded gasoline. What’s more, Altadena was home to a large number of buildings that probably contained lead paint, with one report from CalTech indicating that more than 90% of houses in the area were built prior to 1975, three years before the paint was banned.
But the high number of properties on which lead was detected at levels exceeding health standards suggests that decades-old paint alone may not fully account for the toxicity, Love said. At least some of that is likely to have come from the fire and its smoke.
Lead is a heavy metal that is linked to serious health problems including damage to the brain and nervous system, as well as digestive, reproductive and cardiovascular issues, according to theEnvironmental Protection Agency. Children, elderly and pregnant people are particularly sensitive to the chemical.
Exceeding screening thresholds does not automatically mean cleanup is necessary, but rather that additional evaluation should be considered, county officials said.
Climate & Environment
FEMA is doubling down on its decision to not test soil after cleanup of toxic wildfire ash and debris in Los Angeles County, despite public outrage.
On the other side of the county, the Palisades fire burn zone generally fared better as there was no evidence of widespread contamination, officials said.
However, the Palisades tests did reveal what Love called isolated “hot spots” of heavy metals and polyaromatic hydrocarbons.
Among those heavy metals was arsenic, a known carcinogen. The worst results were found on properties just outside the fire boundary, where nearly 26% of the parcels showed arsenic levels above 12 milligrams per kilogram, the “background level” established by Roux and based on a high-end estimate of what naturally occurs in Southern California soil.
“Whereas with Eaton, the arsenic was evenly distributed, in Palisades, we see sort of a hot spot up in the ... northeast section of the Palisades area,” Love said.
The source of the contaminants in those areas was not immediately clear, as they are not consistent with fire-related smoke plumes, he said.
Nichole Quick, chief medical adviser with the L.A. County Department of Public Health, said officials are requesting federal and state partners to help further assess the Palisades hot spots, and are coordinating with the county to explore options for more targeted lead testing in affected areas downwind of the Eaton fire.
All of this followsreports from The Timesthat federal officials opted to break from their nearly two-decade tradition of testing soil on destroyed properties that have been cleaned by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. The Army Corps in the past would first scrape 6 inches of topsoil, and then test the ground underneath; if those tests revealed toxins still on the property, it would scrape further.
Indeed, in the past, such testing has proved essential. After the devastating Camp fire in Paradise in 2018, soil testing of 12,500 properties revealed that nearly one-third still contained dangerous levels of contaminants even after the first 6 inches of topsoil were scraped by federal crews.
Crews had to return to some of those properties as many as five times to remove more soil before they were deemed safe and clear.
In this case, however, the agency that typically oversees that work — the Federal Emergency Management Agency — insteadsaid removing 6 inches without further testing will be enough, citing at various times costs, efficiency and policy changes as their justification.
L.A. County ordered the testing from Roux in lieu of that federal testing. So far, the county has announced results only from standing homes, which are not eligible for cleanup from the Army Corps of Engineers.
The results of soil testing from scraped properties are still pending, Love said. A final report and analysis will be available in May.
Many residents and public officials were frustrated with FEMA’s decision to abstain from testing in the wake of the fires, with the state’s Office of Emergency Services director Nancy Wardcalling on the federal agency to reconsider.
“Without adequate soil testing, contaminants caused by the fire can remain undetected, posing risks to returning residents, construction workers, and the environment,” Ward wrote in a February letter to the agency. “Failing to identify and remediate these fire-related contaminants may expose individuals to residual substances during rebuilding efforts and potentially jeopardize groundwater and surface water quality.”
Climate & Environment
California officials say state data have shown that wildfire contamination can extend deeper than 6 inches, contradicting FEMA’s claims.
Officials in Los Angeles said residents with concerns about their specific properties may want to consult environmental professionals for evaluation.
“In all areas with ongoing fire debris, residents are reminded to take precautions to not inhale, ingest or come into contact with ash, soot, and/or fire debris by using appropriate personal protective equipment,” the Department of Public Health wrote in asummary report of its findings. “Additionally, community members are encouraged to review the soil sampling results and consider taking appropriate precautions if your home is in one of the areas where soil sample screening thresholds have been exceeded.”
The county is also offering free lead blood-level screening for anyone impacted by the fires and concerned about exposure.

Edison to bury more than 150 miles of power lines in wake of devastating L.A. County firestorms,https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2025-04-11/edison-to-bury-power-lines-in-wake-of-firestorms,2025-04-11,"More than 150 miles of electrical power lines damaged by the Palisades and Eaton fires in Malibu and Altadena are slated to be replaced with underground lines,Southern California Edisonannounced Friday. The years-long project would reduce the future risk of wildfire in the devastated communities, officials said.
The company’s plan would target areas at higher risk of wildfires, with about 130 circuit miles of underground distribution lines being placed in high-fire-risk areas.
“SCE’s initial rebuilding plan will underground electrical distribution infrastructure where practical and make the most of breakthrough technologies to reduce wildfire risk,” said Pedro Pizarro, CEO of Edison International, SCE’s parent company.
The project is expected to cost at least $860 million and could take years to complete, but officials said the plan would reduce the risk of wildfires in the area as well as the need for emergency power shutdowns during extreme weather events.
“SCE will build back a resilient, reliable grid for our customers,” said Southern California Edison CEO Steven Powell.
California
Southern California Edison changed how crews ground idle transmission towers just days after the Eaton fire, but they won’t say what was changed.
In Altadena, the underground lines would account for about half of the city’s distribution lines, he said.
“It’s pretty significant,” Pizarro said in an interview.
Edison’s plan comes after Gov. Gavin Newsom in Marchsuspended key environmental lawsfor utility companies to rebuild infrastructure that was damaged and destroyed during the  fires.
The order eliminated the need for  companies to comply with the California Environmental Quality Act and the California Coastal Act, and it encouraged utilities to build underground equipment where possible.
Pizarro said the order helped Southern California Edison develop the plan for the underground lines, speeding the pathway to get the work underway.
“Those are areas that have been pretty significantly destroyed, and our hearts are broken for them,” he said.
In a plan sent to Newsom’s office Friday, Edison’s preliminary draft calls for a total of 153 circuit miles to be installed underground.
In Altadena, about 40 circuit miles of power line would be replaced underground in neighborhoods that have been determined to behigh-fire-risk areas. Another 23 circuit miles would be installed in neighboring areas.
In Malibu, 90 circuit miles would be constructed in the city.
Edison also is reviewing adding another 19 miles to the project in Altadena.
In all, the project is expected to cost somewhere between $860 million and $925 million.
Some of the areas could be completed within months, but others could take years. Pizarro said much of it depends on the community’s rebuilding plans, the needs that arise as reconstruction projects get underway, and the permitting process.
“We’re working closely with state and county leaders and the communities of Altadena and Malibu to rebuild wildfire-impacted area stronger than ever,” Pizarro said.
The plan is a significant project to Edison, which was already requesting approval for projects to place about 600 miles of lines underground by 2028.
Currently, the company has about 17,000 miles of distribution circuits in high fire risk areas, and about 7,000 miles of those are underground.
The plan was drafted after more than 50 meetings with community members, and will include upgrades to the grid design in anticipation of increasing demand.
“There’s a lot of interest in the community to do underground lines,” Pizarro said.
Lines that are not placed underground will be hardened and covered with insulation.
Climate & Environment
Cal Fire added at least 2.8 million Californians to fire hazard zones. Here’s how to check which zone you’re in and what that means.
Although the cost of the plan could near a billion dollars, officials said SCE was looking  to work with local, state and federal officials to find  ways to fund the project so that it doesn’t translate to increased rates.
“This is a lot of cost to the customer, so we’re looking at either federal, state or philanthropic options to lower the cost,” Pizarro said.
The company also is looking for ways to fund other direct costs for customers, he said. For example, connecting homes to the grid can cost the individual customer $8,000 to $10,000, he said.
“We really want to find a way to avoid that being a cost that these communities have to pick up,” he said.
Some of those costs might be diverted through grants and other projects with state or local officials, he said.
The current plan would only include distribution lines, which are the electrical wires that carry electricity from the grid into homes and businesses. Transmission lines, which carry a larger amount of electricity through regions, are not included in the plan.
Although speculation about what sparked the Eaton fire has centered on the area near three transmission towers in Eaton Canyon, Pizarro said the risk of electrical equipment sparking a wildfire is higher with distribution equipment.
The company has explored the possibility of placing transmission lines underground but said doing so is less feasible because of factors such as the amount of electricity of the lines; rougher, steeper terrain; and higher costs.

California Sen. Padilla hopes Fix Our Forests Act will prevent more L.A. fires,https://www.latimes.com/politics/story/2025-04-11/padilla-hopes-fix-our-forests-act-will-prevent-more-la-fires,2025-04-11,"WASHINGTON —Months afterwildfires ravaged Los Angeles County, California Sen. Alex Padilla is hoping his bill to overhaul forest management and prevent wildfires might be the first bipartisan measure for President Trump to sign.
“I don’t think anything could completely prevent wildfires, but through this work, if we can prevent just one more community from experiencing the heartbreak felt by the families in Santa Rosa or in Paradise or the Pacific Palisades and Altadena, then this effort would’ve been worth it,” Padilla said Thursday.
Padilla, who chairs the Senate Wildfire Caucus, joined with a bipartisan group of senators from the West — Sens. John Curtis (R-Utah), John Hickenlooper (D-Colo.) and Tim Sheehy (R-Mont.) — to introduce the Fix Our Forests Act, which mirrors a bipartisan measure of the same name thatthe House passedin January.
The Fix Our Forests Act would usher in sweeping changes to how the federal government manages its land — which constitutes 45% of the uninhabited, wildfire-prone land in California, according tothe Congressional Research Service. It would create a wildfire intelligence center to centralize federal management, require assessments of fireshed areas and streamline how communities reduce their wildfire risk. It also would ramp up research into wildfire mitigation technologies and change some forestation treatments.
‘I know of no other mayor of Los Angeles — and I have followed closely the careers of six — who can match her experience in state and national government, where she served with distinction as speaker of the California state Assembly and Congress member of the United States.’
Although the House handily passed the measure, it was not completely welcome among environmental groups. Dozenswrote a letterdecrying the measure for rolling back protections for endangered species and removing accountability against “extractive industries.”
“Gutting wildlife protections and community input on managing our public lands have never made forests healthier or reduced wildfire risk, and that won’t change with this legislation,” Ashley Nunes, public lands policy specialist at the Center for Biological Diversity, said in a statement Thursday. “Not a single community will be safer from wildfires if this becomes law.”
Padilla argued that his bill improved upon issues brought by those groups, including adding a provision for prescribed burns, “building on the expertise and experience of Native American tribes that have been implementing prescribed fires for generations.”
The Senate version also redefined projects eligible for grants, “to make sure that the L.A. would be eligible right now,” said Matt Weiner, chief executive and founder of the advocacy organization Megafire Action, which pushed for the legislation.
“I think it’s pretty crazy, frankly, that we’re on the cusp of getting to the president’s desk here a bill that he could sign into law that would be bipartisan and one of the most comprehensive rewrites of federal wildfire policy in decades,” Weiner said. “Amid all the chaos, there’s an opportunity to do something really meaningful here in a bipartisan way.”
The legislation started with an airplane conversation between Democratic Rep. Scott Peters of San Diego and his Republican colleague Rep. Bruce Westerman of Arkansas. The two were traveling together on an international congressional trip, when Westerman sat beside Peters and asked if he could tell him a story about California’s sequoias.
“He couldn’t get away,” Westerman said with a laugh. As a licensed forester, Westerman wanted to overhaul federal forest management. Peters, an environmental lawyer by trade who came to Congress to push climate solutions, was “interested because it’s California.”
Travel & Experiences
Trails in both the San Gabriel and Santa Monica Mountains were closed in January because of the Eaton and Palisades fires. In recent weeks, a portion of them were opened to the public again.
“The people in the 1970s who drew up our environmental laws were meeting the challenges of those days,” Peters said in January. “Time is our enemy. ... The longer we wait, the more we have these catastrophic fires. And I just think that environmental groups haven’t caught up with that, some of them.”
A previous version of the bill passed the House but was not taken up for a vote in the Senate. Westerman and Petersreintroduced it in Januaryon the heels of the L.A. fires, hoping they could capture their colleagues’ attention.
“The great thing about this bill is we can do something outside of disaster,” Westerman said at the time. “This is about preventing future disasters.”
California’s leaders — including Gov. Gavin Newsom and Cal Fire Chief Joe Tyler — applauded the Senate version of the bill. Newsom pointed to his own efforts temporarily lifting state regulations to speed up rebuilding in the wake of the L.A. fires.
“The Fix Our Forest Act is a step forward that will build on this progress — enabling good projects to happen faster on federal lands,” Newsom said in a statement.

Ten victims of the Jan. 7 fires sue the California Fair Plan over smoke damages,https://www.latimes.com/business/story/2025-04-10/ten-victims-of-the-jan-7-fires-file-lawsuit-against-the-fair-plan-over-smoke-damages,2025-04-11,"Kathleen Jordan, her husband and young daughter, consider themselves fortunate. They not only managed to flee to safety from the Eaton fire, but the family’s Altadena home somehow escaped the flames, even though their chicken coop and detached storage units burned, like many homes on their street.
But three months after the fire, Jordan says the family isn’t  close to moving back. And she blames one entity for that: the California Fair Plan, the state’s insurer of last resort.
Jordan says a door at their East Loma Alta Drive home swung open during the firestorm and the interior was coated with debris. Yet, she says, the Fair Plan has  failed to properly investigate or pay for any remediation of the soot, ash and smoke damage.
“We sort of celebrated thinking that we we were in this really lucky group of people, only to find out later that that is not at all the case,” said Jordan, 36, who is diabetic and pregnant. “It’s a full-time job, chasing them down, emailing, calling, trying to get communication from them — and their  lack of paying what we’re owed. It’s incredibly frustrating and just maddening.”
Business
California’s Fair Plan, the state’s insurer of last resort, may be unable to pay billions in claims arising from the Los Angeles fires and may require a bailout that could ultimately be paid by homeowners statewide.
Jordan and her husband, Stephen Unckles, are among 10 victims of the Eaton and Palisades fires who are plaintiffs in a Los Angeles County Superior Court lawsuit filed Thursday against the Fair Plan.
It’s the first mass tort case against the plan that has arisen out of the Jan. 7 fires, though the insurer has faced litigation in Los Angeles and elsewhere in California over smoke damage claims.
The lawsuit accuses theLos Angeles-based planof insurance bad faith and breach of contract through its refusal to properly investigate and pay for the cleanups as required by state law, even though “wildfire smoke had transformed their homes into toxic traps, with each room and surface caked with invisible, hazardous chemical residue.”
Also named as defendants are 10 large California home insurers, which operate the Fair Plan along with other licensed state home insurers as a means or providing insurance to property owners who can’t get coverage from regular carriers.
“We have already heard from hundreds of people who are facing denials and underpayments from the Fair Plan for the massive contamination in their home caused by these wildfires,” said attorney J. Eli Wade-Scott, global managing partner at Edelson in Chicago, which is representing the families.
Among the the named defendants are Mercury, Farmers, AAA and State Farm, the state’s largest home insurer, which has beenaccused of being stingy itselfabout how it handles Jan. 7 smoke damage claims.
Hilary McLean, a spokesperson for the Fair Plan, declined comment on the lawsuit, but said in an email that the insurer “pays all covered claims, including smoke claims, consistent with California law and its policy forms, which are approved by the California Department of Insurance.”
She added: “Our policy and approach to direct physical loss is consistent with other insurers. Our policy, like many others, requires direct physical loss for there to be coverage.”
A spokesperson for the Automobile Club of Southern California declined to comment. The other insurers did not respond to requests  for comment.
Rex Frazier, president of thePersonal Insurance Federation of California, which represents major property and casualty insurers, said the lawsuit represents a “bona fide dispute” over Fair Plan policy language regarding smoke damage.
Business
The California FAIR Plan, the insurer of last resort, received approval to assess member carriers $1 billion to help pay its L.A. fire losses -- with consumers possibly on the hook for nearly half.
“However, we are unaware of any [California Department of Insurance] regulations outlining the standards for smoke claims,” he wrote in an email. “There are different views on what is a compensable smoke claim and there are no state standards. We are unaware of any external scientific consensus on this.”
The fires have alreadyspawned numerous lawsuits, including against Southern California Edison, which has acknowledged that its power lines in Eaton Canyon may have started the conflagration that destroyed more than 9,000 homes andkilled 18 people. The Los Angeles Department of Water and Poweralso has been suedfor its alleged role in causing the Palisades fire.
The Fair Plan has grown dramatically over the last several years as other insurers have pulled out of fire-prone areas across the state.
In February, the plan received approval from Insurance Commissioner Ricardo Lara toassess its member companies $1 billionto help pay its Jan. 7 fire claims — with consumers possibly on the hook for nearly half of that under a new department policy. The plan estimates losses of roughly $4 billion from the fires.
California
The largest home insurer in California seeks approval of a 22% emergency rate hike even as it faces complaints over its handling of insurance claims.
The Fair Plan was sued in Los Angeles County Superior Court on April 2 by an Altadena woman with similar complaints about her smoke-damaged home, who alleges she was advised by the insurer to just “pick up a broom and sweep.”
The latest lawsuit alleges that as the Fair Plan’s policyholder base increased over the past decade, it sought in 2016 to limit its financial exposure to claims by executing a “deliberate scheme” to insert illegal coverage restrictions in its policies.
Specifically, it redefined “direct physical loss” as requiring “actual loss or physical damage, as evidenced by permanent physical changes” to a property — and then allegedly assured the insurance department that the definition would result in no change in coverage or possibly even more. After the new approved policies were issued in 2017, the lawsuit alleges the Fair Plan “began systematically denying wildfire smoke damage claims,” citing the new policy language.
After a series of devastating fires, including the 2018 Camp fire that destroyed the town of Paradise in Northern California, the insurance department in January 2021 notified the Fair Plan that this practice was illegal, but the insurer “ignored” the directives, the lawsuit asserts, prompting regulators to conduct a “market conduct” exam of the Fair Plan, according to the lawsuit.
California
The Pasadena Unified School District has filed a lawsuit against Southern California Edison seeking damages for the loss of school buildings and the costs of managing its response to the Eaton fire.
That exam, cited in the lawsuit and reviewed by The Times,found 418 violationsof the California Insurance Code and the California Code of Regulations from January 2017 through March 18, 2021. It said the Fair Plan issued a fire policy that did not meet state standards and failed to “conduct and diligently pursue a thorough, fair and objective investigation.”
Similar  allegations  have spurred several lawsuits across California, including cases filed in Los Angeles in 2021, in Alameda County last year and in Butte County last month.
The 2021 case was a proposed class action led by a resident of Mono County whose home was damaged by soot, smoke and debris in the 2020 Mountain View fire. He alleged the Fair Plan failed to properly restore his home in the ongoing case, which was denied class action status.
“If the Department of Insurance had done in 2022 what we hoped it would do, which is to fix this problem, we don’t believe these lawsuits would be necessary,” said attorney Dylan Schaffer, who brought all three cases and is working with Edelson.
Laraissued a bulletinlast month reminding insurers — and specifically naming the Fair Plan — that they must “handle smoke damage claims in compliance with all applicable laws, regulations, and best practices for remediation of smoke damage.”
Schaffer said the bulletin was only advisory.
Michael Soller, a spokesman for Lara, declined to comment on the lawsuit but said the commissioner expects the Fair Plan “to process and pay all claims, including all smoke claims, in line with industry standards and in compliance with all laws.”

These 34 hikes and picnic sites are reopening after the L.A. fires,https://www.latimes.com/travel/newsletter/2025-04-10/the-wild-los-angeles-hiking-trails-reopening-after-eaton-palisades-fires-the-wild,2025-04-10,"Just over three months after the Eaton and Palisades fires ordered their closure, several trails have reopened throughout the San Gabriel and Santa Monica Mountains. Additionally, officials appear poised to reopen trails closed by the September 2024wildfires, including those in San Bernardino National Forest.
The reopened hikes (listed below) steer clear of the burn scars, although charred landscape may be visible from some vantage points along trails. Officials close trails for a number of reasons, including because of their proximity to a fire or its expected path, because they want roads clear to ensure safety of firefighters or because they’re worried that visitors might unwittingly start another wildfire when resources are already strapped. It’ll take months, if not years, for some of the trails burned in the recent wildfires to reopen.

I actually cheered when I saw my favorite hike had reopened, the western end of the Gabrielino trail near Pasadena. Grateful to be back, I hiked a mile Monday and found a picnic table under the shade of an oak grove. I laid down on it, put my hat over my face and listened to the conversations around me. A raven was giving someone an  earful. I closed my eyes and heard a quick few whooshes above me, like a sword cutting through the air. I looked up to see two of them flying at and around each other.
I then turned my attention to a number of canyon wrens in a debate aboutsomething. I started laughing, feeling a little silly about it, but I couldn’t help myself. A western flycatcher, bushtit, oak titmouse and orange-crowned warbler, per mybirding app, jumped into that afternoon’s discussion too.
I’ve been to this trail numerous times, but I’d never stopped at this table. One thing the January fires taught me was to slow down and appreciate what’s around us. Too often, I charge down the path with my dog Maggie May in a rush to the summit, pausing only to catch my breath and continue on.
Below you’ll find a list of all the spots we can enjoy again. I encourage you as you return to take a moment, or multiple, and engage your senses. Ask yourself: “In this moment, what do I see, feel, hear, smell and taste?” Grounding ourselves in nature is a way to remind ourselves that it’s also the journey, not just the destination, that matters.
Outside of the closures from the Eaton and Palisades fires, several trails remain closed because of the Bridge, Line and Airport fires, which burned thousands of acres through Angeles, San Bernardino and Cleveland national forests. The Holy Jim area in Cleveland National Forest, a popular hiking spot with a waterfall, remains closed, along withseveralother paths.
The closure order for the Line fire, which burned almost 44,000 acres in San Bernardino County, expired March 31. A worker at San Bernardino National Forest told me that the order is being extended through September, but it hasn’t been posted yet. It will be a smaller closure order, meaning some trails will reopen. I will let you know as I learn more!
Reopened trails and picnic areas in Angeles National Forest:
Here is alistof the trails that remain closed because of the Eaton fire. Here’s alistof what remains closed because of the Bridge fire.
Please note: Several of these openings aren’t yet reflected on the Angeles National Forest website. Thousands of workers from the U.S. Forest Service have beenfired, so please have patience with our public servants. They’re doing their best.
Reopened trails in the Santa Monica Mountains:

Last week, U.S. Secretary of Agriculture Brooke L. Rollinsissueda memo declaring a state of emergency that would allow officials to forego the usual approval process to increase logging in millions of acres of public land. A map released with the memo shows millions of acres of California included, including whatappearsto be Angeles National Forest, Los Padres National Forest, San Bernardino National Forest and Cleveland National Forest. The move was immediately decried by environmental groups,reportedJanet Wilson, senior environment reporter at the Desert Sun. “Unleashing the bulldozers and chainsaws on these beautiful public lands will result in clearcuts, polluted streams and extinct species,” said Randi Spivak, public lands policy director for the Center for Biological Diversity. “It’s well known that heavily logged forests are the most flammable. We will use every legal tool at our disposal to halt the Trump administration’s implementation of this order.”
I will keep you posted.
Happy adventuring,
As more trails reopen, it’s crucial for hikers to know what poodle-dog bush looks like. No, not because of its beauty (although its purple flowers are nice enough). The native plant often sprouts up after fire, as my colleague Lila Seidmanrecently wrote, and can cause a rash similar (and sometimes worse) to poison ivy or oak. I see it often while hiking in the San Gabriel Mountains in recently burned areas. I personally struggle, though, to distinguish between poodle-dog bush andyerba santa(which isn’t harmful to the skin). If anyone has a clever mnemonic or other means of remembering the differences, please help your local outdoors reporter out!

California should move faster on clean energy. Some lawmakers want to take a break,https://www.latimes.com/environment/newsletter/2025-04-10/california-should-move-faster-on-clean-energy-some-lawmakers-want-to-take-a-break-boiling-point,2025-04-10,"Assembly Speaker Robert Rivas, one of the most powerful people in Sacramento, just rammed a bill through his chamber that would place a six-year pause on new clean energy rules for homes in California, a few months after Los Angeles County was devastated by ferocious wildfires that demonstrated the urgency of climate change.
The Hollister Democrat says he’s not trying to stop progress on confronting the climate crisis. He’s trying to make housing less expensive, a top priority for Californians burdened by the state’s high costs.

But his legislation,AB 306, has alarmed climate activists, appliance manufacturers and labor unions.
They say the bill, if approved by the Senate and signed by Gov. Gavin Newsom, would bring to a screeching halt one of California’s best tools for reducing heat-trapping emissions and local air pollution. It would stop state and local officials from approving most new building standards, including energy-efficiency requirements and codes encouraging electric appliances, until June 1, 2031.
In aletter this week, environmental groups — including the Natural Resources Defense Council, Earthjustice and Sierra Club California — said they were “concerned about the message sent to the rest of the country and the rest of the world that halting code development is somehow an appropriate response to the Los Angeles fires.”
“We cannot ignore the signal a bill like this would broadcast in the current political climate,” they wrote, referring to President Trump’s efforts toroll back climate regulationsandpromote planet-warming fossil fuels.
Since the 1970s, California’s efficiency codes for buildings and appliances have served as a global model. They’ve also saved Californians more than $100 billion on their utility bills,according to the state Energy Commission.
Recently, state officials have started encouraging home builders and families to switch from gas space and water heaters to electric alternatives called heat pumps. Heat pumps are not only more efficient, leading to lower utility bills, they also don’t release heat-trapping emissions — orunhealthy, smog-forming nitrogen oxide pollution.
But if AB 306 becomes law, the Energy Commission would be barred from even considering code updates for six years. That’s a veritable eternity for a state that wants to be a global climate leader, especially when scientists are urging humanity to slash carbon emissionsmore than 40% by 2030— a goal California isnot on trackto meet.
Because the Energy Commission updates the building code every three years, the bill’s approval would mean that no new code would take effect until 2035, after an update already scheduled to take effect next year.
AB 306 would affect existing homes in addition to new construction. Most problematic for some climate activists, the bill would prohibit cities and counties from adopting  “reach codes” that go beyond statewide standards by encouraging families to replace broken air conditioning units with electric heat pumps capable of both cooling and heating. That way, when your gas furnace eventually breaks, there’sno need to replace it.
Andy Shrader, who served as policy director for former L.A. City Councilmember Paul Koretz, said AB 306 would “hamstring the ability of [cities] to innovate via their building codes — this at a time when innovation is essential to address the multiple and complex existential crises facing us all,” including climate change and Trump.
“We absolutely must get methane gas out of homes and businesses to make them safer,” he told lawmakers last month at ahearingof the Assembly’s Housing and Community Development Committee.
Several lawmakers on the committee expressed reservations about AB 306.
Assemblymember Ash Kalra (D-San José), whose strong climate track record has earned him a spot in California Environmental Voters’Hall of Fame, said he had “some heartburn” about the bill — especially the idea of delaying updated statewide building codes for nearly a decade. Assemblymember Lori Wilson (D-Suisun City) said she was “slightly concerned” about limiting the ability of local governments to set their own building standards.
But ultimately, all the concerned lawmakers voted “yes” — as did everyone else on the committee, and everyone who weighed in on a second committee. The bill sailed through the Assembly last week on a 71-0 floor vote.
I reached out to a few lawmakers in California Environmental Voters’ Hall of Fame to ask about why they hadn’t opposed the legislation. I didn’t hear back from spokespeople for Assemblymember Isaac Bryan (D-Los Angeles), who voted “yes,” or Assemblymember Rick Chavez Zbur (D-Los Angeles), who didn’t record a vote.
I did get an email from a spokesperson for Assemblymember Al Muratsuchi (D-Rolling Hills Estates).
“I’m sorry but he will not be able to contribute to the story,” she said.
Clearly, passing AB 306 was a priority for Rivas. The question is, why?
The answer is the housing crisis, according to the Assembly speaker’s office.
It’s no secret that homes in California are inshort supplyandincreasingly unaffordable, prompting many people toleave or consider leaving the state. For Rivas, it seems anything that might drive up the cost of building a new home or replacing an appliance — even an efficiency code that would save a homeowner or renter thousands of dollars in the long run by reducing their utility bill — is an obstacle that Californians can’t afford right now.
“The larger goal is to address the statewide housing crisis by accelerating production of supply to improve overall affordability,” Nick Miller, Rivas’ director of communications, said in an email.
“Our already strong climate goals will remain on the books,” he added.
But shouldn’t California be doing more on climate, not standing pat? When I asked Miller whether the state can really afford a six-year break from new building codes given the fires, storms and heat waves of the climate crisis, he emphasized the progress the state has already made — including the building code update scheduled to take effect next year, which will incentivize heat pumps for space and water heating in new homes.
“If building with electric is cheaper, then people should do it,” Miller said.
Fair enough. But for home builders, contractors and consumers, old habits are hard to break — hence the value of efficiency standards that encourage people to ditch gas. Building codes also help bring down the costs of new technologies — electric heat pumps, for instance — by spurring widespread adoption.
It’s also not clear if pausing building codes would make housing much cheaper.
The California Building Industry Assn. believes it would. The trade group, which supports AB 306, has estimated the statewide building code taking effect next year will add $2,500 to the cost of a new home. Additional electric-appliance rules could raise prices even more, according to Chris Ochoa, a senior counsel at the trade group.
“We have to balance electrification with affordability,” he said.
It’s a reasonable argument. But it’s not clear whether it holds up.
The Energy Commission, for instance, estimates that next year’s building code update will add just $757 to the cost of a new home. There are alsoheat pump rebatesfor replacing appliances in existing homes, to help lower-income families afford a technology that’s more expensive upfront but will save them money in the long run.
Merrian Borgeson, a California policy director at the Natural Resources Defense Council, said she thinks there’s “generally positive intent” behind AB 306. But she doesn’t think the bill would help create more housing.
“The solution they’re proposing doesn’t address any of the problems they’re raising,” she said.
It’s not just environmentalists sounding the alarm. A long list of trade groups, including the American Chemistry Council, the National Electrical Manufacturers Assn. and the Earthquake Engineering Research Institute, signed aletterraising concerns about the structural safety of buildings, among other issues with the bill.
Also opposed: the State Assn. of Electrical Workers, the State Pipe Trades Council and the Western States Council of Sheet Metal Workers, labor groups whose members construct and upgrade homes. Scott Wetch, aninfluential lobbyistfor those groups,wrotethat AB 306 would “set back decarbonization, energy efficiency, water efficiency, green building technology and modernization of the codes for almost a decade.”
In the face of so much opposition, it’s no wonder Rivas has framed AB 306 as a response to the L.A. wildfires.
To be clear, Rivas’ spokesperson insisted to me that it’s not primarily a fire relief bill. But when Rivasannounced it in January, it was part of a package of bills headlined, “Legislation Announced to Help Fire Victims.”
And before the Assembly voted last week to passAB 306 and most of the rest of the package, Rivas discussed the need to make housing more affordable — and to help L.A. County fire victims rebuild as quickly as possible.
“With our vote today, this Assembly will be following through on our commitment to support and assist recovery efforts in Los Angeles,” Rivas said. “Each of these bills contain an urgency clause … because we must move fast to help all Angelenos and all residents of our state.”
This is where Rivas really loses me.
If the Assembly speaker wanted to start a nuanced discussion about electrification and affordability, fine. But he hasn’t done that. He’s forced a bill through the Assembly that assumes California’s climate policies are driving up housing costs. It would deal a harsh blow to our ability to address amajor source of climate pollution.
Similarly, if Rivas wanted to approach housing as a climate solution, that would be great. Building more homes in densely populated urban areas is super important for cutting emissions, because it can limit the number of miles that people need to drive to their jobs — a point that was raised by AB 306’s other author, Assemblymember Nick Schultz (D-Burbank), at last month’s housing committee hearing.
“The transportation sector is probably the single largest-emitting, polluting sector of our economy. When people can afford to live in proximity to where they work, that gets them out of the car driving,” Schultz said.
Unfortunately, that’s not the thrust of AB 306. Rather than take a targeted approach to shifting building codes in ways that might support climate-smart housing development, the bill simply takes for granted that California has nothing left to gain and everything to lose from setting any new standards over the next six years.
It’s no wonder climate champions like Bryan and Muratsuchi don’t want to talk about why they voted “yes.”

DOGE and Trump quash a Klamath River basin comeback,https://www.latimes.com/opinion/story/2025-04-10/klamath-river-basin-dam-removal-salmon-donald-trump,2025-04-10,"The Trump administration ruined what should have been a good spring in the Klamath River basin.
By abruptly laying off federal personnel and freezing payments for already authorized programs and projects, the administration replaced a budding sense of hopefulness in the basin with fear and uncertainty, and tore at fragile bonds years in the making among upper basin ranchers and farmers, federal, state and local governments, nonprofits and Native tribes. In a region where conflict over water has simmered for the last quarter-century, trust was already fragile. Now it is smashed to smithereens.
Through the 21st century the Klamath has lurched from crisis to crisis, usually related to the extended drought that has hovered over the basin most of that time. What distinguishes the current debacle is that it has no relation to natural phenomena. It’s entirely man-made — and entirely unnecessary.
In a welcome harbinger for fish, tribes and the environment, four Klamath River Basin dams will finally come down.
Out of disregard for the needs of ordinary Americans and an apparent desire to eviscerate whatever was championed by his predecessor, Joe Biden, Trump has allowed Elon Musk to take a blunt hatchet to federal expenditures. The result in the Klamath — where votersoverwhelmingly choseTrump in 2024 — is that many people feel fearful and betrayed.
Early last October,the world’s largest dam removal project, entailing the dismantling of four obsolescent Klamath River hydroelectric dams that had blocked salmon from the upper basin since 1918, was completed. More than 6,000 salmon — a number that far exceeded biologists’ predictions — swam upstream past the demolished dams over the next two months. Lower basin tribes, whose cultures and diets revolve around salmon, celebrated.
In conjunction with dam removal, tribes and government agencies launched programs torestore the environmentally ravaged riverafter a century of misguided federal water management. In the upper basin, where drought-induced water scarcity had led to scant allocations to farmers and ranchers, farmers got support from federal programs that promoted increased water efficiency and improved the river system’s dreadful water quality.
Climate & Environment
Reservoirs have been drained as the nation’s largest dam removal effort advances on the Klamath River, and an effort to restore the watershed is taking root.
Many of the efforts were funded by the Biden administration’s 2021 Bipartisan Infrastructure Law. Typically, an environmental nonprofit or a local government body applied for funding to carry out, say, a wetlands restoration contract or upgrades to farmers’ irrigation equipment. When the work was completed, its federal backer was alerted, the funds were released, and the contractors paid and farmers reimbursed.
In a matter of days, Trump and Musk broke the system. Now the nonprofit or agency isn’t able to collect promised funds, and contractors and landowners are left with debts for labor or purchases they’ve paid for, in amounts up to hundreds of thousands of dollars. Some nonprofits are laying off workers and are wondering whether they will survive. Federal agencies’ staffs have been reduced, and some agencies may be forced to move out of the basin entirely.
Funding recipients usually found out about the cuts without a hint of warning. Larry Nicholson is executive director of theUpper Klamath Basin Ag Collaborative, a group of farmers, ranchers, government officials and scientists that has been planning the restoration of a key portion of the river. Having received a $6-million grant from the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, the collaborative has carried out about 40% of planning for the project, but in February, Nicholson said his accountant called him to tell him that the federal government had stopped making deposits.
Climate & Environment
Workers have begun dismantling the largest dam on the Klamath River. Indigenous activists are celebrating a milestone in restoring a free-flowing river.
“I never got an email,” he said. “I never got a phone call. I never got any forewarning. Consequently, I have probably in excess of $250,000 in invoices for work that is already done that I can’t pay.”
Now the planning is shut down, and Nicholson isn’t sure it will continue. Little bombs of debt like this have been exploding all over the basin.
Another example: The Klamath is highly vulnerable to wildfire, and in 2021 it experienced the Bootleg fire, the nation’s largest wildfire that year. Yet Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency blithely laid off U.S. Forest Service workers who were thinning forests and reducing vegetation around homes and other structures. As a result, fire “hardening” in some areas has entirely stopped, and early-fire-detection procedures are weakened.
Climate & Environment
The removal of dams on the Klamath River has enabled salmon to swim far upstream to spawn. Wildlife officials have found salmon upstream in Oregon.
And this: Some federal funding for the basin’s tribes also has been frozen, leaving tribal leaders to wonder whether they will have to shut down crucial departments such as those that track and support salmon recovery.
The question remains: Why?
Whatever savings may be realized from firing federal workers and freezing funds will almost certainly be matched by the costs of abandoning projects before they’re completed, and by spreading so much uncertainty that local businesses, tribes and government agencies remain paralyzed. These cuts have nothing to do with rooting out fraud and waste, which cannot have been discovered by the DOGE slash-and-burn cost-cutters. As former Labor Department Inspector GeneralLarry Turner said recently, a genuine investigation into federal fraud and waste takes about a year, not a few days.
Back on Feb. 28,Musk toldJoe Rogan and his podcast listeners that “the fundamental weakness of Western civilization is empathy,” as if empathy were something else to root out, like river restoration programs. It’s an unusually revealing comment in the context of the Klamath, where the administration’s astonishing lack of empathy is now on garish display.
Jacques Leslie is the author of “Deep Water: The Epic Struggle Over Dams, Displaced People, and the Environment.” He is at work on a book on the Klamath basin.

Democrats running for California governor take digs at Kamala Harris’ delayed decision on the race,https://www.latimes.com/politics/story/2025-04-10/democrats-running-for-california-governor-take-digs-at-kamala-harris-delayed-decision-on-the-race,2025-04-10,"Former Vice President Kamala Harris’ lingering decision about whether to run for governor has other Democrats in the 2026 race steamed, saying the state needs leaders to step up now to protect Californians and combat the destructive policies of President Trump.
The criticism of Harris’ delayed decision, which is expected to come this summer, varies from sharp and direct to oblique and circuitous.
“The challenges facing California are too great for us to wait for a candidate who wants to come in late in the game,” saidformer Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa, who announced his gubernatorial campaign in July. “California is not a steppingstone to higher office.”
California
The wide-open race to succeed Gavin Newsom as California governor has already attracted a large and diverse field of candidates.
He pointed to the unsuccessful, abbreviated campaign Harris had in the 2024 presidential contest because of then-President Biden’s decision to bow out of the race in the summer, months before the election.
“This will not be a coronation,” he said in an interview  this month. “You can’t run at the end of the rainbow. We saw a 100-day campaign. Look what that brought us.”
Former Rep. Katie Porter of Irvine and former U.S. Health and Human Services chief Xavier Becerra, two other top Democrats running for governor, also called out politicians for sitting on the sidelines.
“No one should be waiting to lead. I think we need to make a case right now,”Porter said in a March interview, shortly after she was asked what Harris’ potential entry into the race would mean for her candidacy. “There’s an incredible urgency on the ground that I think stretches across California and across the political spectrum.”
Becerra made a similar point as he announced his candidacy in early April.
“Watching what’s unfolding before our eyes made it clear this is not a time to sit on the sidelines,”Becerra said in an interview.
Polls show that Harris would become the instant front-runner if she decides to jump into the governor’s race. Not only is Harris known nationwide as a former vice president and presidential nominee, but she has a well-established track record of winning statewide races in California.
Harris is expected to make a decision by the end of the summer, according to a source close to the former vice president.
The source pointed to Harris’ experience as San Francisco’s district attorney, the state’s attorney general and U.S. senator before being elected vice president in 2020.
“No one can question her commitment to public service and the people of California and our nation,” this person said. “The vice president’s decisions will always center on how best to serve the people.”
Harris’ success in the state, her name  recognition and her national donor base are among the reasons many expected her to easily clear the field if she enters the governor’s race.
“Her looming as a possible gubernatorial candidate has a very definite chilling effect on everyone else’s fundraising ability,” said veteran Democratic strategist Darry Sragow. “Virtually all donors use any excuse they can to not write a check. … That would be compounded by the fact of the looming uncertain presence here is a very significant political player, presumably the most senior political player in the Democratic field.”
But other California Democratic strategists note that donors’ patience could eventually wear thin at a time when the party is brimming with angst about the large checks they wrote in the 2024 election as well as the policy decisions coming out of the Trump White House.
Tracy Austin, a prominent Los Angeles-based Democratic fundraiser who has ties with several candidates in the race, says there is already mounting frustration in the donor community — not only because of how long Harris is taking to make a decision, but also because of the amount of money they spent on her 2024 presidential campaign as well as broader concerns about the party’s direction.
Fundraising reports aren’t due until July, but candidates are required to report donations over $5,000.
Villaraigosa leads the pack, with about $3.2 million from donors such as director Rob Reiner, producer and television personality Ryan Seacrest and former Walt Disney chief Michael Eisner.
Other candidates have entered the race much more recently, and their footprint among donors who write large checks is far smaller. A little more than $215,000 for Republican County Sheriff Chad Bianco; $133,400 for Porter.
The candidates’ strength among small-dollar donors won’t be visible for months.
Republicans are relishing the prospect of Harris entering the race.  Bianco blasted out a fundraising appeal with a message line invoking Harris’ name.
“Now, the threat that the Democrat leadership poses to our communities is graver than ever before,” he wrote earlier this month. “That’s because Kamala Harris is positioning herself to run for Governor of California. Today, I’m asking you to help me defeat radical Kamala Harris in the race for California Governor.”
Harris’ potential candidacy was frequently raised during the state GOP convention late last month in Sacramento.
“I personally think it’s beneath her, but I welcome it,” outgoing party chairwoman Jessica Millan  Patterson told reporters. “I would love to see her on the ballot.”
Since losing the 2024 election to Trump, Harris has made few public appearances — visiting firefighters and volunteers at the devastating Los Angeles-area wildfires, watching Broadway plays in New York City and accepting an award from the NAACP.
Harris has been circumspect during her few public appearances since losing the 2024 presidential election. On April 3, she made some of hermost pointed remarkssince Trump took office during brief remarks before a gathering of Black  female business leaders, politicians and other prominent people.
Politics
The 2024 Democratic presidential nominee, who may run for California governor, makes surprise speech at Dana Point business conference and criticizes President Trump’s policies.
Harris decried the rollback of fundamental rights under the Trump administration and vowed to remain active in the battle to safeguard constitutional protections.
“I’ll see you out there,” she vowed. “I’m not going anywhere.”

"L.A. County fire-affected beaches are safe for swimming, health officials say",https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2025-04-09/water-advisory-lifted-la-beaches,2025-04-10,"Just in time for amini heat wavegoing into the weekend, local public health authorities have lifted ocean water advisories placed on Malibu- and Santa Monica-area beaches affected by January’s Palisades fire.
Even though officials are deeming the water safe for recreation, they’re still cautioning beachgoers to avoid any fire-related debris they encounter in the ocean.
On Wednesday, the Los Angeles County Department of Public Health announced the ocean water advisory placed on Las Flores State Beach to Santa Monica State Beach had been lifted.
The decision was made based on water testing and analysis conducted by the Los Angeles Regional Water Quality Control Board on the ocean water and sand between the end of January and mid-March.
Both areas were tested for metals, nutrients, polychlorinated biphenyls and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, which are all chemicals that may be found in water runoff based on previous California wildfires, officials said.
Results showed “no chemicals related to wildfires at levels that are dangerous to human health,” according to a news release.
California
Temperatures in the Coachella Valley are forecast to hit 103 degrees by Friday, potentially setting a record high for this time of year and coinciding with the start of the area’s mega-popular music festival.
Beachgoers have the green light to jump into the water at these beaches and hang out on the sand. Public health officials, however, continue to caution that people should avoid fire debris found either in the water or on land.
They also ask that people “avoid being on beaches on or near burned properties, as the fire debris may contain harmful substances and physical hazards such as glass, metal, and sharp wooden debris.”
It’s important to note that high tides can carry fire debris into the ocean, creating hazardous conditions.
“In areas along the coast — particularly near burned or destroyed properties on the inland side of Pacific Coast Highway (PCH) — debris from recent fires has not yet been fully cleaned up,” the new release stated. “As the tides rise, this debris can be swept into the water, posing a danger to those in or near the ocean.”
To stay up to date on current water advisories, including non-fire-related advisories, visit the Department of Public Health’s Ocean Water Qualitywebsite.
Recorded information on beach conditions is available 24 hours a day on the county’s beach closure hotline:(800) 525-5662. A map of affected locations is alsoavailable online.

"Trump makes sweeping move to undercut state climate laws, including California’s",https://www.latimes.com/environment/story/2025-04-09/trump-state-climate-laws-california,2025-04-10,"The Trump administration this week ramped up its efforts to scale back environmental protections nationwide with asweeping executive orderaimed at undermining states’ abilities to set their own environmental policies, including key components of California’s fight against climate change.
In an order dated April 8, the president directed Atty. Gen. Pam Bondi to identify and “stop the enforcement of” state laws that address climate change and other environmental initiatives.
“Many States have enacted, or are in the process of enacting, burdensome and ideologically motivated ‘climate change’ or energy policies that threaten American energy dominance and our economic and national security,” the president wrote in the executive order.
“These State laws and policies are fundamentally irreconcilable with my Administration’s objective to unleash American energy,” he wrote. “They should not stand.”
Climate & Environment
The agency’s plan to repeal or weaken more than two dozen environmental regulations could deliver a direct blow to causes close to the heart of Californians — including air and water quality standards, electric vehicle initiatives and efforts to curb planet-harming greenhouse gas emissions.
The assertion of federal power over states rights seems to go against some of Trump’s other positions — he campaigned, for example, on state’s rights forissues such as abortion.The order calls out several states specifically, including New York and Vermont, which he accuses of “extorting” fossil-fuel companies for their past contributions to planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions.
The order also takes aim at California’s cap-and-trade program — a first-of-its-kind initiative that sets limits on companies’ greenhouse gas emissions and allows them to sell “credits” for unused emissions to other companies.
“California, for example, punishes carbon use by adopting impossible caps on the amount of carbon businesses may use, all but forcing businesses to pay large sums to ‘trade’ carbon credits to meet California’s radical requirements,” the president wrote.
The executive order marks a continuation of Trump’s recent anti-environmental efforts, which have includedcuts to grant funding, widespreadoffice closures and layoffs in the climate research community,loosened regulationsand renewed efforts toexpand the production of oil and coal— two sectors that contribute heavily to global warming.
It also marks an escalation of Trump’s conflict with California. The president in recent months has taken particular aim at the Democratic stronghold, including threatening towithhold disaster aidfor the state’s wildfire response and recovery over issues such as forest management and water policies.
“There’s a little bit of beef right now between Trump and the state,” said Maggie Coulter, a senior attorney with the Climate Law Institute at the nonprofit Center for Biological Diversity. “I think wanting to call out California was part of why cap and trade got mentioned.”
Climate & Environment
A roundup of climate, energy and environmental news from around the American West.
Cap-and-trade isn’t the only California program that could be in the federal government’s cross-hairs. The order directs Bondi to seek out and prioritize state laws that address climate change, environmental justice, greenhouse gas emissions and carbon taxes, which is “kind of like a laundry list of all the things the oil-and-gas industry doesn’t like,” Coulter said.
To that end, the executive order might also affect California’s ability to set strict tailpipe emission standards and its effort to transition to electric vehicles, including a state lawbanning the sale of new gas-powered cars in 2035.
The Trump administration has alreadymade moves to block that law, which are nowplaying out in the courts.
The executive order additionally could impact California’sPolluters Pay Climate Superfund Act of 2025, a bill currently working its way through the state Legislature that would require fossil fuel companies to pay for damage caused by their greenhouse gas emissions. It is similar to the legislation in New York and Vermont that Trump called out in his order, Coulter said.
Blocking those laws would be akin to creating immunity for the fossil-fuel industry from those damages, not unlike protections that shield firearms manufacturers from certain civil lawsuits, according to Cassidy DiPaola, communications director with Make Polluters Pay, a campaign for climate accountability.
“President Trump’s executive order weaponizes the Justice Department against states like California that want to make polluters pay for climate damage,” DiPaola wrote in a statement. “This is the fossil-fuel industry’s desperation on full display — they’re so afraid of facing evidence of their deception in court that they’ve convinced the President to launch a federal assault on state sovereignty.”
Climate & Environment
A bipartisan group of California lawmakers is calling on the Trump administration to preserve federal funding for a hydrogen energy project, saying it is vital for the nation’s future.
Indeed, the oil and gas industry celebrated the order — issued the same week the president also ordered theimmediate expansion of coal productionin the country, including opening federal lands to coal leasing and extending the operating life of existing coal plants.
“We welcome President Trump’s action to hold states like New York and California accountable for pursuing unconstitutional efforts that illegally penalize U.S. oil and natural gas producers for delivering the energy American consumers rely on every day,” read a statement from Ryan Meyers, senior vice president with the American Petroleum Institute.
California appears poised to push back. In a statement, Gov. Gavin Newsom described Trump’s order as a “glorified press release.”
“This is the world the Trump Administration wants your kids to live in,” Newsom said. “California’s efforts to cut harmful pollution won’t be derailed by a glorified press release masquerading as an executive order.”
The governor’s office noted that California continues to make progress when it comes to clean energy, including increasing battery storage 1,600% since 2019 and running on 100% clean electricity for the equivalent of 45 days last year. Greenhouse gas emissions are down 20% since 2000.
The Trump administration has stated that its slew of environmental rollbacks are intended to ease regulatory costs, lower taxes and expand the creation of an “affordable and reliable domestic energy supply.”
“Simply put, Americans are better off when the United States is energy dominant,” Trump’s executive order says.
The order gives Bondi 60 days to compile a list of applicable state climate laws and submit a report to the president regarding actions taken, along with recommendations for additional legislative steps necessary to stop the enforcement of those state laws.
Coulter, of the Climate Law Institute, said actually preventing states from enforcing their laws would be an illegal and unconstitutional overreach.
“It’s not really something that Trump or the attorney general can do,” Coulter said. “If you want to stop the enforcement of state law, you have to go to court, and that’s the jurisdiction of the court.”
Should the administration actually attempt to stop states from enforcing their own laws, she said, lawsuits and legal challenges are almost certain to ensue.

Robot farmworkers. Commercialized memories. Everything is for sale in Alex Rivera’s 2008 sci-fi feature “Sleep Dealer,” in which young, expendable workers from the Global South plug into machines that power the international economy.
Although 17 years have passed since the Latin American cyberpunk film debuted at Sundance — where it won the Waldo Salt Screenwriting Award and the Alfred P. Sloan Prize — its political relevance has not waned. In “Sleep Dealer,” the international borders are closed, but U.S. corporations continue to privatize natural resources and exploit workers in Mexico, where we find our protagonist, a Tijuana robot operator named Memo Cruz. In an America where immigrants areheavily relied uponfor labor, yet increasinglysurveilled,targetedand deported expeditiouslywithout due process, the dystopian realm of “Sleep Dealer” feels closer to our current reality than ever before.
“There’s a sadness in the reason the film is surviving, because its warnings and its insights about the strangeness of techno-capitalism are becoming more relevant over time,” says Rivera. “But I’m also happy that the film is standing the test of time and being used and spoken about.”
As a Peruvian American filmmaker born in New York City, Rivera derived his fictional world-building fromhis real-life experiencedocumenting the harrowing stories of migrants in the United States. Since the 2008 release of his feature film, Rivera has stayed busy: winning a MacArthur Genius Grant and cultivating the next generation of Latino filmmakers bylaunching Borderlands Studiosat the Sidney Poitier New American Film School. And all the while, Rivera said, the audience for “Sleep Dealer” has continued to grow year after year. The movie recently screened in 35mm to a packed house at theAcademy Museum of Motion Picturesin Los Angeles, as part of its “Cyberpunk: Envisioning Possible Futures Through Cinema” series.
When Rivera and I connected via Zoom call, it felt like we were living our own dystopian reality in Los Angeles; I had just finished reporting on the Los Angeles wildfires and Rivera had returned to his home in  Pasadena after evacuating from the Eaton fire. In our latest interview, Rivera discusses the lasting relevance of his film and what he hopes to inspire in viewers today.
This conversation has been edited for clarity and length.
I’m not Mexican American, but I was deeply touched as someone who exists as a part of a diaspora. What was your intention behind making this film primarily in Spanish?
At the beginning of this process, there was this aspiration to make something that had this pop culture pulse, but post-colonial politics ... A lot of the pleasure and the point of “Sleep Dealer” was to invert preconceptions about the future. And one of those is the idea that the future is English, and that the English-speaking world is where the future is being built and written. That is not true. We see it more every year now ... the future is going to be multi-lingual. And so the idea of doing science fiction in Spanish was very exciting, to say that this language is not something of the past, but it’s a component of the future.
In your film, people no longer do physical labor, but they mechanically operate a lot of what we see in the world. In “Sleep Dealer,” the main character, Memo Cruz,operates this robot remotely from Tijuana to construct a building in San Diego. How do you think that added layer of technology in “Sleep Dealer” exemplifies the dehumanization of migrant labor in today’s economic workforce? The argument from both liberals and conservatives around immigrant labor is that we should legalize this group of people because they provide labor to our country.
I start with the basic notion of the alienation of labor that surrounds us every day. The labor that goes into producing food that we consume, clothes that we wear and the buildings that we live in — it’s rendered invisible.
The idea of a worker in another region, in another country, remotely controlling a machine that’s acting and doing things here is an exaggeration or a heightening of that basic dynamic that surrounds us. The systems of technology that are now connecting the planet allow for these extraordinarily extreme and heightened forms of transmission and capture. There’s always a ghost in the machine, no matter [if] a corporation wants to present their product as a transcendental object.
I want to touch on the idea of technology as a form of connection and disconnection. We see Memo trying to get the nodes in his skin so that he can be connected to this global economy. Installing technology under our skin isn’t commonplace (yet), but I see a lot of parallels between how Memo experiences digital apartheid in his world and ours. Just like if you don’t have internet in your town, then you are shut out of this global economy. There are ways that technology can exacerbate existing inequalities.
Memo’s family is from Oaxaca, where a huge corporation has militarized a dam upstream. All of the natural resources are being guarded heavily because of climate-induced scarcity. As you were making this film, how were you thinking about climate change?
Those ideas all came from a simple thesis: that capitalism is amoral and will gobble up anything it’s allowed to gobble up. In this world, capitalism has run wild, captured everything, even the water, and packaged it to sell it back to people from whom it was taken. But then that kind of thinking rolled out and applied to things like our memories. Could our memories be bottled like water and sold? What about our friendships? Our relationships, our time, etc. So this kind of logic of capture, enclosure and commodification is the rationale that binds together all of the world-building of “Sleep Dealer.”
We also see Rudy Ramirez, a fighter drone pilot, rebelling against his directives. He is Mexican American, but he is also an arm of the violence on people who look like him. How do you make sense of that as we consider the limitations of identity politics today?
I find identity politics broadly to be the only way to make sense of American history. You can’t really understand the United States, its past and its present, without looking at the way that race has been structured and formed in this country and deployed to create friction and competition among the working class.
It is true that Black and brown people get swept up in the imperial core and become the enforcers of the regime that perpetuates their exclusion and inequality. Rudy is depicted as an agent of the empire, but there’s a fault line in his being.
We see that in our own families of color, who join the police and the armed forces and are often dispatched to lands that have suffered violence. So the Latino family uprooted because of the U.S. and CIA-backed civil war in El Salvador, coming here, giving birth to a son or a daughter, who then joins the armed forces and is dispatched back to the Global South. These kinds of circles, we see them in our families. It’s a reality that’s rich and complicated, because identity is not abstract.
In the movie you have “coyoteks,” a futuristic version of coyotes who smuggle people across the border to become migrant laborersin the U.S. These coyoteks are also facilitating a transfer of labor by illegally implanting these nodes under their skin. Can you talk a little bit more about your inspiration?
[Melvin Kranzberg] once said, “Technology is not good. Technology is not bad. It’s also not neutral.”
Technology is a shape or a form that enables certain things and disables others, and there’s room to navigate, but there are also constraints. That was the philosophy of “Sleep Dealer.” These technologies, when released into capitalism, are immediately deployed to create forms of alienation, extraction and hyper-profit to create conditions in which corporations and capitalists can move with ease and accelerate their work.
But those forces aren’t the only ones that surround these technologies. Other impulses surround them: the impulse to not be alone, to hear a loved one’s voice, to connect with other people who share your identity group and political commonalities.
When I was developing “Sleep Dealer,” I was very aware of how the Pentagon and corporations were using technology ... but also how the Zapatistas used it, how the World Social Forum used it and how I was using it every day in my life. So the depiction of technology in the film is meant to be one of technology as a kind of battlefield with a powerful tendency towards alienation and extraction.
But the story is not over. There is space in which to hack, to struggle and to create alternatives and strip these technologies out of the capitalist cradle where they were born, to use them for other things.

How L.A. removed 1 million pounds of flammable lithium-ion batteries from its burn zones,https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2025-04-09/l-a-fire-cleanup-what-to-do-with-1-million-pounds-of-highly-flammable-lithium-ion-batteries,2025-04-09,"The fires that swept through Los Angeles County in January left behind more than 1 million pounds of damaged lithium-ion batteries, ranging from slim capsules inside iPhones to the brick-like blocks that run electric vehicles.
Cheap and reliable, lithium-ion batteries have helped the world’s transition to green energy but come with one major risk: When damaged, the batteries can get very hot very quickly, burst open in a puff oftoxic, flammable gasand erupt into flames that are difficult to extinguish.
That level of risk lent new urgency to the cleanup of L.A.’s fire debris. After being exposed to temperatures of more than 2,000 degrees, the thousands of lithium ion batteries left behind in the ruins of more than 13,500 houses and garages could have exploded or caught fire at any time.
Lithium-ion batteries with heat damage are “very unpredictable,” said Keith Glenn, an on-scene coordinator with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. Workers who handle them, he said, sometimes wonder: “Is it going to catch fire? Is it going to become a projectile?”
Lithium-ion batteries became the leading cause of fire deaths in New York City last year and are now a factor in half of the nation’s trash-truck load fires. A fire from a portable battery engulfed a plane on the tarmac in South Korea in January, and U.S. air safety regulators say lithium-ion battery fires occur nearly twice per week.
Federal environmental officials are in the final days of a months-long effort to find the batteries and stop them from catching fire, which involves sifting through fire debris by hand, dunking the batteries in a specialized brine solution, then grinding them into pieces for transportation and recycling. It’s an ugly ending to the power behind some of our most well-designed and beloved devices.
::::
Environmental workers recovered more than 16 times as many batteries from the wreckage of the L.A. fires than in the wildfires that swept Maui in 2023.
That volume reflects not just the scope of the damage here, but also California’s role as an enthusiastic early adopter of green technologies such as solar panels, electric vehicles and the massive wall-mounted battery panels that come with them.
All lithium-ion batteries work roughly the same way: Cells are clustered inside the battery casing, and lithium ions move between the electrodes in each cell, generating an electric current.
The batteries become a risk when they enter thermal runaway, a state that can be triggered by overcharging, manufacturing errors or physical damage that can lead to fire.
“Just like pushing over that first domino ... it can spread,” said Chris Myers, the co-chair of the EPA’s national lithium-ion battery emergency response task force. If the batteries aren’t handled properly, fires can rekindle “days, weeks, months” later, he said. “That’s what we’re trying to prevent.”
In California, the biggest risks are often to garages and streets. The intensity of electric vehicle fires can shut down freeways for hours and sometimes prevent firefighters fromrescuing car-crash victims.
They can also have significant economic impacts: Last fall, a big-rig carrying lithium-ion batteries overturned andcaught firein San Pedro, forcing the closure of several port terminals. About 1,200 people were ordered to evacuate in Monterey County earlier this year after one of the world’s largest battery storage facilities at the Moss Landing Power Plantcaught fire.
When the Biden administration tasked the EPA with cleaning up the lithium-ion battery waste from the Lahaina fire, the island’s geography posed a problem. There were no battery recycling centers on Maui, and ship captains and insurers, wary of fire risks, didn’t want the damaged goods in their cargo.
“We were pushed into a situation where we had to figure it out,” Myers said.
So, the EPA developed what’s now called the “Maui method,” a two-part process for removing stored power from the batteries and crushing them for safe transportation and recycling.
:::
In Los Angeles County, the  labor-intensive process began with mapping the likely locations of more than 5,000 batteries, including about 2,000 in the Palisades and Malibu and 3,000 in Altadena. The list was compiled  with information from car and solar panel companies, public utilities, homeowners and the Department of Motor Vehicles.
Then, hundreds of environmental workers went to the burn zones to sift through the wreckage, house by house, block by block.
The crews working on electric vehicles disconnected the voltage cables to air bags and seat belts, sawed off the tops of the cars, and flipped the vehicles over to access the battery packs underneath. Detaching the thousands of cells underneath and loading the batteries into metal drums could take up to two hours per car.
Los Angeles had a far wider range of electric vehicles than Maui, Glenn said, and each make and model is a little different.
The crews also hunted for wall-mounted battery energy storage systems that connect to solar panels and electric cars. Those devices, which weigh 200 pounds or more, were wrapped in fire blankets and trucked to an EPA temporary processing site to be disassembled.
The EPA’s choice of real estate, including beachfront parking lots and an open space in Irwindale, sparkedfierce backlashfrom residents who didn’t want toxic batteries shreddednear their homesor sensitive waterways.
Westside Councilmember Traci Park expressed surprise earlier this year during one public meeting that batteries were being crushed “just out in the open,” not far from the water.
The EPA installed raised barriers and layers of thick plastic to prevent groundwater runoff and used air-quality monitors to ensure that the battery dust, which contains precious and semiprecious metals, did not contaminate the air. The agency tested the air and soil before starting their operations, and again afterward.
At the Will Rogers State Beach site, workers submerged the recovered batteries in a brine solution made of table salt and baking soda. The batteries soaked for three days or longer in red dumpster-like containers, sometimes emitting bubbles or rust-colored discharge, to reduce their stored energy and reduce the risk of fire.
In the first weeks of the L.A. cleanup, the batteries were then crushed between a steel plate and a drum roller. Flattening the contents of a 55-gallon drum took 30 to 45 minutes in a process that one engineer compared to crushing peanuts into peanut butter.
Breaking the battery’s anodes and cathodes reduces the batteries to what EPA workers call, semi-seriously, “not a battery.” That makes the metal easier to transport, and ensures the batteries won’t reignite.
The EPA ditched the roller method in late March for a simpler solution: two bright blue machines that look like giant sausage grinders. The machines were made in New Jersey by an industrial fabricator that also makes crushers for auto yards and 1-800-GOT-JUNK.
The team at Will Rogers nicknamed the smaller machine “Pork Roll,” after the processed meat popular in the Garden State. About the size of a riding lawn mower, the machine chews through about eight barrels of batteries an hour, eight times faster than the drum roller method.
The larger machine was even faster. On its first day in operation, as ocean waves crashed behind him, an EPA contractor used a Bobcat with a front claw to pick up a metal drum and hold it over the machine’s chute.
Another worker used a long pole to scrape the batteries into the machine. The batteries fell through the teeth and tumbled out of the bottom as a heap of scrap metal.
The not-batteries are shoveled into massive metal containers with soft tops and are trucked to Grassy Mountain, awaste disposal facilityin Utah’s Great Salt Lake Desert, officials said. The battery brining liquid is a hazardous waste product too and is trucked to another specialized facility, the agency said.
The EPA’s Maui method will be used increasingly as Americans rely more heavily on cordless devices, Glenn said, adding : “We love portability, we love being untethered.”
